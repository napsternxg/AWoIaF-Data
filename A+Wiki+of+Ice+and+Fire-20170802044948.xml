[[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] intervenes when she sees [[Dothraki]] warriors raping the women. When she finds Drogo, Daenerys is concerned about her husband\xe2\x80\x99s wounds and calls for the healers. [[Mirri Maz Duur]], one of the women she has rescued, speaks up that she is a healer, and Drogo agrees to let her tend to his wounds in her temple.\n\n==Synopsis==    \n[[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] moves through the trampled fields filled with the dead and wounded around the burning town of the Lamb Men, or [[Lhazareen]]. [[Khal]] [[Ogo]]\xe2\x80\x99s \'\'[[khalasar]]\'\' was attacking the town when Khal [[Drogo]] arrived. Daenerys remembers that Khal Ogo was among those who shared the high bench at the [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 46|feast]] when [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]] was crowned. However, this is not [[Vaes Dothrak]]. Daenerys suspects some of the villagers probably mistook them for deliverance, but once Khal Ogo was defeated Drogo\xe2\x80\x99s \'\'khalasar\'\' plundered the town just as badly. \n\nNow the captives from both the village and Ogo\xe2\x80\x99s \'\'khalasar\'\' are being collected for slaves. To an outsider the Lhazareen look similar to the Dothraki, but now Daenerys can plainly see the differences. In addition, the Dothraki captives do not seem to fear slavery, while the villagers stumble about in fear and sorrow.\n\nSer [[Jorah Mormont]] meets Daenerys at the entrance to the village. The knight brings news that Drogo has killed Khal Ogo and [[Fogo|his son]], taking only minor wounds. He also informs her that most of the rival \'\'khalasar\'\' has fled, but there could still be as many as 10,000 captives. Ser Jorah says he has suggested they drive the slaves south to [[Meereen]] where they will fetch a better price; more than enough gold to hire the ships they need to reach the [[Seven Kingdoms]]. As she watches the carnage around her, Daenerys can only think about the price of the [[Iron Throne]]. \n\nThe scenes of rape disturb Daenerys the most. She orders Ser Jorah and her [[khas|bodyguards]] [[Jhogo]] and [[Quaro]] to stop the rape of a [[Eroeh|wailing girl]]. Ser Jorah tries to explain that this is not wise since she is depriving the riders of their reward for shedding blood for their \'\'khal\'\'. Jhogo and Quaro point out that the Dothraki believe the girl should feel honored and even Daenerys\xe2\x80\x99 handmaid [[Irri]] agrees. Daenerys is not dissuaded and commands Ser Jorah and the others to stop the rape. Ser Jorah declares that she truly is [[Rhaegar Targaryen]]\xe2\x80\x99s sister and obeys.\n\nStopping the rape requires the death of two of the rapers. When asked what to do with the raped girl, Daenerys commands [[Doreah]] to tend to her hurts, mainly because the blonde-haired [[Lys|Lysene]] girl does not look Dothraki. Daenerys then rides on into the settlement and begins to rescue all of the other rape victims she sees. Ser Jorah tries to explain that she cannot save them all, but Daenerys refuses to believe him. \n\nDaenerys finds Drogo with an arrow through his arm and an \'\'[[arakh]]\'\' cut that has taken off one of his nipples. Drogo insists that they are only scratches and boasts that he personally slew not only Khal Ogo, but also his son [[Fogo]], who was \'\'khal\'\' after Ogo. Daenerys praises her husband.\n\nThen a warrior named [[Mago]], who rides with the \'\'[[khas]]\'\' of [[Ko]] [[Jhaqo]], rides up with angry words about Daenerys\xe2\x80\x99 actions. After listening to both sides, Drogo explains to Daenerys that rape is part of the Dothraki way of war. Daenerys insists that the Lhazareen women should be made wives and given a place in the \'\'khalasar\'\'. A [[bloodrider]] named [[Qotho]] asks haughtily if a horse breeds with sheep, but Daenerys replies that a dragon feeds on both horse and sheep. Drogo laughs at this and proclaims that his son inside her has made Daenerys fierce. The \'\'khal\'\' goes on to tell Mago to find another lamb to mount, as these belong to the \'\'[[khaleesi]]\'\'.\n\n[[File:Mirri Maz Duur.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Mirri Maz Duur, a [[godswife]] of the [[Lhazareen]].]]\n\nWhen Drogo reaches out to Daenerys, he winces and Daenerys cries for the healers. She is told that Drogo sent the healers away to tend the more grievously wounded. [[Mirri Maz Duur]], a Lhazareen woman Daenerys rescued, speaks up, saying she can help. [[Aggo]] is about to cut her throat when Daenerys demands that the woman, who wears the remains of fine clothing, be allowed to speak. Mirri Maz Duur explains that she is a healer and [[godswife]]. Drogo\xe2\x80\x99s [[bloodrider]]s mistrust her, naming her a healer of sheep and a \'\'[[maegi]]\'\'. \n\nDaenerys asks Mirri Maz Duur how she learned to become a healer, and the godswife states that she has learned from many including a [[maester]] named [[Marwyn]]. Talk of a maester immediately interests Ser Jorah, and he asks for details. Ser Jorah then tells Daenerys that maesters know much of healing. Mirri Maz Duur explains that the [[Great Shepherd]] sent her to earth to heal all his lambs. Drogo finally speaks up and permits the godswife to heal him. Mirri Maz Duur suggests that the healing magic will be stronger inside her temple. Drogo rises to walk and falters, but he refuses [[Haggo]]\xe2\x80\x99s offer to help. Seeing that her husband is weak, Daenerys moves up to help him, telling him that since she is not a man she can help him. \n\nMirri Maz Duur brings Drogo into the remains of her temple and says it is best if the rest leave, but Daenerys and the bloodriders refuse. Daenerys assures everyone that Mirri Maz Duur will do no harm, feeling she can trust a woman she saved from rape. The godswife says if they insist on remaining they can help hold Drogo down. She pulls out the arrow, pours boiling wine on the wound, then sews the skin back in place. Next, she applies a plaster of leaves to the chest wound and instructs Drogo not to drink wine or [[milk of the poppy]] or to remove the poultice for ten days. When told he will have a great scar, Drogo declares, \xe2\x80\x9cI sing of my scars.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nDaenerys asks the godswife about an earlier comment about birthing songs and learns she is also a midwife. Therefore, she asks Mirri Maz Duur to attend her when she gives birth. Drogo tells her, \xe2\x80\x9cYou do not ask a slave, you tell her.\xe2\x80\x9d Then Drogo commands that the \'\'khalasar\'\' must ride and leaves. Qotho lingers long enough to remind the godswife, \xe2\x80\x9cAs the \'\'khal\'\' fares, so shall you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/10/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-30 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/062/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 61]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Daenerys Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in the Dothraki Sea]]\n\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 62, Daenerys]][[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\x94\xd1\x8d\xd0\xb9\xd0\xbd\xd0\xb5\xd1\x80\xd0\xb8\xd1\x81 VII]]</text>\n      <sha1>p4xffng6ets87d2azod36pi2bkg2mu5</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 54</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5683</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>189373</id>\n      <parentid>183774</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-07-19T20:52:48Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Nittanian</username>\n        <id>3504</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3979">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Davos Seaworth|Davos]]\n| title\t\t= Davos V\n| place         = [[Dragonstone]]\n| page\t\t= 597\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 53|Tyrion VI]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 54|Davos V]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 55|Jon VII]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 36|Davos IV]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 63|Davos VI]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Salladhor Saan]] tells King [[Stannis Baratheon]] of the [[Red Wedding]], how the [[House Frey|Freys]] sewed the head of [[Robb Stark]]\'s direwolf, [[Grey Wind]], on the king\'s shoulders and nailed a crown on its head. [[Catelyn Stark]] was slain and thrown naked into the river. Queen [[Selyse Florent|Selyse]] and [[Axell Florent]] declare that it was the hand of [[R\'hllor]] that killed the usurpers, but Stannis knows it was Lord [[Walder Frey]]\'s handiwork. When Stannis wants to send word that he will pardon any [[ironborn|ironman]] or [[north]]man who swears fealty, [[Melisandre]] tells him that her flames revealed that new kings will pick up where the old ones died. The [[Seven Kingdoms]] must be shown a sign, but Stannis has heard enough talk of stone dragons, knowing of all the follies the [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]] caused by trying to return the [[dragon]]s to life. \n\n[[Davos Seaworth]] persuades the king by asking Melisandre why she needs [[Edric Storm]]\'s life to raise the stone dragon. He also inquires how her leeches were responsible for two kings\' deaths, when one was killed by Walder Frey and the other, [[Balon Greyjoy]], fell from a bridge. He also points out that only two of the three false kings are dead so far. The Red Woman has answers, but Stannis sends her away. Still not completely satisfied that he should spare Edric\'s life, the king sends Davos away as well. \n\nThe Onion Knight seeks out Maester [[Pylos]], who has been teaching him how to read. Davos begins to slowly read a letter that arrived some time before from the [[Wall]]. The missive speaks of Lord [[Jeor Mormont]]\'s [[fight at the Fist|defeat at the Fist]], and Maester [[Aemon Targaryen (son of Maekar I)|Aemon]]\'s fear that the [[wildling]]s may conquer the Wall. Pylos reveals that he showed the letter to [[Alester Florent|Alester]], but the king and Melisandre are not aware of the warning\'s existence.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Salladhor Saan]]\n*[[Stannis Baratheon]]\n*[[Grey Wind]]\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Catelyn Stark]]\n*[[Selyse Florent]]\n*[[Axell Florent]]\n*[[Walder Frey]]\n*[[Melisandre]]\n*[[Edric Storm]]\n*[[Balon Greyjoy]]\n*[[Davos Seaworth]]\n*[[Pylos]]\n*[[Jeor Mormont]]\n*[[Aemon Targaryen (son of Maekar I)|Aemon]]\n*[[Alester Florent]]\n}}\t\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Red Wedding]]\n*[[House Frey]]\n*[[R\'hllor]]\n*[[Seven Kingdoms]]\n*[[House Targaryen]]\n*[[Fight at the Fist]]\n*[[Wildlings]]\n}}\n\n\n==References and Notes==\n*The synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/06/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-32 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Part 32].

He passes his time chatting to the guards, gaining a few favours in the form of candles, books, paper &amp; a quill, as well as learning a little more about the general history of the north. Davos writes a few letters to his sons to be delivered upon his death. It is then that [[Robett Glover]] appears at his door and politely asks him to follow; Davos is wary but notes his mannerisms and follows. \n\nHe is led through secret hallways always going in different directions, passing the old godswood on the way. Eventually they end up in a room of the [[New Castle]] where Lord [[Wyman Manderly]] is waiting for him. He declines the offers of food and wine; Lord Wyman though, apologizes for his poor treatment of Davos. Wyman tells him that they must talk fast, as the [[House Frey|Freys]] wait above, and Davos can hear the sounds of music and chatter above. Lord Wyman says that they must act quickly for Davos is &quot;dead&quot; and his head sits upon the Seal Gate. A criminal similar in appearance to Davos was executed in his place, his head and hands (with fingers carefully shortened) mounted on the wall. He then learns that Lord Wyman Manderly only plays along with the Freys because he has to, as his son [[Wylis Manderly]] is being held hostage, though he drinks for his safe return.&lt;ref&gt;As we learned in [[A Feast for Crows]], [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 17|Chapter 17 (Cersei IV)]], pages 277-278 (UK MMP edition; \'\'circa\'\' page 246 in the US and UK Hardcover Editions)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDavos says he was quite convinced by Wyman\'s daughters\' behaviour, though he was confused by [[Wylla Manderly]]. Wyman responds that his young granddaughter was extremely brave to have said those things. There was truth in her words as the debt the [[House Manderly|Manderlys]] owe the [[House Stark|Starks]] and [[Winterfell]] can never be repaid. He adds though that he cannot show any sign of contempt to [[King\'s Landing]] for fear of the harm they might do to his son. [[Tywin Lannister]] told Wyman that he must confess his treason, yield White Harbor, declare his loyalty to [[Tommen Lannister|King Tommen]], and bend his knee to [[Roose Bolton]]. If he refused, Wylis would be killed as a traitor, White Harbor would be sacked and his people would &quot;suffer the same fates as the [[House Reyne|Reynes]] of Castamere&quot;. If he complies, his son will be released. By &quot;killing&quot; Davos, he has proved his loyalty to the Iron Throne and assured the release of Wylis, which Davos notes is a brave move.\n\nWyman adds that he has been unable to send Stannis more information in his letters because the Freys infest his court, looking for any sign of treachery and his [[maester]] [[Theomore]] is [[House Lannister of Lannisport|a distant cousin to the Lannisters]], so Manderly does not trust him. Manderly goes on to add his rage at his son [[Wendel Manderly]]\'s death at the hands of the Freys, calling it murder and the Freys\' claims fables. He tells Davos that the [[The North|North]] remembers and his son is home, meaning that his act for the Freys is almost over as well.\n\nHe then summons [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]]\'s mute squire [[Wex Pyke|Wex]], who survived the [[Sack of Winterfell]]. Davos is told by Robett that Theon was captured at Winterfell, and is currently being flayed by the Boltons. He adds that all the women were also captured and marched away. Davos listens to the horrible things that [[Ramsay Bolton]] does to the captured women, sending them naked into the woods with half a day\'s head start before hunting them down with his dogs. Every so often, according to Manderly, some wench lives to tell the tale, but most aren\'t as lucky. If caught, they are raped, flayed and their corpses fed to his dogs, while their skins adorn the [[Dreadfort]]. If he considered them good sport, he slits their throats before he flays them, otherwise it is the other way around. \n\nRobett tells a stunned Davos that the evil is in Ramsay\'s blood, sired from rape. Wyman adds that the Freys are no better than Ramsay. He also tells Davos that Roose lies and played a darker part in the [[Red Wedding]] than he has admitted. In addition, Davos is told that the Boltons and Freys know the northmen are not expected to believe their lies but will be forced to accept them or else die as well.\n\nHe tells Davos about the mighty fleet he has built up, which Davos saw when he entered the port. Furthermore he has plenty of silver in his vaults and has more heavy horse than anyone else north of [[The Neck]]. Wyman states that [[Oldcastle]] and [[Widow\'s Watch]] will follow his lead, all of the lands east of the [[White Knife]], from Widow\xe2\x80\x99s Watch and [[Ramsgate]] to the [[Sheepshead Hills]] and the headwaters of the [[Broken Branch]] will be pledged to [[Stannis Baratheon]] if Davos meets his one price. He says he does not need a king but a smuggler. He needs Davos to smuggle home [[Rickon Stark]], his true liege, and one who holds a stronger claim than [[Arya Stark|Arya]], who is soon to be wed to Ramsay Bolton.\n\nThe true story about what happened at Winterfell comes out then; Wex hid in the godswood, and [[Rodrik Cassel]] was murdered by Ramsay Bolton. Wex also says that six survived the siege, two of them the sons of [[Eddard Stark]]. Four of the people went north and two went another way.

That night, Arya dreams the wolf dream again, and she watches as the other wolves feast on corpses by the river. She follows a scent that leads her to [[Catelyn Stark|her mother]]\xe2\x80\x99s body, and pulls it from the river. Looking at the corpse, Arya\xe2\x80\x99s wolf-self thinks &quot;Rise. Rise and eat and run with us.&quot; Then, the pack notices men approaching and flees. Arya wakes up. At some point they encounter a survivor from the [[Red Wedding]], a bowman in service to Ser [[Marq Piper]]. The man is injured, and they give him water, then Sandor gives him [[the gift of mercy]]. Later, she and Sandor take on work in a village in the foothill of the [[Mountains of the Moon]], and learn that the [[Vale mountain clans]] have grown bolder and now carry steel. Realizing they will never reach the Eyrie, Clegane decides to head back to [[Riverrun]] and attempt to ransom Arya to the [[Brynden Tully|Blackfish]]. Arya tells the Hound that he has lost his belly for fighting since he ran from the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], but he just laughs at her.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Arya Stark]]\n*[[Sandor Clegane]] The [[Hound]]\n*[[Lysa Arryn]]\n*[[Catelyn Stark]]\n*[[Nymeria (direwolf)|Nymeria]]\n*[[Brynden Tully]] Blackfish\n}}\t\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*The [[Twins]]\n*[[Vale mountain clans]]\n*[[Riverrun]]\n*[[Eyrie]]\n*[[Battle of the Blackwater]]\n}}\n\n\n==References and Notes==\n* The synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/08/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-39 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Part 39].

His four thousand [[wildlings]] will be allowed past the wall, including mammoths and giants. They must leave one hundred boys as hostages at [[Castle Black]], and yield all valuables to pay for food. The mammoths are to go the long way around through [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea|Eastwatch]] while the rest are allowed to go through the gates.\n\nJon accompanies [[Val]] to go see [[Selyse Florent|Queen Selyse]] to tell her of the bargain. The queen is excited and tells him that her husband will be proud, all the wildlings have to do is swear fealty to the king and convert to [[R\'hllor]]. This is when Jon tells her that this was not part of the bargain, and Val adds that the free folk do no kneel. Selyse is quite upset about this. Val notices [[Shireen Baratheon|Shireen]]\'s facial disfigurements, noting that it is [[greyscale|grey death]]. Jon tells her that it is not always fatal, but she is adamant that it is death, and that the baby &quot;monster&quot; must be taken out of that tower at once and closer to her own person. She insists that Shireen is dead and that the queen and apparently Jon cannot see it.\n\nHe then goes to the top of the wall, wondering what has happened to [[Mance Rayder]] and if he has found his sister [[Arya Stark|Arya]]. Up here he meets [[Torghen Flint]] of the [[House Flint of the mountains|first Flints]] and [[Brandon Norrey]], the [[House Norrey|Norrey clan]] chief. Jon tells them that the wildlings are coming through, though they are not happy about it because of past conflicts. He tells them that they must forgive crimes of the past if they are to live together. They are worried about their lands, but Jon tells them the wildlings are to remain on the wall in the abandoned castles.\n\n[[Bowen Marsh]] sees this agreement as a betrayal of Jon\'s vows to the [[Night\'s Watch]]. However, Jon says that he is sworn to defend the realms of men and asks him whether the people beyond the wall don\'t count as men. Thus it is his intent to use all available resources to defend the realm of men against [[The Others]].\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Tormund|Tormund Giantsbane]]\n*[[Mance Rayder]]\n*[[Jon Snow]]\n*[[Dormund]]\n*[[Stannis Baratheon]]\n*[[Richard Horpe]]\n*[[Torwynd]]\n*[[Munda]]\n*[[Ryk|Longspear Ryk]]\n*[[Aerys II Targaryen]]\n*[[Toregg|Tall Toregg]]\n*[[Leathers]]\n*[[Hareth (Mole\'s Town)|Hareth]], the &quot;Horse&quot;\n*[[Ghost]]\n*[[Jeor Mormont]]\n*[[Val]]\n*[[Axell Florent]]\n*[[Mully]]\n*&quot;[[The abomination|Little monster]]&quot;\n*[[Selyse Florent]]\n*[[Wun Weg Wun Dar Wun]]\n*[[Dalla]]\n*[[Mother Mole]]\n*[[Cotter Pyke]]\n*[[Melisandre]]\n*[[Ulmer]]\n*[[Satin]]\n*[[Bowen Marsh]]\n*[[Othell Yarwyck]]\n*[[Cellador]]\n*[[Clydas]]\n*[[Samwell Tarly]]\n*[[Hobb|Three-Finger Hobb]]\n*[[Patrek of King\'s Mountain]]\n*[[Patchface]]\n*[[Shireen Baratheon]]\n*[[Wildling prince]]\n*[[Edric Storm]]\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n*[[Ty]]\n*[[Owen the Oaf|Owen]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Arya Stark]]\n*[[Mikken]]\n*[[Ramsay Bolton]]\n*[[Brandon Norrey]]\n*[[Torghen Flint]]\n*[[Denys Mallister]]\n*[[Weeper]]\n*[[Black Jack Bulwer]]\n*[[Hairy Hal]]\n*[[Garth Greyfeather]]\n*[[Janos Slynt]]\n}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 53]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Jon Snow]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Castle Black]]\n\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 53]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 54, Jon]]</text>\n      <sha1>fo2v6nd9uaayaagg6by60cv5rj7jz6s</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Feast for Crows-Chapter 10</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>4252</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166942</id>\n      <parentid>162488</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-06-05T18:20:52Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4724">{{Infobox Chapter AFfC\n| pov\t\t= [[Sansa Stark]]\n| title\t\t= Sansa I\n| place         = the [[Eyrie]]\n| page\t\t= 145\n| previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 9|Brienne II]]\n| current\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 10|Sansa I]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 11|The Kraken\'s Daughter]]\n| arc previous\t= \n| arc next\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 23|Sansa II]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Marillion]] is singing day and night. Because [[sky cell|his cell]] is open, his songs can be heard throughout the castle. Although Marillion has a beautiful voice, [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] does not like the sound of his singing. She asks [[Petyr Baelish|Petyr]] if he cannot silence the singer. Littlefinger explains to Sansa that they need Marillion. With some persuasion, Marillion has confessed to the murder of [[Lysa Arryn|Lysa]]. In return for his confession, Littlefinger has spared his life and his voice. Petyr tells Sansa that she has to corroborate Marillion\'s confession. Sansa knows that Marillion did not murder Lysa and therefore hesitates. She has no pity for the singer as he has tried to rape her, but she is afraid that people will see through her lies.  \n\nThe next day [[Nestor Royce]] and [[Albar Royce|his son]] arrive at the Eyrie to investigate the murder of Lysa Arryn. Although she is afraid, Sansa tells the Royces that Marillion killed Lysa Arryn. Her fright and tears only make her more convincing. Then Marillion is led in. He confesses that he killed his mistress because he could not bear the thought of seeing her married to Petyr. The Royces never liked Marillion and don\xe2\x80\x99t question his confession. They agree that Marillion will be confined to the sky cells. Eventually he will fall or jump to his death. \n\nNestor then informs Petyr that [[Yohn Royce|his cousin]] is gathering other lords to have Petyr removed as Lord Protector of the Vale. Littlefinger already knows this and is unfazed. As a reward for his services, he presents Nestor with a grant that makes him and his descendents hereditary Lords of the [[Gates of the Moon]]. The Gates of the Moon are a secondary castle that has always been in the possession of the [[House Arryn|main Arryn line]]. Nestor has been appointed castellan but now acquires the castle in his own right. According to Petyr, Lysa had already decided to give the castle to Nestor but was murdered before she could sign the order. When Nestor Royce and his son leave, Littlefinger explains to Sansa that the Royces will now be on his side. If Petyr is removed as Lord Protector, the grant for the castle will be challenged because it was signed by Petyr and not by little [[Robert Arryn|Robert]].\n\nThat night when Sansa goes to sleep, Robert creeps into her bed as he has been doing since his mother died. He asks Sansa if she is his mother now. Sansa says yes because she knows this lie will soothe him.\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Sansa Stark]]\n*[[Petyr Baelish]]\n*[[Marillion]]\n*[[Robert Arryn]]\n*[[Nestor Royce]]\n*[[Albar Royce]]\n*Maester [[Colemon]]\n*[[Gretchel]]\n*[[Maddy]]\n*[[Marwyn Belmore]]\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentionned\'\'\'\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n*[[Jonquil]]\n*[[Jenny of Oldstones]]\n*[[Duncan Targaryen|Prince of Dragonflies]]\n*[[Lysa Arryn]]\n*[[Lothor Brune]]\n*[[Jon Arryn]]\n*[[Mord]]\n*[[Catelyn Tully]]\n*[[Cersei Lannister]]\n*[[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n*[[Sandor Clegane]]\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentionned\'\'\'\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Garlan Tyrell]]\n*[[Dontos Hollard]]\n*[[Florian the Fool]]\n*[[Bran Stark]]\n*[[Rickon Stark]]\n*[[Edmure Tully]]\n*[[Brynden Tully]]\n*[[Black Robin]]\n*[[Alysanne Targaryen]]\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n*[[Yohn Royce]]\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentionned\'\'\'\n*[[Symond Templeton]]\n*[[Anya Waynwood]]\n*[[Benedar Belmore]]\n*[[Gilwood Hunter]]\n*[[Horton Redfort]]\n*[[Sam Stone]]\n*[[Lyonel Corbray]]\n*[[Lyn Corbray]]\n*[[Jasper Arryn]]\n*[[Ronnel Arryn]]\n*[[Denys Arryn]]\n*[[Oswell Kettleblack]]\n|}\n\n==Places==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n*[[Winterfell]]\n*[[Eyrie]]\n*[[Gates of the Moon]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n*[[King\'s Landing]]\n*[[Riverrun]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n*[[The Twins]]\n*[[Wendish Town]]\n|}\n\n==References and Notes==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/03/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-feast-for-crows-part-7 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Feast for Crows, Part 7].

They discuss the murder of King [[Robert I Baratheon|Robert]]\xe2\x80\x99s [[Barra|bastard daughter]], [[Eddard Stark]]\xe2\x80\x99s execution, and candidates for Commander of the [[City Watch of King\'s Landing|City Watch]]. Tyrion then has Slynt taken into custody to join the [[Night\'s Watch]]. Afterward, he discusses the same topics with [[Varys]]. \n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] offers more wine to his dinner guest, Lord [[Janos Slynt]]. The butcher\xe2\x80\x99s son accepts and asks if the wine is from the [[Arbor]]. Tyrion replies that the wine is actually an uncommonly rich [[Dorne|Dornish]] vintage. Slynt compliments Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s gift for words, calling him a lord, but Tyrion points out that Slynt is the true lord and a simple \xe2\x80\x9cTyrion\xe2\x80\x9d will suffice. He notes that Slynt does not sip his wine and is so drunk he dribbles onto his fine clothes. Unlike Slynt, Tyrion has gone easy on the wine but certainly not the food, since one of his first acts as [[Hand of the King|Hand]] was to hire the finest cook in the city. Slynt is very impressed with the food and says perhaps he will hire Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s cook to serve him at [[Harrenhal]]. Tyrion quips that wars have been fought over less.\n\n[[File:Janos Slynt by henning.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Janos Slynt - by Henning Ludvigsen \xc2\xa9FFG]]\n\nTyrion declares Slynt a bold man to take a grim and allegedly cursed place like Harrenhal as his seat. Slynt dismisses the superstition and insists it takes a bold man to rise as he and Tyrion have. Tyrion refills Slynt\xe2\x80\x99s cup as he asks about Slynt\xe2\x80\x99s list of proposed successors as Commander of the [[City Watch of King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing|City Watch]]. Slynt opines that he would choose [[Allar Deem]], whom he describes as a good and loyal man. Tyrion says he is considering Ser [[Jacelyn Bywater]], a distinguished knight whose name does not appear on Slynt\xe2\x80\x99s list. Slynt argues that Bywater is rigid and thinks overmuch of himself and his honor, insisting that Allar Deem is the one Tyrion wants. Tyrion remarks that Allar Deem is little loved in the streets, but Slynt insists he is feared, which is better. Tyrion brings up that Deem killed a young whore and her [[Barra|infant daughter]]. Slynt explains that only the child was supposed to die, but the mother got in the way. He says he chose Deem because Deem is a hard man who always follows orders and never speaks of it afterward. Tyrion asks who ordered Slynt to kill the whore\xe2\x80\x99s bastard, but Slynt insists he prides himself on being as tight-lipped as Allar Deem.\n\nTyrion suggests that [[Jeor Mormont]], [[Lord Commander of the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch]], could use men like Slynt and Deem, but Slynt responds that there is small chance of that. Tyrion points out that life takes queer turns, as it did with [[Eddard Stark]], who never imagined he would die on the steps of [[Great Sept of Baelor|Baelor\xe2\x80\x99s Sept]]. Slynt laughs that few did and confirms that even [[Varys]] was surprised. Slynt also confirms the execution was King [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]]\xe2\x80\x99s decision, and seems confused when Tyrion points out [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] planned to allow Stark to take the black. \n\nTyrion comments on Slynt\xe2\x80\x99s new bloody spear sigil, and asks if Slynt drove the spear into Eddard Stark\xe2\x80\x99s back himself or if he only gave the command. Angered, Slynt insists Stark was a traitor who tried to buy him. Tyrion replies, \xe2\x80\x9cLittle dreaming that you had already been sold.\xe2\x80\x9d Slynt declares he will not have his honor questioned, but Tyrion retorts that Slynt has no honor, though he does admit a spear thrust in the back is a good bargain for a lordship and a castle. Slynt rises and demands what right Tyrion has to chastise him. Tyrion points out that Slynt knows exactly who he is and should thank the gods he does not have to deal with Lord [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] instead.\n\n[[File:Jacelyn Bywater.jpg|thumb|270px|right|Ser Jacelyn Bywater \xe2\x80\x93 by Patrick McEvoy \xc2\xa9FFG]]\n\nTyrion declares Slynt\xe2\x80\x99s two [[Jothos Slynt|younger]] [[Danos Slynt|sons]] will become squires and the [[Morros Slynt|eldest]] will inherit his title and sufficient lands, but not Harrenhal. Then Tyrion explains that the carrack \'\'[[Summer\'s Dream]]\'\' will take Slynt to [[the Wall]], where he is to join the [[Night\'s Watch]] and give Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s regards to Lord Commander Mormont. Enraged, Slynt declares he has powerful friends like King Joffrey, [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]], and Queen Cersei; perhaps Tyrion will be the one banished to [[the Wall]].\n\nAs Slynt throws open the door to leave, he comes face to face with Ser Jacelyn Bywater, whom Tyrion introduces as the new commander of the City Watch. As six gold cloaks usher Slynt away, Tyrion hands Slynt\xe2\x80\x99s list of successors to Bywater and asks him to see they accompany Slynt to [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]], adding that it would not be taken amiss if Allar Deem was swept overboard.\n\nSoon after, Varys glides into the hall to praise Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s actions. Tyrion comments that he is tempted to do Varys the same as Deem. Varys replies that Tyrion might be disappointed: the storms come and go, but he keeps on paddling. Tyrion accuses the eunuch of concealing that Cersei sent gold cloaks to kill King [[Robert I Baratheon|Robert]]\xe2\x80\x99s bastards. Varys asks forgiveness, but Tyrion refuses, angry that he must make a show of punishing the likes of Slynt and Deem while his sister continues on her savage course.\n\nTyrion insists Varys tell him everything he knows from now on, but Varys only says he knows quite a lot. Tyrion points out Varys did not know enough to save the whore and her child. Varys says he took steps to save another bastard, an [[Gendry|older boy]], but assures Tyrion he never dreamed the baseborn daughter of a whore would be considered a threat. Tyrion remarks that being Robert\xe2\x80\x99s was enough of a threat for Cersei. Varys blames himself, and comments that the whore loved King Robert. Thinking of [[Shae]] and [[Tysha]], Tyrion wonders if a whore can truly love anyone. He recalls that, although he provided her with a rich manse and fine gifts, when he said Shae served him best between the sheets it was not what she wanted to hear.\n\nTyrion remarks that it seems Joffrey is truly to blame for Eddard Stark\xe2\x80\x99s death, though Slynt and Ser [[Ilyn Payne]] carried out the sentence almost as if they expected it. Varys states that Tyrion can prevent further follies with the support of the gold cloaks, but there are still Cersei\xe2\x80\x99s household red cloaks to consider. Tyrion responds that they are loyal to [[Casterly Rock]] and outnumbered by his [[Vale mountain clans]]men, not to mention six thousand gold cloaks if Bywater is the man Varys claims.\n\n[[File:MarcSimonetti Varys the spider.jpg|thumb|290px|left|Varys the spymaster - by MarcSimonetti\xc2\xa9]]\n\nTyrion does not trust Varys, but cannot deny his usefulness. He asks Varys why he is so helpful and Varys replies, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are the Hand. I serve the realm, the king, and you.\xe2\x80\x9d Tyrion asks, \xe2\x80\x9cAs you served [[Jon Arryn]] and Eddard Stark?\xe2\x80\x9d but Varys states he served as best he could, and he does not think Tyrion will share the same fate, since power is a curious thing. Varys brings up the riddle he asked Tyrion [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 3|before]]. Tyrion says the answer depends on the [[sellsword]], who holds the power of life and death. Varys wonders aloud why men pretend kings hold power if this is true. Tyrion points out that kings can call other swordsmen, but Varys only asks why these other swordsmen obey rather than rule. Neither the godly [[High Septon]], nor the lawful Queen Regent, nor the ever-knowledgeable Varys could prevent Eddard Stark\xe2\x80\x99s death, so who truly killed him: Joffrey who gave the command, Ser Ilyn who swung the sword, or another? When Tyrion asks for the answer to the riddle, Varys declares that power resides where men believe it resides. Tyrion asks if power is just a trick, and Varys agrees it is a shadow on the wall, though shadows can kill and often a very small man can cast a very large shadow. \n\nTyrion smiles and declares he is growing fond of Varys, and though he may kill him yet he thinks he will feel sad about it. Varys declares he will take that as high praise. Tyrion asks what Varys is, but Varys only says he is a loyal servant of the realm. Tyrion presses on to ask who made Varys a eunuch and who he \'\'truly\'\' is. Varys\xe2\x80\x99 smile never flickers, but his eyes show a very different emotion as he insists his tale is long and sad.\n\nVarys draws a parchment from his sleeve and reveals the master of the galley \'\'White Hart\'\' plans to defect to Lord [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]. Tyrion sighs that they should make an example of the man, which will serve both to discourage other captains and to keep Joffrey busy. Next, Varys informs him Ser [[Horas Redwyne|Horas]] and Ser [[Hobber Redwyne]] have bribed a guard and plan to escape on the [[Pentos]]hi galley \'\'[[Moonrunner]]\'\'. Tyrion instructs Varys to have Bywater send the guard to the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch and post a guard on the \'\'Moonrunner\'\' just in case. Next, Varys notes that the clansman [[Timett]] killed a man for cheating at tiles. When Varys confirms the man \'\'was\'\' cheating, Tyrion declares Timett did all honest men a favor. Next, Varys explains that the [[red comet]] has brought all manner of prophets to the city to preach doom and destruction. Tyrion instructs Varys to let them rant. Finally, Varys states that when Lord [[Gyles Rosby]] proposed a toast to the king, Ser [[Balon Swann]] remarked they would need three cups for that and many laughed. Tyrion insists he is not interested in treasonous table talk, which Varys calls wise.\n\nTyrion returns to his solar to find [[Bronn]] waiting. The sellsword asks about Slynt, and Tyrion admits he has likely replaced one of Littlefinger\xe2\x80\x99s men with one of Varys\xe2\x80\x99. Tyrion asks how the recruiting is going, and Bronn explains that he only hires the sellswords who make a good impression in a duel. Tyrion asks if Bronn has killed any candidates, and Bronn answers, \xe2\x80\x9cNo one we could have used.\xe2\x80\x9d Tyrion asks what should happen if one of them kills Bronn, but Bronn only says that man will be one Tyrion wants to hire. Tyrion asks Bronn if he would kill an infant girl without question when commanded. Bronn replies, \xe2\x80\x9cWithout question? No. I\xe2\x80\x99d ask how much.\xe2\x80\x9d Tyrion remarks to himself that he does not need Slynt or Deem, since he has a hundred such men of his own. He wants to laugh or cry, but most of all he wants Shae.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n\n==External Links==\n* [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2011/05/re-read-tyrion-ii-drunk-slynt-vs.html  Analysis and review of the chapter in the course of a 10th reread of the books] by Slynt.\n* [http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2010/03/tyrion-arya.html Humorous review of the chapter] by Jason.\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/01/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-4 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 08]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Tyrion Lannister]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 8]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 09, Tyrion]]\n[[zh:&amp;#21015;&amp;#29579;&amp;#30340;&amp;#32439;&amp;#20105;-&amp;#31456;&amp;#33410; 8]]</text>\n      <sha1>h1hgyon02lwio3kb3594sdir0k204sl</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>Barristan I (The Winds of Winter)</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>16879</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>198063</id>\n      <parentid>192144</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2017-03-26T20:12:04Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Casmir</username>\n        <id>6441</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <minor/>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5749">{{Warning|This information has thus far been released in a sample chapter for \'\'[[The Winds of Winter]]\'\', and might therefore not be in finalized form.

[[Barristan Selmy|Barristan]] rides through the western market square, remembering the time [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] [[siege of Meereen|took Meereen]]. The market has again become a scene of carnage, this time from the [[pale mare]].\n\nHe ride Daenerys\'s [[silver]], hoping that the horse\'s presence will inspire the warriors of Meereen to be brave, since Daenerys is gone. In addition, Barristan knows the horse has grown used to the presence of her [[dragon]]s, who are now loose in the city. [[Tumco Lho]], [[Larraq the Lash]], and the [[Red Lamb]] ride with Selmy, carrying the banners of the [[Kingsguard]] and [[House Targaryen]] and a warhorn to sound the commands. The [[Stormcrows]] and five thousand [[Unsullied]] have gathered as well. Even the last few [[Dothraki]] who remain in Meereen have come to fight, and Barristan is surprised to see many [[pit fighters]] have gathered at the market square as well. They have always loved [[Hizdahr zo Loraq]] more than Daenerys, yet it seems that freedom means something to them after all. \n\nThe Brazen Beasts man the city walls to free up as many Unsullied as possible. Barristan reflects that if they lose the battle, it will be [[Skahaz mo Kandaq]] and his men who will have to hold Meereen against Yunkai until Daenerys\'s return. At every gate a force has gathered, the [[Stalwart Shields]] at the eastern gate, the [[Mother\'s Men]] at the south gate, and the [[Free Brothers]] and [[Symon Stripeback]] at the north gate. Barristan is certain that the Yunkai\'i have more men than they do, and he feels that this attack he is planning goes against his instincts. Barristan\'s plans hinge upon the greed of the [[Tattered Prince]].\n\nBarristan gives a speech to the men assembled at the eastern market square. He repeats their plans for all to hear, and reflects that if he falls, [[Jokin]] will have the command, and [[Grey Worm]] after him. The realization that some of the men fear the pale mare more than they fear the enemy makes Barristan speak once more to his squires, about how every warrior is afraid before battle. He admits they are too few to win the battle, and their goal is to create chaos so the Unsullied will have enough time to form a spear wall. He is interrupted when the harpy on top of Meereen\'s [[Great Pyramid]] takes fire, their signal. The portcullis goes up, and Barristan dons his helm, ready for [[second siege of Meereen|the battle]].\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n{{Columns|2|\n*[[Barristan Selmy]]\n*[[The silver]]\n*[[Tumco Lho]]\n*[[Larraq]]\n*The [[Red Lamb]]\n*[[Unsullied]]\n*[[Grey Worm]]\n*[[Stormcrows]]\n*[[Jokin]]\n*The [[Widower]]\n*[[Rommo]]\n*The [[Spotted Cat]]\n*[[Fearless Ithoke]]\n*[[Senaera|Senaera She-Snake]]\n*[[Camarron of the Count]]\n*The [[Brindled Butcher]]\n*[[Togosh]]\n*[[Marrigo]]\n*[[Orlos|Orlos the Catamite]]\n*[[Goghor the Giant]]\n*[[Brazen Beasts]]\n*[[Sure Spear]]\n*[[Dogkiller]]\n}}\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n{{Columns|2|\n*[[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n*[[Drogo]]\n*[[Balerion|the]] [[Viserion|queen\'s]] [[Rhaegal|dragons]]\n*[[Aggo]]\n*[[Rakharo]]\n*[[Hizdahr zo Loraq]]\n*[[Khrazz]]\n*[[The Shavepate]]\n*[[Tal Toraq]]\n*[[Stalwart Shields]]\n*[[Marselen]]\n*[[Mother\'s Men]]\n*[[Free Brothers]]\n*[[Symon Stripeback]]\n*[[Company of the Cat]]\n*The [[White Bull]]\n*The [[Tattered Prince]]\n*[[Daario Naharis]]\n}}\n|}\n\n==Places and Terms Mentioned==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n{{Columns|2|\n*[[Meereen]]\n*[[Slaver\'s Bay]]\n*[[Skahazadhan]]\n*[[Yunkai]]\n*[[Slave Exchange]]\n*[[Great Pyramid]]\n*[[Spire of Skulls]]\n*[[Khyzai gate]] (also eastern gate or hill gate)\n*[[Lhazar]]\n*[[Khyzai Pass]]\n*[[Yellow gate]]\n*[[North gate]]\n*[[Tolos]]\n*[[Elyria]]\n*[[Basilisk Isles]]\n*[[Dorne]]\n}}\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Second siege of Meereen]]\n*[[Joso\'s Cock]]\n*[[Six sisters]]\n*[[Great Masters]]\n*Slave soldiers\n*[[Siege of Meereen]]\n*[[Pale mare]]\n*[[Khal]]\n*[[Dragons]]\n*[[House Targaryen]]\n*[[Kingsguard]]\n*[[squire]]\n*[[knight]]\n*hour of the wolf\n*[[Eunuch]]\n*Horselords\n*\'\'[[khalasar]]\'\'\n*\'\'[[Jaqqa rhan]]\'\'\n*[[Chainmaker]]\n*[[Pit fighters]]\n*[[Ghiscari legions]]\n*[[Wise Masters]]\n*[[Pit fighters]]\n*[[Tolosi slingers]]\n*[[Septons]]\n*[[The Seven]]\n*[[Crone (the Seven)|The Crone]]\n*[[Warrior (the Seven)|The Warrior]]\n*[[Mother (the Seven)|The Mother]]\n*[[Stranger (the Seven)|The Stranger]]\n*[[Great Shepherd]]\n}}\n|}\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|The Winds of Winter: Chapter ?]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Barristan Selmy]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Meereen]]\n[[es:Vientos de Invierno-Barristan I]]\n[[fr:The Winds of Winter, Chapitre provisoire, Barristan 1]]</text>\n      <sha1>dyp5w4jfmqc72lvbg1435maz51lwmsk</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Game of Thrones-Chapter 72</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6038</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>195717</id>\n      <parentid>166014</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-11-20T22:40:53Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Melanie</username>\n        <id>1443</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8144">{{Infobox Chapter AGoT\n| pov\t\t= [[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n| place         = [[Dothraki Sea]]\n| title\t\t= Daenerys X\n| page\t\t= 667\n| previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 71|Catelyn XI]]\n| current\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 72|Daenerys X]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Appendix|Appendix]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 68|Daenerys IX]]\n| arc next\t=\n}} __NOTOC__\n\n[[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] builds a funeral pyre for [[Drogo]] and places her dragon eggs among his treasures. When she attempts to take control of the few remaining [[Dothraki]] as a \'\'[[khal]]\'\' would, she is refused. As night falls, Daenerys lights the pyre and is drawn by instinct deep into the inferno. When the pyre dies, the others find her unburnt and nursing the first three baby [[dragon]]s in hundreds of years.\n\n==Synopsis==    \n\n[[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] and her \'\'[[khas]]\'\' build a funeral pyre for [[Khal]] [[Drogo]], as is [[Dothraki]] custom. There is little wood in the land so much of what they find is gnarled. They lay the logs in a square and fill the center with brush, grass, and bark shavings. [[Aggo]] and [[Rakharo]] kill a stallion from their now meager herd so that Drogo might have a mount in the afterlife; it is nowhere near as fine as Drogo\xe2\x80\x99s [[The Red|red]], but there are few in the world that are. [[Mirri Maz Duur]] believes that Daenerys is attempting to use bloodmagic to resurrect her \'\'khal\'\' and insists that without the proper spells the blood is nothing. The \'\'[[maegi]]\'\' even goes so far as to offer assistance in exchange for being released from her bonds, but Daenerys orders her silenced. On the platform they pile Drogo\'s treasures, but Daenerys does not let the weapons she received as bride gifts be added, insisting they are hers.\n\nSer [[Jorah Mormont|Jorah]] is wary of her intentions, and pleads with her to let Drogo go and come with him to see the wonders of the east. Daenerys assures him that she does not plan to sacrifice herself on her husband\xe2\x80\x99s pyre. When Ser Jorah calls her \xe2\x80\x9cprincess\xe2\x80\x9d, Daenerys insists that he call her \xe2\x80\x9cqueen\xe2\x80\x9d; her brother, the king, is dead and everything that was his is now hers.\n\nOnce the pyre is completed, Daenerys gathers her people together, now fewer than a hundred, and declares that they will be her \'\'[[khalasar]]\'\'. Among the crowd, she sees slaves and declares them free. She announces that any among them are free to go, but that if they stay they shall always have an honored place among her \'\'khalasar\'\'. \n\nDaenerys turns to the three young warriors of her \'\'khas\'\' and gives each of them one of her bride gifts, naming them \'\'[[ko]]\'\' and asking for their oaths as her [[bloodrider]]s: to [[Jhogo]] she gives the silver-handled whip, to Aggo the double-curved black dragonbone bow, and to Rakharo the gold-chased [[arakh]]. However, none of them are willing to take the oath: Jhogo replies that this is not done and it would shame him to be a woman\'s bloodrider, Aggo states that only a man can lead a \'\'khalasar\'\' and name a \'\'ko\'\', and Rakharo only promises to take her to [[Vaes Dothrak]] to join the \'\'[[dosh khaleen]]\'\'. Daenerys ignores the refusals. Finally, Daenerys turns to Ser Jorah and promises him a fine [[Valyrian steel]] blade when she comes into her [[Seven Kingdoms|birthright]]. Ser Jorah swears his fealty and heart to her and Daenerys proclaims him the first of her [[Queensguard]].\n\nDaenerys returns to her tent, knowing the Dothraki think her mad and not sure that they are wrong. After a pleasingly steaming hot bath, she is dried and perfumed. Daenerys sends her handmaids away so that she might prepare Drogo for his final journey. She thinks about how few Dothraki men die with their hair uncut as she washes him, braids his hair with bells, and dresses him in fine clothes and the worn vest he liked most. She finally asks him to forgive her, and declares that she paid the price, but it was too high. She then dresses in fine clothes with a vest like Drogo\xe2\x80\x99s. The sun is setting when she calls them back to bear Drogo to the pyre. \n\n[[File:Fire and bloodKerry BarnettII.png|thumb|280px|right|Daenerys enters the pyre \xe2\x80\x93 by Kerry Barnett \xc2\xa9 Fantasy Flight Games]]\n\nDaenerys orders oil poured over the pyre, and then orders her handmaidens to fetch her dragon eggs. Something in her voice makes them run. Ser Jorah protests that Drogo will have no need of dragon eggs, urging Daenerys to sell them and live as a wealthy woman for the rest of her days. Daenerys insists that the eggs were not given to her to sell. Daenerys climbs the pyre to place the black egg under Drogo\'s arm, near his heart, the green beside his head, and the cream-and-gold between his legs. Once the eggs are in place, Daenerys gives her love one last kiss. Climbing down, Daenerys notices Mirri Maz Duur watching her and hears the \'\'maegi\'\' call her mad. Daenerys only asks how far madness is from wisdom and commands that Mirri Maz Duur be bound to the funeral pyre by Rakharo and Ser Jorah, who hesitates and protests. The woman does not scream or plead as she is bound. As she pours the oil over the \'\'maegi\'\'\xe2\x80\x99s head, Daenerys thanks her for all she has taught her. Mirri Maz Duur promises that Daenerys will not hear her scream. Daenerys insists that she will, but that she only wants the \'\'maegi\'\'\xe2\x80\x99s life, echoing the woman\xe2\x80\x99s own words: \xe2\x80\x9cOnly death can pay for life.\xe2\x80\x9d This brings a flicker of what might be fear to \'\'maegi\'\'\xe2\x80\x99s face for the first time.\n\n[[File:MKomarck DaenerysTheUnburnt.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Daenerys the Unburnt, Mother of Dragons \xe2\x80\x93 by Michael Komarck\xc2\xa9]]\n\nThey wait for night to fall. It is Jhogo that first notices the [[red comet]], the first star of the evening. Daenerys sees this as a sign to light the pyre. Mirri Maz Duur sings in a high, ululating voice at first, but her voice becomes a wail as the flames engulf her and she soon falls silent. The Dothraki and Ser Jorah back away as the smoke grows thicker and the heat stronger, but Daenerys stands her ground; she is the blood of the dragon and undeterred by the fire. She knew the truth long ago, but the brazier was not hot enough. Then Daenerys begins to slowly walk towards the fire as sweat covers her body. She sees many images as she walks: trees, animals, and a great grey stallion. Seeing the horse she tells Drogo to mount, and for a second she sees him mounted. He smiles at her and cracks a whip made of flame down upon the pyre and Daenerys hears the crack of breaking stone as the pyre collapses, showering her with ash, cinders, and broken egg shell. Behind her, she can hear the Dothraki and Ser Jorah shouting. As the pyre begins to collapse completely, Daenerys hears two more cracks like the first and walks into the heart of the fire. \n\nWhen the fire dies, Ser Jorah finds Daenerys, naked but alive and unburnt except for her hair, nursing two baby [[dragon]]s, with a third draped across her shoulders. The dragons match the colors of their eggs: [[Viserion|cream-and-gold]], [[Rhaegal|green-and-bronze]], and [[Drogon|black-and-scarlet]]. Ser Jorah drops to his knees wordlessly. He is followed by Jhogo, Aggo, and Rakharo who declare her blood of their blood, and then her handmaidens and the rest of the Dothraki do the same. Daenerys knows that they are now hers as they never were Drogo\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\nDaenerys rises and for the first time in hundreds of years, the night comes alive with the music of dragons.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/12/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-34 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2009/09/catelyn-daenerys.html Humorous review of the chapter] by Jason.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/073/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 72]]    \n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Daenerys Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in the Dothraki Sea]]\n\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 73, Daenerys]][[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\x94\xd1\x8d\xd0\xb9\xd0\xbd\xd0\xb5\xd1\x80\xd0\xb8\xd1\x81 X]]</text>\n      <sha1>20v24amh0t5w4d2ew5kwjcnglny5imq</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 27</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6851</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>198709</id>\n      <parentid>166564</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2017-04-12T18:57:21Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Nittanian</username>\n        <id>3504</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4400">{{Infobox Chapter ADwD\n| pov\t\t= [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n| place         = [[Volantis]]\n| title\t\t= Tyrion VII\n| page\t\t= 351\n| previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 26|The Wayward Bride]]\n| current\t= Tyrion VII\n| next\t\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 28|Jon VI]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 22|Tyrion VI]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 33|Tyrion VIII]]\n}}\n\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:Futile GesturesLukasz Jaskolski.jpg|Tyrion, chained to the wall for the night. \xc2\xa9 FFG|thumb|350px|left]]\n[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] and his captor arrive at [[Volantis]], where Tyrion is put in chains so he will be taken for a [[slave]] and thus no one will listen to or help him. Tyrion tells his captor he knows that he is Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] and that Jorah has been working for [[Varys]]. Tyrion further explains that he is also on a mission from Varys, thus making them allies, but Jorah is unmoved by his argument. \n\nJorah takes a room in the [[Merchant\'s House]], chaining Tyrion to the wall for the night. The next day, they hear that the [[Golden Company]] (which Tyrion knows was hired by [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaegar)|Aegon Targaryen]] and [[Jon Connington]]) is headed west, putting an end to Tyrion\'s hopes of being rescued by them in Volantis.\n\nIn the morning they head into the dining hall of the Merchant\'s House, where Tyrion sees another [[dwarf]] and notices that he has been recognized. He tells Jorah, who is not concerned. Tyrion later reflects that this other dwarf seems somehow familiar. They then talk to the [[widow of the waterfront]], a former slave and now the powerful widow of a [[triarch of Volantis]], who is sympathetic with [[Daenerys Targaryen]]\'s actions. Jorah tells her that he needs to book swift passage to [[Meereen]] and Daenaerys. She asks Jorah why he seeks Daenerys and he answers, &quot;To serve her. Defend her. Die for her, if need be.&quot; The widow does not trust his motives, however.\n\nSuddenly, a chaotic fight breaks out. Tyrion is attacked by the knife-wielding dwarf, but Jorah effortlessly rescues him. Tyrion realizes this dwarf is a girl, and upon questioning her, they learn that the she is [[Penny]], one of the tilting dwarfs from [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]]\'s [[Purple Wedding|royal wedding]]. Her brother, also a dwarf, was mistaken for Tyrion and beheaded by sailors, but she was set free when they realized she was a girl.\n\nThe widow instructs Tyrion to take the \'\'[[Selaesori Qhoran]]\'\', a trading [[Ships|cog]] which is destined to [[Qarth]] by way of [[New Ghis]], but Benerro has foretold that it will not reach this destination. She gives him a message to deliver to Daenerys from the slaves of Old Volantis: &quot;Tell her we are waiting. Tell her to come soon.&quot;\n\n==Character list==\n\n{{columns|5|\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Jorah Mormont]]\n*[[Benerro]]\n*[[widow of the waterfront]]\n\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Cersei Lannister]]\n*[[Myrcella Baratheon]]\n*[[Haldon]]\n*[[Young Griff]]\n*[[Griff]]\n*[[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n*[[Malaquo]]\n*[[Rolly Duckfield]]\n*[[Varys]]\n*[[Jaime Lannister]]\n*[[Lysa Arryn]]\n*[[Methyso]]\n*[[Alios]]\n*[[Aerys II Targaryen]]\n*[[Tywin Lannister]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n*[[Lynesse]]\n*[[Shae]]\n*[[Tysha]]\n*[[Illyrio Mopatis]]\n*[[Vogarro]]\n*[[Doniphos]]\n*[[Nyessos]]\n*[[Parquello]]\n*[[Belicho]]\n*[[Trianna]]\n*[[Old Blood]]\n*[[R\'hllor]]\n\n}}\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{columns|7|\n*[[Volantis]]\n*[[Westeros]]\n*[[Andal]]\n*[[House Lannister]]\n*[[cyvasse]]\n*[[Rhoyne]]\n*[[Old Volantis]]\n*[[Valyria]]\n*[[Summer Sea]]\n*[[Free Cities]]\n*[[Selhorys]]\n*[[Lannisport]]\n*[[Black Wall]]\n*[[Long Bridge]]\n*[[High Priest]]\n*[[Great Sept of Baelor]]\n*[[Temple of the Lord of Light]]\n*[[Aegon\'s High Hill]]\n*[[Fiery Hand]]\n*[[Red Keep]]\n*[[King\'s Landing]]\n*[[Blackwater Rush]]\n*[[Fishmonger\'s Square]]\n*[[Merchant\'s House]]\n*[[Shy Maid]]\n*[[Eyrie]]\n*[[King\'s Hand]]\n*[[Seven Kingdoms]]\n*[[narrow sea]]\n*[[Lys]]\n*[[Braavos]]\n*[[House Lannister]]\n*[[Tyroshi]]\n*[[Golden Company]]\n*[[Volon Therys]]\n*[[Casterly Rock]]\n*[[Slaver\'s Bay]]\n*[[Yunkai]]\n*[[Common Tongue]]\n*[[Meereen]]\n*[[Stepstones]]\n*[[New Ghis]]\n*[[Tolos]]\n*[[Qarth]]\n}}\n\n\n[[Category:A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 27]]\n[[Category:A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Tyrion Lannister]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Volantis]]\n\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 27]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 28, Tyrion]]</text>\n      <sha1>6163vgphn8jd1j1ryltb37ugma26bwt</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 44</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5805</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>165809</id>\n      <parentid>161119</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-13T19:38:33Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Frernok</username>\n        <id>5007</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <comment>/*References and Notes*/</comment>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3994">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]\n| title\t\t= Jaime VI\n| place         = [[Harrenhal]]\n| page\t\t= 500\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 43|Arya VIII]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 44|Jaime VI]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 45|Catelyn V]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 37|Jaime V]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 62|Jaime VII]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:Mustamirri_I_only_rescue_maidens.jpg\xe2\x80\x8e\xe2\x80\x8e\xe2\x80\x8e|I only rescue maidens - by mustamirri \xc2\xa9|left|thumb|200px]]\n[[Roose Bolton]] has left [[Harrenhal]] to the [[Vargo Hoat|Goat]], but before marching for [[the Twins]] he told [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] to give his warm regards to [[Tywin Lannister|his father]].

Having found few leads in [[King\'s Landing]], Brienne is asking nearly everyone she can along the roads and villages, but never mentions Sansa by name. Upon [[Rosby road|the road]] beyond [[Rosby]], she comes upon a camp with two hedge knights who offer to share their meal. Mistaking her at first for a man, Ser [[Illifer]] later remarks on how she bears a shield with the sigil of [[House Lothston]], a disgraced family who once held [[Harrenhal]]. Brienne was given the shield by Ser Jaime, who had taken it from Harrenhal. When she tells the two that she lost her own shield, Ser Illifer figures out by her size that she must be Brienne, murderess of King [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]]. The Maid denies having killed Renly, and the hedge knights agree to travel with her to Duskendale.\n\nAfter passing a large group of poor fellows (or \'[[sparrows]]\'), lowly holy men bound for King\'s Landing bearing the bones of septons killed around the Riverlands, they catch up to a merchant guarded by a couple of men and another hedge knight named Ser [[Shadrich]]. Joining forces along the dangerous road, Ser Shadrich tells Brienne in private that he knows that the maid she seeks is Sansa Stark, and that he seeks her as well, but for a purse of gold offered by [[Varys]]. Brienne is disturbed by the fact that the knight knew whom she was speaking of when she repeated Sansa\'s description to the merchant\'s group. When the party stops at an inn for the night, Brienne slips off on her own, swearing to herself that she will not fail Jaime, having already failed King Renly and Lady [[Catelyn Tully|Catelyn]].\n\n==References and Notes==\n*The synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/02/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-feast-for-crows-part-3 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Feast for Crows, Part 3].

When he wakes he finds King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] angry about the abduction of [[Tyrion Lannister]], demanding that Ned make peace with the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]]. Robert reinstates Ned as [[Hand of the King]] and declares that Ned must sit the [[Iron Throne]] because he is going hunting.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\nUnder the influence of the [[milk of the poppy]], [[Eddard Stark|Ned]] dreams an old dream of the [[Showdown at the Tower of Joy|showdown]] at the [[Tower of Joy]]. In the dream as it was in life, his friends ride with him: [[Howland Reed]], Lord [[Willam Dustin]], [[Ethan Glover]], [[Martyn Cassel]], [[Theo Wull]], and Ser [[Mark Ryswell]]. They were seven facing three, but these three were men of the [[Kingsguard]] and living legends: [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard|Lord Commander]] Ser [[Gerold Hightower]], Ser [[Arthur Dayne]] the [[Sword of the Morning]], and Ser [[Oswell Whent]]. Ned had looked for them on the [[Battle of the Trident|Trident]], and at the [[Sack of King\'s Landing]], and at the [[Siege of Storm\'s End]], but found them guarding this tower near the [[Red Mountains]] of [[Dorne]]. In spite of Rhaegar\xe2\x80\x99s death, they refused to bend the knee. By the end, only Ned and Howland Reed remain alive. Ned is awoken from the dream in the midst of making a promise to his dying sister [[Lyanna Stark|Lyanna]] after the battle.\n\n[[Vayon Poole]] is calling and this wakes Ned. He is informed that it has been six days and King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] has commanded that Ned attend him when he wakes. Ned replies that he is too weak, but that he would be pleased to receive the king in his room. When Ned asks for his captain of the guard (remembering that [[Jory Cassel|Jory]] is dead), [[Alyn]] appears. He tells Ned that [[Jaime Lannister]] has left [[King\'s Landing]], that extra guards have been put on, that his daughters have been with him every day, and that Jory, [[Heward]], and [[Wyl (guard)|Wyl]] have been given to the [[silent sisters]] to be sent north to [[Winterfell]]. Ned remembers that Jory\xe2\x80\x99s father, Martyn Cassel\xe2\x80\x94who was one of his seven at the Tower of Joy\xe2\x80\x94was buried in the [[Dornish Marches]] with the others. That takes Ned back to his dream. He does not think it bodes well for him to dream that dream now. It is then that Poole announces the arrival of both Robert and [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]]. Ned does not think it bodes well that Cersei has come, either. Ned orders that they be sent in, and that the others leave, as what is to be said should be kept secret.\n\nWhen Robert asks if Ned knows what his wife has done, Ned states that [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] is blameless since she took action on his behalf and under his authority as [[Hand of the King]]. The king tells Ned he is unhappy: the King\xe2\x80\x99s Hand is supposed to keep the peace, but seven men are dead. Cersei corrects this to eight, as a Lannister [[Tregar|guardsman]] recently died of his wounds. Robert declares that he will not tolerate it and demands that Ned command [[Tyrion Lannister]]\xe2\x80\x99s release and make peace with Jaime. Ned angrily replies that three of his men were butchered in front of his eyes because Jaime wished to chastise him. \n\nCersei leaps to Jaime\xe2\x80\x99s defense, accusing Ned and his men of attacking Jaime while returning drunk from a brothel. Ned calmly reminds Robert that he should know him better than that, and that [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] will confirm his story. Robert replies that Littlefinger only said they had been returning from a brothel. Ned angrily informs Robert that he was at the brothel to visit Robert\xe2\x80\x99s [[Barra|bastard daughter]]. When Robert criticizes the girl\xe2\x80\x99s choice of name Ned has a hard time keeping his temper as he demands to know how one could expect a 15-year-old whore to have better sense. He then tells Robert that the girl is in love with him.\n\nNed asks for Robert\xe2\x80\x99s leave to bring Jaime back to face justice. Robert tells him to leave it alone and make peace with Jaime. Ned declares that if that is Robert\xe2\x80\x99s notion of justice he is pleased he is no longer his Hand. Cersei declares, &quot;If any man had dared speak to a [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] as he had spoken to you\xe2\x80\x94&quot; but Robert cuts her off by asking angrily if she mistook him for [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys]]. Cersei presses on regardless, telling Robert that she took him for a king, that Jaime and Tyrion are his brothers by marriage, and that Ned dishonors them all by driving off one brother and abducting the other. She steps too far, however, when she declares that Robert should be the one in skirts and her in armor. Robert\xe2\x80\x99s face goes purple with rage and he lashes out with a blow to Cersei\xe2\x80\x99s face that knocks her to the floor. Cersei remarks that she will wear the bruise as a badge of honor before she is escorted out by Ser [[Meryn Trant]].\n\nRobert, in misery, asks Ned if he sees what Cersei does to him. He continues that he should not have hit her, but says he does not know how to fight someone you cannot hit. Robert then declares that [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]] won: Rhaegar has Lyanna and he has Cersei. Ned tells Robert that they need to talk, but Robert is sick of talk and intends to hunt on the morrow; whatever Ned wants to tell him can wait until he returns. When Ned reminds Robert that by then he will have departed for [[Winterfell]] as commanded, Robert throws the [[Hand of the King|Hand]]\xe2\x80\x99s badge of office onto the bed and forbids Ned to leave. Ned asks about [[Daenerys Targaryen]] and is told that is done. Ned continues by asking why Robert wants him as Hand if he will not listen to his advice. Robert states that somebody has to run the kingdom. As he leaves, Robert swears that if Ned resigns again, he will pin the badge on Jaime Lannister.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/08/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-20 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/040/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==    \n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 39]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Eddard Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 39]]\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 40, Eddard]][[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\xad\xd0\xb4\xd0\xb4\xd0\xb0\xd1\x80\xd0\xb4 X]]</text>\n      <sha1>g6q09bnd884zrfhjyvi4x86qmypa26l</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 26</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6832</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166563</id>\n      <parentid>141528</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-25T15:37:17Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3953">{{Infobox Chapter ADwD\n| pov\t\t= [[Asha Greyjoy]]\n| place         = [[Deepwood Motte]]\n| title\t\t= The Wayward Bride\n| page\t\t= 332\n| previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 25|The Windblown]]\n| current\t= The Wayward Bride\n| next\t\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 27|Tyrion VII]]\n| arc previous\t= \n| arc next\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 42|The King\'s Prize]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:Marc Fishman AshaG.jpg| Asha interrogates a Flint man- by Marc Fishman \xc2\xa9 |thumb|300px|left]]\n[[Asha Greyjoy|Asha]] is at [[Deepwood Motte]] with her men, having fled the Iron Islands after the [[Kingsmoot]]. She receives news from [[Barrowton]] that [[Moat Cailin]] has fallen to [[Ramsay Bolton]].{{Ref|aDwD|20}} She thinks about a previous message from [[Stannis Baratheon]] asking for homage. Bolton\'s message is written in the blood of the Ironmen and comes with a piece of [[Theon Greyjoy]]\'s skin as a warning. &lt;ref&gt;[[Jon Snow]] receives what appears to be an identical message in [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 28|Chapter 28]], which would therefore appear to happen at almost the same time as this one. Both of them must therefore happen shortly after [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 20|Chapter 20]]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAt [[Ten Towers]], Asha received tidings that [[Euron Greyjoy|Euron]] had married her to [[Erik Ironmaker|Erik Anvilbreaker]], so she now lingers at Deepwood Motte, knowing that she cannot return to the Iron Islands without having to submit to her new husband. Asha takes note of the fact that Deepwood Motte is an old castle, yet not a strong one, as proven by her quick capture of it. She also tells herself that she will not be captured alive by the Boltons, and will fight to the death in any attempt of capture. She suspects that the next attack will come from the Boltons. Of the thirty longships that set out to capture Deepwood, only four remain with Asha and her followers council her to take flight. Asha refuses, stating that she will only fights, not run.\n\nAsha and [[Qarl the Maid]] have sex on [[Galbart Glover]]\'s bed and she reflects on their long relationship, regretting that they cannot marry, as Qarl is too low-born. During the night, the alarm is raised \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0it turns out that five Flint men from the mountain clans have tried to scale the wall. Asha\xe2\x80\x99s men defeat them quickly. A single survivor claims that they were alone, attempting to save [[Sybelle Locke|Lady Glover]]. But Asha\xe2\x80\x99s brutal interrogation reveals their true purpose: to open a gate for the three thousand men coming to take Deepwood Motte.\n\nAsha is unsure who is leading these men and she makes the sudden decision to try to flee for their ships instead, hoping that the northmen have not burned the beached ships she left behind. She is confident, however, since she always beaches half her ships and leaves the other half out at sea with orders to move to [[Sea Dragon Point]] if they are attacked.\n\nOn the way back to the ships, Asha realizes that it is dangerous to speed through the thick woods at night and they cannot light torches or else attract attention and an attack from the northmen. She decides to rest with her men and wait for sunrise in order to flee more quickly and safely. The northmen catch up to them, however, and a bloody, confusing battle ensues. Asha observes that the northmen are wearing shrubs and trees and thinks to herself that it is as if the very woods were attacking them. The battle continues with Asha fighting back to back with Qarl. Amidst the confusion, she loses him and is eventually hit in the head with an axe by a northman.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 26]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Asha Greyjoy]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Deepwood Motte]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in the Wolfswood]]\n\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 26]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 27, L\'\xc3\xa9pouse rebelle]]</text>\n      <sha1>2pcvhy854zeq1l292emon0u3v4njjqq</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 38</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6864</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>187051</id>\n      <parentid>182729</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-07-05T16:36:14Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Nittanian</username>\n        <id>3504</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4148">{{Infobox Chapter ADwD\n| pov\t\t= [[Areo Hotah]]\n| place         = [[Sunspear]]\n| title\t\t= The Watcher\n| page\t\t= 500\n| previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 37|The Prince of Winterfell]]\n| current\t= The Watcher\n| next\t\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 39|Jon VIII]]\n| arc previous\t= \n| arc next\t= \n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Balon Swann]] has arrived in [[Sunspear]],&lt;ref&gt;As foretold in \'\'[[A Feast for Crows]]\'\', [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 17|Chapter 17]] and [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 40|Chapter 40]]&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[skull of Gregor Clegane]]. He asks that [[Doran Martell]] takes his seat in the [[small council]], and that [[Myrcella Baratheon]] and [[Trystane Martell]] accompany them to [[King\'s Landing]]. His captain of the guard, [[Areo Hotah]], notes that many of the Dornish nobility present, including the bastard daughters of Prince [[Oberyn Martell]] do not join in the toast Prince Doran makes to King [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen I Baratheon]]. Hotah also notes that Balon would be more of a challenge to defeat than [[Arys Oakheart]] was.\n\nWhen the feast is done, Prince Doran summons his daughter, [[Arianne Martell|Arianne]], and the [[Sand Snakes]] to his solar and tells them that he has arranged that Myrcella will tell Balon that it was [[Gerold Dayne|Darkstar]] who injured her and killed Arys. Once that is done, [[Obara Sand]] is to lead Balon to Darkstar\'s lair at [[High Hermitage]] and destroy him. Doran also reveals to the Sand Snakes that sources loyal to him in King\'s Landing have told him the truth he was not meant to hear of this visit to the capital; Queen Regent [[Cersei Lannister]] plots to have Trystane killed on the way. An ambush is planned somewhere in the [[kingswood]], where their party will be attacked by outlaws and Trystane will be slain. Blame for the attack will be placed on the Imp, [[Tyrion Lannister]], as the outlaws will be crying &quot;Halfman!&quot; during their attack and Balon will claim to catch a glimpse of the Imp. The Sand Snakes are disbelieving, but Doran points out that knights of the [[Kingsguard]] are sworn to obey, regardless of their personal feelings on their orders, and points out that Balon argued against traveling by sea to return to King\'s Landing, as this would disturb the planned arrangements. Doran still does not want to defy the [[Iron Throne]] openly, so [[Nymeria Sand]] is to accompany Myrcella back to King\'s Landing and take the seat on the council, while [[Tyene Sand]] is also to travel to King\'s Landing, ordered to try and get close to the [[High Sparrow|new High Septon]] and thus give the Martells an ear amongst [[Faith of the Seven|the Faith]].\n\n\n{{Stub}}\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n* [[Areo Hotah]]\n* [[Balon Swann]]\n* [[Doran Martell]]\n* [[Myles]]\n* [[Caleotte]]\n* [[Arianne Martell]]\n* [[Ellaria Sand]]\n* [[Fowler Twins]]\n* [[Arys Oakheart]]\n* [[Obara Sand]]\n* [[Tyene Sand]]\n* [[Nymeria Sand]]\n* [[Gregor Clegane]]\n* [[Elia Martell]]\n* [[Ricasso]]\n* [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen I Baratheon]]\n* [[Arianne Martell]]\n* [[Lady Jordayne]]\n* [[Lord of Godsgrace]]\n* [[Deziel Dalt]]\n* [[Nymella Toland]]\n* [[Daemon Sand]]\n* [[Tremond Gargalen]]\n* [[Dagos Manwoody]]\n* [[Oberyn Martell]]\n* [[Myrcella]]\n* [[Trystane Martell]]\n* [[Cersei Lannister]]\n* [[Daenerys Targaryen (daughter of Aegon IV)]]\n* [[Daeron II Targaryen]]\n* [[Daemon I Blackfyre]]\n* [[Tywin Lannister]]\n* [[Robert I Baratheon]]\n* [[Amory Lorch]]\n* [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey I Baratheon]]\n* [[Rhaenys Targaryen (daughter of Rhaegar)|Rhaenys Targaryen]]\n* [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaegar)|Aegon Targaryen]]\n* [[Elia Sand]]\n* [[Obella Sand]]\n* [[Dorea Sand]]\n* [[Loreza Sand]]\n* [[Stannis]]\n* [[Gerold Dayne]]\n* [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys Targaryen (daughter of Aerys II)]]\n* [[Quentyn Martell]]\n}}\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 38]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Areo Hotah]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Dorne]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Sunspear]]\n\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 38]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 39, L\'observateur]]</text>\n      <sha1>ii6g4a42dbba7p4v54fwbz7ret4wf31</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Game of Thrones-Chapter 2</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>3391</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>183408</id>\n      <parentid>165948</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-04-28T19:10:29Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5372">{{Infobox Chapter AGoT\n| pov\t\t= [[Catelyn Tully]]\n| place         = [[Winterfell]]\n| title\t\t= Catelyn I\n| page\t\t= \n| previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 1|Bran I]]\n| current\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 2|Catelyn I]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 3|Daenerys I]]\n| arc previous\t= \n| arc next\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 6|Catelyn II]]\n}}\n\n[[Catelyn Tully|Catelyn]] informs her husband, Lord [[Eddard Stark]], that his foster father [[Jon Arryn]], the [[Hand of the King]], is dead and that King [[Robert Baratheon]] and his family are coming to [[Winterfell]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n[[File:Ned &amp; Ice.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Eddard Stark in the godswood]]\n\n[[Catelyn Stark]] seeks out her husband [[Eddard Stark|Eddard]] in the [[godswood]] following his return to [[Winterfell]]. She knows her husband always goes there after executing a man. She finds the godswood very dark and unsettling compared to the sunny one she remembers from her childhood home in [[Riverrun]]. Unlike her own [[House Tully|family]], the Starks keep faith with the [[old gods]], rather than the [[Faith of the Seven]].\n\nShe finds Ned polishing his ancestral greatsword, [[Ice]], under the [[heart tree]] at the center of the grove. He asks after the children, and Catelyn tells him they are deciding on the names for their new wolves. Ned notes that the [[Gared|man]] he excecuted is the fourth deserter this year. He adds that the man was half mad, that something had put a fear into him so deep that he could not reach him. The [[Night\'s Watch]] is dwindling, down to less than a thousand men, not just from desertions, but from ranging casualties. One day Ned may have to call his banners to fight [[Mance Rayder]] himself. Catelyn warns him that there are darker things beyond [[the Wall]]. Ned replies that the [[Others]] have been dead for eight thousand years, and that [[Maester]] [[Luwin]] claims they never existed at all. Catelyn replies that nobody had seen [[direwolf|direwolves]] until today.\n\nWhen Ned asks why Catelyn has come, she tells him that [[Jon Arryn]], his foster father and her brother-in-law, is dead. The news came in King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]]\'s own hand. When asked, Catelyn explains that Jon Arryn\'s widow--Catelynn\'s sister [[Lysa Arryn]]--and her [[Robert Arryn|son]] have returned to the [[Eyrie]] and says that she thinks her sister should not be alone and should have gone back to [[Riverrun]]. Ned urges Catelyn to take the children to keep her sister company, but then Catelyn informs him that [[Robert Baratheon]] has also written to say he is coming to [[Winterfell]]. This news gladdens Ned; it has been nine years since he last saw his old friend. However, Catelyn is worried about the omen of a [[House Stark|direwolf]] found dead in the snow with an [[House Baratheon|antler]] buried in its throat. \n\nWith Robert coming, Catelyn confirms with Ned that they should send word to his brother [[Benjen Stark|Benjen]] on [[the Wall]]. Then Catelyn informs Ned that Robert\'s wife [[Cersei Lannister]], their children, and her [[House Lannister|Lannister]] brothers are also coming. Ned does not like the Lannisters because they came to Robert\xe2\x80\x99s cause only after [[Sack of King\'s Landing|victory]] was certain.

After dismissing the officers, Lord [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] details their precarious position to [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] and dispatches him to [[King\'s Landing]] to serve as acting [[Hand of the King]] and keep [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] from ruining them all. In spite of his father\xe2\x80\x99s direct command, Tyrion intends to bring [[Shae]] with him.\n\n==Synopsis==    \nThe army has just returned to the [[inn at the crossroads]] when a messenger arrives with word of Ser [[Jaime Lannister]]\xe2\x80\x99s [[Battle in the Whispering Wood|capture]] and the [[Battle of the Camps|defeat]] of his army at [[Riverrun]]. Lord [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] is upset that the [[House Stark|Starks]] have his son. The news makes [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] think back on their grueling countermarch. After realizing that [[Robb Stark]] had split his forces, Lord Tywin set a grueling pace back toward the [[Trident]] in an attempt to reach Riverrun before the Starks. They left the bodies of the weak and the wounded in their wake every day and it was all for nothing; Robb Stark has beaten them there by many days.\n\nSer [[Harys Swyft]] bemoans Jaime\xe2\x80\x99s decision to split his army into three camps, but Ser [[Kevan Lannister]] explains calmly that Riverrun\xe2\x80\x99s position at the fork of the [[Tumblestone]] and the [[Red Fork]] forces any besieger to do just that, placing one army north of the Tumblestone, one south of the Red Fork, and one between the two rivers to the west. \n\nJaime\xe2\x80\x99s army had no warning. Few of their outriders returned and those who did had seen nothing. The blame for their disappearance fell on a small raiding force commanded by [[Marq Piper]] and Jaime rode out personally to deal with them in the Whispering Wood and did not return. Robb\xe2\x80\x99s force attacked the north camp first during the night. [[Brynden Tully|The Blackfish]] led the attack, cutting down the sentries. When Lord [[Andros Brax]] saw that the northern camp was under attack, he led the men of the western camp across the Tumblestone in rafts to join the battle. However, the current pushed them downstream into range of the catapults of Riverrun. Many of the rafts were sunk or overturned and Lord Brax was drowned by his heavy plate armor. Those few who reached the far bank found the enemy waiting for them. Ser [[Flement Brax]], Lord Brax\xe2\x80\x99s son, is disquieted to hear of the death of his father. \n\nThe camp between the rivers was overwhelmed as well. While Lord Brax was attempting to cross, two columns of armored horse swept in from the west led by Robb Stark himself with his [[Grey Wind|direwolf]] at his side. A few [[House Lannister|Lannister]] pikemen managed to hold against the first charge, but Lord [[Tytos Blackwood]] led a sortie from Riverrun to take them from the rear. [[Greatjon Umber]] fired the siege towers and Lord Blackwood liberated the prisoners, including Ser [[Edmure Tully]].\n\nThe south camp, under the command of Ser [[Forley Prester]], was able to retreat in good order back toward the [[Golden Tooth]] with 2,000 spears and as many bowmen, but the Tyroshi [[Mercenary|sellswords]] in his camp struck their banners and went over to the enemy. Kevan curses Jaime for not heeding his warning about mercenaries.\n\nSer Harys exclaims that all is lost. Jaime\xe2\x80\x99s host is all destroyed or put to flight and the Starks and [[House Tully|Tully]]s now stand astride their supply lines, cutting Lord Tywin\xe2\x80\x99s host off from their supplies and their [[westerlands|homeland]]. Robb Stark can even march on [[Casterly Rock]] if he wishes. Ser Harys insists that they must sue for peace. At that, Tyrion shatters his wine cup against a wall, declaring that Ser Harys will have better luck drinking from his broken cup than making peace with Robb Stark now that [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] has beheaded [[Eddard Stark]].\n\nSer [[Addam Marbrand]] insists that two battles do not make a war, while Lord [[Leo Lefford]] suggests a truce and an exchange of prisoners. Tyrion only scoffs that the Starks hold far more prisoners than they do and that Eddard Stark\xe2\x80\x99s head will not get his brother Jaime back; Robb is winning. When Lefford mentions that they hold Robb\xe2\x80\x99s sisters, Marbrand states that only an utter fool would exchange two girls for Jaime. Tyrion also shoots down Lefford\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion of a monetary ransom, declaring that the Starks can melt Jaime\xe2\x80\x99s armor if they need gold. Ser Harys then suggests that they get their friends in the court to join them and to raise a new host at Casterly Rock. Lord Tywin has been even quieter than usual. After reiterating that they have his son, Tywin orders everyone but Tyrion and Kevan out.\n\nTyrion is going to ask for wine but his father gives him his, untouched. Lord Tywin tells Tyrion that he was right about Eddard Stark: alive, Eddard could have been used to bargain a peace and buy time to deal with [[Robert Baratheon|Robert\xe2\x80\x99s]] brothers. Tywin states the execution was madness and rebuffs Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to excuse Joffrey for his youth, though at least Joffrey did not marry a [[Tysha|whore]]. \n\nLord Tywin explains that [[Varys]] has heard reports that [[Renly Baratheon]] has wed [[Margaery Tyrell]] and declared himself king, with all the might of [[Highgarden]] and [[Storm\'s End]] behind him. Lord Tywin also informs them that [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] has commanded him to march to defend [[King\'s Landing]]. Tyrion can tell that Tywin is not happy about being commanded. Cersei has not told Joffrey of Renly\xe2\x80\x99s claim, fearing her son will insist on leading the [[City Watch of King\'s Landing|City Watch]] against Renly and leave the city undefended against [[Stannis Baratheon]]. Lord Tywin admits that, from the beginning, he has considered Stannis the most dangerous, and yet the Lord of [[Dragonstone]] has done nothing; Varys has only heard whisperings that Stannis is building a fleet, hiring sellswords, and seeking the counsel of a [[Shadowbinder|shadowbinder]] from [[Asshai]].\n\n[[File:Tywin and Tyrion.png|thumb|400px|left|Lord Tywin and Tyrion discuss their options. ([[Game of Thrones|TV series]])]]\n\nTywin then details their position on a map. With Jaime\xe2\x80\x99s defeat, they are in a bad situation: [[Roose Bolton]]\xe2\x80\x99s remnants are to the north, enemies hold the [[Twins]] and [[Moat Cailin]], and Robb Stark is to the west so they cannot retreat to [[Lannisport]] without giving battle, while Jaime\xe2\x80\x99s army has ceased to exist and [[Beric Dondarrion]] and [[Thoros of Myr]] plague their foraging parties. Then there are Dragonstone, Storm\xe2\x80\x99s End, and Highgarden to the south calling their banners. Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s jest that at least [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] is still dead goes unappreciated. If they remain where they are they might get caught between three armies. Tywin explains that he plans to go to [[Harrenhal]] to confront Robb Stark. Ser [[Addam Marbrand]] will screen their movements, while [[Gregor Clegane]], [[Vargo Hoat]], and Ser [[Amory Lorch]] with 300 men each will set fire to the [[riverlands]] south of the Red Fork.\n\nOnce Ser Kevan leaves to issue the orders, Lord Tywin offers to let Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s [[Vale mountain clans|clansmen]] ride with Vargo Hoat, but Tyrion wishes to keep them close. Lord Tywin insists that Tyrion must learn to control them then, because he will not have King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing pillaged. Tyrion does not understand until his father explains that he is sending him to court to act as [[Hand of the King]] and clean up the mess Cersei and the [[small council]] have created. Lord Tywin goes on to rant about the raising of [[Janos Slynt]], the dishonoring of Ser [[Barristan Selmy]]--who lent honor to any man he served--and the appointment of [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]] to the [[Kingsguard]]. He also tasks Tyrion with bringing Joffrey under control if Cersei continues to fail and gives instructions to execute any councilors who play Tyrion false. When Tyrion asks why \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98he\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 is being sent, Tywin states it is because Tyrion is his son; Tyrion, however, thinks it is because Tywin has given up Jaime for lost. As he leaves, Tywin commands that Tyrion is not to take [[Shae|his whore]] to court.\n\nTyrion sits for a long while in the common room before going to his bed with Shae and whispering that he is of a mind to take her to King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/11/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-33 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2009/08/daenerys-tyrion.html Humorous review of the chapter]\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/070/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 69]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Tyrion Lannister]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Crossroads Inn]]\n\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 70, Tyrion]]\n[[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\xa2\xd0\xb8\xd1\x80\xd0\xb8\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbd IX]]</text>\n      <sha1>odwmwks0r4pvr98km6qg36l9fpj9bz8</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Clash of Kings-Chapter 44</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6212</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166447</id>\n      <parentid>109345</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-23T20:54:18Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4571">{{Infobox Chapter ACfK\n| pov\t\t= [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n| place         = [[King\'s Landing]]\n| title\t\t= Tyrion X\n| page\t\t= 464\n| previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 43|Jon V]]\n| current\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 44|Tyrion X]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 45|Catelyn VI]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 41|Tyrion IX]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 49|Tyrion XI]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] learns from [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]] that [[Cersei Lannister|the Queen]] intends to hide [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] away at [[Rosby]] under the care of Lord [[Gyles Rosby|Gyles]]. He is disturbed that [[Varys]] has not learned of this, or decided not to inform him. \n\nLater, Tyrion has [[Bronn]] deliver word to Ser [[Jacelyn Bywater]], commanding him to take fifty men and capture Lord Gyles\' party, and to expel the garrison and keep Tommen safe at Rosby. He does not want Lord Rosby hurt, nor any killing done in front of Tommen. For this, Ser Jacelyn will earn a lordship. Bronn offers to do the job instead if there\'s a lordship in it for him, but Tyrion refuses, privately noting that Bywater\'s men will defend Tommen whereas Bronn\'s are more likely to sell Tommen to the crown\'s enemies if the coming battle goes against them.\n\nTyrion then sets out for [[Chataya]]\xe2\x80\x99s, but then abandons his patience and rides directly to [[Shae]]\xe2\x80\x99s mansion. He finds her listening to [[Symon Silver Tongue|a singer]], and has the man expelled and sworn to silence. When one of the [[Begging Brothers|begging brothers]] appears, Shae recognizes him as Lord Varys. The Spider informs Tyrion that [[Storm\'s End]] has fallen and that [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] will soon be marching on [[King\'s Landing]]. Tyrion bids Varys to wait at the stables while he talks to Shae.\n\nOnce alone, Shae asks Tyrion to make her his lady in court, and even suggests he kill Cersei, but Tyrion tells her, \'\'&quot;The man who kills his own blood is cursed forever in the sight of gods and men.&quot;\'\' When Tyrion proposes to take her to the [[Red Keep]] and hide her in the kitchens, Shae balks, and mocks him for being afraid of [[Tywin Lannister|his father]]. Tyrion slaps her in the face, telling her never to mock him again. Feeling remorseful, he tells her the story of [[Tysha]] and his father\xe2\x80\x99s wrath. He departs to meet Varys at the stables, and the eunuch suggests that Shae be placed as a maidservant to Lady [[Tanda Stokeworth|Tanda]]\xe2\x80\x99s daughter [[Lollys Stokeworth|Lollys]]. Shae would then be able to access the [[Tower of the Hand]] through a secret passage, which Tyrion is surprised to learn exists. \n\nVarys then attempts to tell Tyrion how Ser [[Cortnay Penrose|Cortnay]] died, and when he suggests it was magic, Tyrion disbelieves him. Varys recounts the story of how he came to be a eunuch: that he was a member of a mummers\xe2\x80\x99 troupe, and that one day in [[Myr]] a certain man bought Varys from his master. The sorcerer castrated Varys, and burned the parts, creating a blue flame from which a voice spoke in a language he didn\xe2\x80\x99t comprehend. Varys claims he has hated magic since that day, and means to see Stannis dead if the man practiced magic. \n\nTyrion is somewhat skeptical, beliving it more likely that Stannis has hired a skilled assassin from the [[Free Cities]], musing on how he used to dream of being rich enough one day to hire a [[Faceless Men|Faceless Man]] to kill his sister. Tyrion\'s greater concern is that Stannis is now bringing his army to bear against King\'s Landing, and he is the only one standing in the way of Stannis\'s victory. With the city\'s people\'s hatred for [[House Lannister]] and himself in particular at its highest, defeating Stannis seems unlikely.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n* The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n* [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2012/01/re-read-tyrion-x-mansion-of-minstrels.html Summary and analyses of the chapter] in the course of a 10th reread by Slynt.\n* [http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/06/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-21 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 44]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Tyrion Lannister]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in King\'s Landing]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 44]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 45, Tyrion]]\n[[zh:\xe5\x88\x97\xe7\x8e\x8b\xe7\x9a\x84\xe7\xba\xb7\xe4\xba\x89-\xe7\xab\xa0\xe8\x8a\x82_44]]</text>\n      <sha1>avzec5dotltsf62s3evlgmzvq291nbj</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 51</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6888</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166589</id>\n      <parentid>165645</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-25T22:00:33Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4423">{{Infobox Chapter ADwD\n| pov\t\t= [[Theon Greyjoy]]\n| place         = [[Winterfell]]\n| title\t\t= Theon I\n| page\t\t= 673\n| previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 50|Daenerys VIII]]\n| current\t= Theon I\n| next\t\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 52|Daenerys XI]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 46|A Ghost in Winterfell]]\n| arc next\t= \n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Theon Greyjoy]] is with some of the [[spearwife|spearwives]], [[Rowan]] as well as [[Mance Rayder|Abel]]. He tells them that it is madness to try to escape as [[Ramsay Bolton]] will chase them and hunt them down with his dogs. Abel replies that [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] must be close by the sounds of the horns and it is unlikely Ramsay would ride out into that. Theon also begs that he not be allowed to fall back into Ramsay\'s hands alive, to which [[Squirrel]] replies &quot;Abel\'s word&quot;.\n\n[[Hosteen Frey]] barges into the halls, announcing that [[Walder Frey (son of Merrett)|Little Walder]], son of his brother [[Merrett Frey|Merrett]], has been killed. Theon looks at the spearwives but Rowan replies that this is no work of theirs. [[Walder Frey (son of Jammos)|Big Walder]] implicates the [[House Manderly|Manderly]] men, saying that the boy went out to get some silver owed to him. The dispute turns into a spar of words and when Lord [[Wyman Manderly]] insults both the dead boy and [[House Frey]] simultaneously, Hosteen draws his sword in a blind fury and attacks Manderly, who is sliced under his chins and collapses; his knights leap to defend him and a vicious and bloody fight breaks out. In the end, six [[White Harbor]] men lie dead, two [[House Frey|Frey]] men, as well as one of Ramsay\'s [[Bastard Boys]], [[Luton]]. Roose and Ramsay quell the tension by telling the men present if they want blood, they should turn their anger on Stannis. Hosteen replies that once they bring Roose Stannis\' head, they will come for Wyman\'s.\n\nRoose asks Abel to play them a song and the Freys leave. It is then that Rowan grasps Theon\'s arm, telling him that the time must be now and that Abel can fend for himself. The plan is to dress [[Jeyne Poole|the fake Arya]] up as Squirrel, while the real Squirrel climbs away down the wall. They find the girl in her room, where she is terrified to leave, thinking this is a trap set up by Ramsay. The girl tells the washerwomen that she has been trained, she won\'t escape, Ramsay does not need to chop off her feet. They finally get her into Squirrel\'s clothes, and Theon tells her to follow [[Holly]] closely, and not to run.\n\nAs they get to the gate they see some guards. Holly seduces one and kills him in the process while [[Frenya]] struggles and kills the other- Jeyne lets out a scream in the process, revealing them. Frenya waits at the bottom and fights the rest of the &quot;kneeler&quot;s that come to catch them, while Holly and the others get to the top of the wall. Holly then realizes that Frenya has the rope, just before being killed by arrows.\n\nTheon thinks that if they are caught now they will be brought to Ramsay and tortured. He then throws himself and Jeyne over the battlements.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n* [[Theon Greyjoy]]\n* [[Stannis Baratheon]]\n* [[Nan|Old Nan]]\n* &quot;Abel the Bard&quot; ([[Mance Rayder]]) \n* [[Rowan]]\n* [[Squirrel]]\n* [[Roose Bolton]]\n* [[Walda Frey (daughter of Merrett)]]\n* [[Hother Umber]]\n* [[Aenys Frey]]\n* [[Roger Ryswell]]\n* [[Wyman Manderly]]\n* [[Ondrew Locke]]\n* [[Ramsay Bolton]]\n* [[Ben Bones]]\n* [[Skinner]]\n* [[Damon Dance-for-Me]]\n* [[Harwood Stout]]\n* &quot;Arya Stark&quot; ([[Jeyne Poole]])\n* [[Eddard Stark]]\n* [[Hosteen Frey]]\n* [[Walder Frey (son of Jammos)]]\n* [[Merrett Frey]]\n* [[Walder Frey (son of Merrett)]]\n* [[Luton]]\n* [[Walton|Steelshanks Walton]]\n* [[Rhodry]]\n* [[Medrick]]\n* [[Yellow Dick]]\n* [[Balon Greyjoy]]\n* [[Myrtle]]\n* [[Willow Witch-eye]]\n* [[Frenya]]\n* [[Holly]]\n* [[Maisie]]\n* [[Jez (serving girl)|Jez]]\n* [[Robb Stark]]\n* [[Rodrik Cassel]]\n* [[Jory Cassel]]\n* [[Harwin]]\n* [[Hullen]]\n* [[Cayn]]\n* [[Desmond]]\n* [[Tomard]]\n* [[Alyn]]\n* [[Mikken]]\n* [[Sour Alyn]]\n* [[Grunt]]\n* [[Bran Stark]]\n* [[Rickon Stark]]\n* [[Jon Snow]]\n* [[Arya Stark]]\n}}\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 51]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Theon Greyjoy]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Winterfell]]\n\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 51]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 52, Theon]]</text>\n      <sha1>66u4ecm41bffbo9w7ge4hj8ccf4kf1h</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Feast for Crows-Prologue</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>3338</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>173800</id>\n      <parentid>159628</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-09-26T07:29:42Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6675">{{Infobox Chapter AFfC\n| pov\t\t= [[Pate (Novice)|Pate]]\n| title\t\t= Prologue\n| place         = [[Oldtown]]\n| page\t\t= 1\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Appendix|Appendix]]\n| current\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Prologue|Prologue]] \n| next\t\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 1|The Prophet]] \n| arc previous\t= \n| arc next\t= \n}}\n\nThe [[A Feast for Crows-Prologue|Prologue]] of \'\'[[A Feast for Crows]]\'\' is set in [[Oldtown]]. The characters are students of the [[Citadel]] of Oldtown. The [[POV Character|main character]] is Pate, an unsuccessful student.  \n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Pate (Novice)|Pate]] sits with his fellow students, [[Mollander]], [[Alleras]], [[Armen]], and [[Roone]], at the [[Quill and Tankard]] in [[Oldtown]]. He yearns for [[Rosey]], the pretty daughter of a serving maid, a fifteen-year-old girl whose maidenhead can only be had for a gold coin. The other students discuss [[dragon]]s, and whether there are still any in existence. Pate is waiting for an [[alchemist]] who has promised to meet him there that evening. The Alchemist has offered to change iron into gold, requesting that Pate steal a particular iron item in exchange for some gold, and said he would be back in three days to make the exchange.\n\nMollander and Armen continue their argument about dragons. Mollander says that sailors\' tales speak of dragons in far places, often accompanied by a young queen. Alleras keeps splitting thrown apples with his arrows. After the last, he brings up the [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]], telling the others that [[Viserys Targaryen]]\'s sister [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] is still alive. Mollander drunkenly toasts her, only to be shushed by Armen.\n\n[[Leo Tyrell|Lazy Leo]] appears then.  Mollander bristles at his appearance, Armen asking more diplomatically whether Leo wasn\'t confined to the [[Citadel]] for three more days, but Leo shrugs this off with a quip on the meaninglessness of time. He asks them to buy him a drink, since he lost his money gambling and eating elsewhere. He offends them each in turn, then attempts to mollify them by confirming that Daenerys is alive and has hatched three dragons, as the tales come out of [[Qarth]]. [[Maester#Archmaester|Archmaester]] [[Marwyn]] even gives them credence, Leo says. Marwyn, called &quot;The Mage&quot;, is widely considered unsound, partly because of his practice of speaking to smallfolk and other unwholesome people. After the others scoff, Leo adds that there is a [[dragonglass]] candle burning in Marwyn\'s chambers.\n\nThe group breaks up after that, most of the students returning to the Citadel. Pate remains with Leo, hoping that the alchemist will still come by. Leo needles Pate a few times about Rosey. Pate wishes he could kill Leo, but Leo is a [[House Tyrell|Tyrell]], with relatives in positions of power. He sees the sun rising, and realizes that the night is over and the alchemist has not come. He leaves, with a final warning to Leo to leave Rosey alone.\n\nPate wanders through Oldtown in the early morning. After nearly being run down by a cart, he sees the alchemist standing over him. He tells Pate that he didn\'t want to intrude on him and his friends. He has asked Pate to steal something from Archmaester [[Walgrave]]\'s quarters. Pate opened the box under Walgrave\'s bed, and found an Archmaester\'s iron key which supposedly opened every lock in the Citadel; after wrestling with his conscience, he took it, as well as a sack of silver coins.\n\nHe asks the Alchemist for his gold dragon coin, and the alchemist bids him follow him someplace more private. They go through several winding streets and end up in an alley. The Alchemist gives Pate the coin, but the boy hesitates before offering up the key. He asks the Alchemist\'s intentions, which he will not say, and asks to see his face, which is nondescript.&lt;ref&gt;But matches [[Jaqen H\'ghar]]\'s new face as described in [[A Clash of Kings]], [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 47|Chapter 47 (Arya IX)]]. The implication is that Jaqen is probably also the Alchemist and a [[Faceless Men|Faceless Man]].&lt;/ref&gt;  After giving the key to the Alchemist, he turns away, feeling light-headed, and collapses dead on the cobblestones a few moments later.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References}}\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/01/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-feast-for-crows-part-1 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Feast for Crows, Part 1].

Among the others wildlings come to the wall, nineteen are girls and women and were sent to [[Hardin\'s Tower]] to avoid trouble with the men in [[Castle Black]]. Their presence makes the men uneasy and there has already been an incident. The [[spearwife|spearwives]] know how to defend themselves and their girls, and three men had to be locked in ice cells.  \n\nJon means to garrison [[Deep Lake]], [[Sable Hall]] and [[Long Barrow]] with wildlings under command of offices of the Night\'s Watch, and to choose an almost completely female contingent for Long Barrow in order to avoid future harassment. [[Iron Emmett]] and [[Dolorous Edd]] will be Long Barrow\'s commander and chief steward.\n\nOther wildlings are also a cause of tension and incidents with the Brothers of the Night\'s Watch, most noticeably [[Halleck]] and his followers. Jon is also worried that the [[Thenn (people)|Thenns]] may blame him for the death of [[Styr]].\n\nTom Barleycorn finds a small group of wildlings, including a child and his mother, a Thenn, a [[Hornfoot]] and [[Wun Weg Wun Dar Wun|a giant]] in the weirwood grove. With the advantage of surprise and an effort at diplomacy from Leathers, they succeed in avoiding a fight and even convince the survivors to return to Castle Black with them.  \n\nThe recruits swear their vows in the presence of the wildlings. As he hears the verse about guarding \'\'the realms of men\'\', Jon realizes that his duties involve protecting the wildlings as well as any other men.\n\nThey return to Castle Black, bringing the two wildling corpses they found with them. Jon consigns the corpses to the ice cells and receives a letter from [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]], learning that he succeeded at [[Retaking of Deepwood Motte|taking Deepwood Motte]] and received support from various northern clans and houses along the way, including survivors from the [[battle at Winterfell]]. His troops now number five thousand and growing. Stannis has also learned that [[Ramsay Snow|Ramsay Bolton]] means to marry [[Arya Stark|Arya]]&lt;ref&gt;Actually [[Jeyne Poole]] pretending to be Arya as commanded by the Boltons and Lannisters, but Stannis and Jon are not among the few people who know that.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Winterfell]] and promises Jon to save her if he can. He means to have the help of [[Arnolf Karstark]] and [[Mors Umber]] at his attempt to conquer Winterfell.\n\nJon wonders if Arya could have escaped without Stannis\'s help, as predicted by [[Melisandre]].{{Ref|aDwD|28}} He also wonders if [[Roose Bolton]] could be lying about having Arya in order to bait Stannis and thinks about [[Mance Rayder]] and the six spearwives who went with him to rescue Arya.{{Ref|aDwD|31}}\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n* [[Jon Snow]]\n* [[Dolorous Edd]]\n* [[Iron Emmett]]\n* [[Old Nan]] \n* [[Ghost]]\n* [[Bowen Marsh]]\n* [[Satin]]\n* [[Arron]]\n* [[Emrick]] \n* [[Weeper|Weeping Man]]\n* [[Jack Bulwer|Black Jack Bulwer]] \n* [[Benjen Stark]]\n* [[Rory]]\n* [[Tom Barleycorn]]\n* [[Duncan Liddle |Duncan Liddle (Big Liddle)]] \n* [[Luke of Longtown]]\n* [[Hareth (Mole\'s Town)|Hareth the Horse]]\n* [[Leathers]] \n* [[Jax]]\n* [[Ygritte]]\n* [[Styr| Styr (Magnar of Thenn)]]\n* [[Sigorn | Sigorn  (Magnar of Thenn)]]\n* [[Halleck]]\n* [[Harma]]\n* [[Othell Yarwyck]]\n* [[Stannis]]\n* [[Pate (Night\'s Watch)]]\n* [[Mance Rayder]]\n* [[Melisandre]]\n* [[Eddard Stark]]\n* [[Arya Stark]]\n* [[Donal Noye]]\n* [[Mag Mar Tun Doh Weg | Mag the Mighty]] \n* [[Alysane Mormont]] \n* [[Roose Bolton]] \n* [[Arnolf Karstark]] \n* [[Mors Umber]]\n* [[Ramsay Snow]]\n* [[Robb Stark]]\n* [[Robert Baratheon]]\n* [[Daeron I Targaryen|Daeron I]]\n }}\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 35]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Jon Snow]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in the Haunted Forest]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Castle Black]]\n\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 35]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 36, Jon]]</text>\n      <sha1>tib3cwm31xilx7awz0ijqu4m2i7exmj</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Clash of Kings-Chapter 47</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6215</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>179188</id>\n      <parentid>166450</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-01-05T20:40:18Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Nittanian</username>\n        <id>3504</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5446">{{Infobox Chapter ACfK\n| pov\t\t= [[Arya Stark]]\n| place         = [[Harrenhal]]\n| title\t\t= Arya IX\n| page\t\t= 493\n| previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 46|Bran VI]]\n| current\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 47|Arya IX]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 48|Daenerys IV]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 38|Arya VIII]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 64|Arya X]]\n}}\n\nThe [[Brave Companions|Bloody Mummers]] bring 100 northmen to [[Harrenhal]] as prisoners.

Arya is forced to take on yet another pseudonym, Nan, and is named [[Roose Bolton]]\'s cupbearer.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Arya Stark|Arya]] and [[Hot Pie]] are eating tarts in the kitchens when the [[Brave Companions|Bloody Mummers]] return, this time with nearly 100 [[north]]men as prisoners, along with their lord commander, [[Robett Glover]], and [[Aenys Frey]]. [[Vargo Hoat]] claims that Lord [[Roose Bolton]] fled with his host after the battle. Ser [[Amory Lorch]] has the men imprisoned in the [[Widow\'s Tower]]. Arya tries to convince [[Gendry]] to help her free the northmen, but the apprentice smith is happy enough where he is and wants no part of it. Arya later goes to the [[godswood]] to practise with a wooden stick, and she meets [[Jaqen H\'ghar]] there. The [[Lorath]]i tells her he would have done with his promise, and asks her to name a third. He also knows her to be Arya Stark, and tells her that some people have many names. She asks him to help her free the northmen, but Jaqen reminds her that she has only one name left. When Arya asks if she could name anybody, even [[Joffrey Baratheon|the king]], Jaqen tells her, &quot;Speak the name, and death will come.

A man does not fly\xe2\x80\xa6but one foot moves and then another and one day a man is there, and a king dies.&quot; Arya whispers &quot;Jaqen H\xe2\x80\x99ghar&quot;, and stuns the man. But Jaqen is unafraid, and a dagger appears in his hand, telling her she would lose her only friend. Arya says that a friend would help her, and Jaqen agrees to help her if she names another name. They go and find [[Rorge]] and [[Biter]], and Jaqen tells her, &quot;The hungry gods will feast on blood tonight, if a man would do this thing&quot;, but Arya is resolute.\n\nJaqen brings Arya along, and has her demand several kettles of hot soup from the cooks. Each man takes one of the huge kettles, with Rorge carrying two, and they invade the tower where the prisoners are kept. Boiling soup flies everywhere as the guards are dispatched, and when Rorge unlocks the door to the cells, Robett Glover thanks them and asks if they are from the Brave Companions. Arya is confused, but has no time to ask him what he meant when fighting breaks out in the great castle. Jaqen wipes blood from his sword on Arya\xe2\x80\x99s shift, telling her this is her work. Later, Arya takes back the name, and asks if she still can name a third, but Jaqen responds that she has gotten far more than three deaths. As she watches, Jaqen tells her the debt is paid and that he must die, and his features change as he passes a hand over his face. Arya asks who he is and if she could learn to do the same, but Jaqen tells her she would need to go with him across the [[narrow sea]]. He leaves her with a coin, of great value in the right place, and tells her that if she ever needs to find him again, she should give the coin to any man from [[Braavos]], and say \'\'&quot;[[valar morghulis]]&quot;\'\'. Jaqen, who claims his name is as dead as Arry, then disappears into the night.\n\nLord Roose Bolton arrives in the aftermath of the [[fall of Harrenhal]], and Vargo Hoat turns the castle over to him. The prisoners were all a ruse to begin with, and apparently Bolton had bought the services of the Qohorik sellsword. As Roose Bolton takes control of the castle, [[Shagwell]] grabs Arya and presents her to her brother [[Robb Stark|Robb\'s]] bannerman as the weasel who made the soup. Bolton asks her name, and Arya tells him \xe2\x80\x98Nan\xe2\x80\x99. The Lord of the [[Dreadfort]] then asks if she is afraid of leeches, for he claims that a man must purge himself of bad blood. When Arya tells him she is not afraid, Bolton names her his cupbearer. The banners over the gatehouse are changed to the flayed man of the Dreadfort and the direwolf of the [[House Stark|Starks]]. Arya watches as the Bloody Mummers parade Ser Amory around naked, then feed him to a caged bear, and she thinks to herself, a bear all in black, like [[Yoren]].\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n\n* The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n* [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2012/01/re-read-arya-ix-diet-riot-and-pinch-of.html Analyses and summary of the chapter] in the course of a 10th reread by Slynt.\n* [http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/06/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-22 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 47]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Arya Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Harrenhal]]\n\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 47]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 48, Arya]]</text>\n      <sha1>epeiz8lf3zb0ka8v891a609yy8ghgmd</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Clash of Kings-Chapter 59</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6227</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166462</id>\n      <parentid>119501</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-23T20:59:11Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9882">{{Infobox Chapter ACfK\n| pov\t\t= [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n| place         = [[King\'s Landing]]\n| title\t\t= Tyrion XIII\n| page\t\t= 612\n| previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 58|Davos III]]\n| current\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 59|Tyrion XIII]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 60|Sansa VI]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 54|Tyrion XII]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 61|Tyrion XIV]]\n}}\n[[Tyrion Lannister]] watches as half of [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]\xe2\x80\x99 fleet is on fire in the [[Blackwater Rush]]. Hundreds of people are dying in the water. [[Joffrey Baratheon|King Joffrey]] complains that most of his ships are ablaze, but for Tyrion there is no alternative to sacrificing them. Some of Stannis\' ships have escaped, however, releasing men in front of the city wall or waiting on the southern shore of the Blackwater. Tyrion allows Joffrey to launch the [[Antler Men]] with the [[Three Whores|catapults]] into the fray. He gets word that there is a large force attempting to batter down the [[King\'s Gate]]. When he arrives there, he orders [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]], who is in command, to go out with his men, but Clegane refuses. Tyrion realizes that the man is afraid of the wildfire and he is forced to rally the troops himself, leading a sortie through the gate to stop Stannis\xe2\x80\x99 men.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Tyrion Lannister]], standing on top of the [[River Gate|Mud Gate]], watches motionlessly as half of [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis\']] fleet is ablaze in the [[Blackwater Rush]], along with most of [[Joffrey Baratheon|King Joffrey\'s]] ships. It seems like the river itself is on fire. The air is full of smoke, arrows and screams. The wildfire is drifting downstream towards ships that desperately, but futilely, try to escape. The low-hanging clouds reflect the green glow, creating an eerily beautiful scenery. Tyrion is reminded of dragon fire and wonders whether he feels the same way as [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] did when he watched the [[Field of Fire]]. He is captivated and can\'t turn away, although he realizes that this is only half a victory and that the celebrations of the [[City Watch of King\'s Landing|Gold Cloaks]] behind him are premature.\n\nTyrion sees another ship loaded with wildfire exploding and has to shield his eyes. Hundreds of people are dying in the water, either burning to death or drowning. He thinks of Stannis, who might be sitting on his warhorse among the mass of people on the southern bank of the Blackwater, watching the same spectacle. Tyrion hears King Joffrey, huddled among his guards on the wallwalk below, complaining about the fate of his fleet, as the \'\'[[Kingslander]]\'\', \'\'[[Queen Cersei]]\'\' and \'\'[[Loyal Man]]\'\' are already burning and the \'\'[[Seaflower]]\'\' is about to be engulfed by flames as well. He advises his nephew that there was no alternative to sacrificing the own fleet, thinking by himself that Stannis would have sensed the trap, if the royal fleet had not come forward for battle. [[Bronn]]\'s position under the [[Red Keep]] is too far away for Tyrion to see anything, but the sellsword must have set the oxen into motion the second Stannis\' flagship had passed and the enormously heavy chain was pulled up by the winches, creating a barrier that now prevents most ships from escaping the wildfire inferno. \n\nSome do, though, as Tyrion observes with dismay. While the main channel of the Blackwater is all aflame, the north and south banks are not, as the wildfire has not spread as evenly Tyrion hoped it would. A good part of Stannis\' ships have made for the southern side of the Blackwater, from where they can bring the enemy troops across later on, while at least eight ships have already landed under the city wall, putting men ashore there. Stannis\' main host might need some time to regain their courage after watching the jade holocaust that has absorbed so many of their fellows, but when they start to attack again, the risk of the city forces breaking will be acute, as Lord [[Jacelyn Bywater]] has warned Tyrion. Seeing shapes moving among the charred ruins of the city wharves, he sends order to Lord Jacelyn to make another sortie against soldiers stumbling ashore.\n\nHe also commands Ser [[Arneld]] to swing the [[Three Whores]] thirty degrees west. King Joffrey brings up that his mother has promised him that he could use the catapults and Tyrion allows him to go through with his plan for the [[Antler Men]]. When they were brought before the King for justice, Joffrey promised them that he would send them back to Stannis. The traitors are now naked and trussed up in the square, antlers nailed to their heads, and Joffrey intends to catapult the bodies over the city wall in Stannis\' direction. Tyrion tells Joffrey to proceed swiftly, as the Great Whores will be needed for other things soon. As the happy King is about to leave, escorted by members of the [[Kingsguard]], Tyrion orders Ser [[Osmund Kettleblack]] that they should keep Joffrey safe under any circumstance but also keep him among the defenders. He wonders whether [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] will be true to her promise of protecting [[Alayaya]] the way he protects Cersei\'s wretched bastard son.\n\nTyrion gets word that hundreds of enemies have landed on the tourney grounds and prepare for battering down the [[King\xe2\x80\x99s Gate]] with a ram. He curses, hurries to his horse and, followed by [[Podrick Payne]] and Ser [[Mandon Moore]], gallops through the [[King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing|River Row]], kept clear of traffic on Tyrion\'s command to allow movement between the gates, towards the King\xe2\x80\x99s Gate. When he arrives there, the ram is already in place outside and crashing against the wood. Some of the defenders on the gatehouse square are wounded, but Tyrion spots a good many sellswords and knights who are not, and he orders another sortie, asking who is in charge.\n\n[[Sandor Clegane]] steps forward and objects to Tyrion\'s order, dropping his helmet to the ground. His face is covered in blood from a gash on his forehead and his left ear is sheared off. Tyrion insists on a sortie, but the Hound tells him to bugger that and bugger himself. A sellsword seconds Clegane, explaining that three sorties left half of the men wounded or dead. Tyrion sarcastically asks him whether he thinks he has been hired to fight in a tourney. He repeats his order, addressing the Hound in particular, but then is shocked to notice that Clegane is actually scared. He changes his tactics and tries to coax the men into action, but Clegane is adamant that he will not lead the men into the fire again. He suggests to open the gate instead and kill the enemies when they rush inside. Ser Mandon advises him to obey the order of the [[Hand of the King]], but the Hound just curses Tyrion some more, then asks for wine.\n\nClegane\'s face is white as milk and Tyrion thinks he\'s dead on feet, worn out by the battle and his terror of fire. Even worse, the Hound\'s fear has shaken the will of those he commands. Tyrion is looking around for another man to put in charge, but dimisses his own idea of using Ser Mandon, as he remembers a comment by his brother [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] that Ser Mandon is not the kind of man others would follow. He hears another crash of the ram and announces that he will lead the sortie himself, thinking to himself that this is madness but madness is better than defeat. The Hound laughs at the suggestion with contempt, but Tyrion gives orders to prepare the attack. However, only twenty men respond to his call while the others follow Clegane\'s example. Sitting on his horse with helmet and shield, Tyrion addresses the holdouts: &quot;They say I\'m only half a man. What does that make the lot of you?&quot;\n\nHe manages to shame them by suggesting they are less than a dwarf if they refuse to fight the enemies. Within a few moments, twice as many men respond to Tyrion\'s orders. He announces:\n\n{{Quote|&quot;You won\xe2\x80\x99t hear me shout out Joffrey\xe2\x80\x99s name. [...] You won\xe2\x80\x99t hear me yell for [[Casterly Rock]] either. This is your city Stannis means to sack, and that\xe2\x80\x99s your gate he\xe2\x80\x99s bringing down. So come with me and kill the son of a bitch!&quot;}}\n\nTyrion unshields his axe and trots towards the sally point. He thinks the men are following him, but he doesn\'t dare to look around and check whether they really do.\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n*[[Meryn Trant]]\n*[[Osmund Kettleblack]]\n*[[Podrick Payne]]\n*[[Mandon Moore]]\n*[[Sandor Clegane]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Stannis Baratheon]]\n*[[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] \n*[[Aerys II Targaryen]]\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n*[[Tywin Lannister]]\n*[[Bronn]]\n*[[Hallyne]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Jacelyn Bywater]]\n*[[Arneld]]\n*[[Cersei Lannister]]\n*[[Alayaya]]\n*[[Jaime Lannister]]\n|}\n\n==Places mentioned==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n*[[River Gate|Mud Gate]]\n*[[Blackwater Rush]]\n*[[Red Keep]]\n*[[King\xe2\x80\x99s Gate]]\n*[[King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing|River Row]]\n*[[Casterly Rock]]\n|}\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n\n* The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n* [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2012/02/re-read-tyrion-xiii-lifes-spectator.html Analyses and summary of the chapter] in the course of a 10th reread by Slynt.\n* [http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/07/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-28 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 59]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Tyrion Lannister]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in King\'s Landing]]\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 59]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 60, Tyrion]]</text>\n      <sha1>c05tlc9f49mbd40ifdj1xuniwyjhilv</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 19</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5682</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>118331</id>\n      <parentid>99432</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2014-01-27T10:04:09Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>8dave</username>\n        <id>6535</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <minor/>\n      <comment>Typo.</comment>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8619">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]]\n| title\t\t= Tyrion III\n| place         = [[King\'s Landing]]\n| page\t\t= 209\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 18|Samwell I]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 19|Tyrion III]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 20|Catelyn III]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 12|Tyrion II]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 32|Tyrion IV]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n\nThe [[small council]] meets to discuss the progress of the war, and [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] learns that [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]] is still near death. [[Randyll Tarly]] [[Battle of Duskendale|defeated]] the northmen attacking [[Duskendale]], with [[Helman Tallhart]] reported dead, and [[Robett Glover]] fleeing west and being chased by [[Gregor Clegane]]. Tywin informs them that [[Daven Lannister]] is rounding up a new army and will join with men from the [[Golden Tooth]], and then march on [[Riverrun]] when [[Robb Stark]] returns north. They all agree that Robb will march for [[Moat Cailin]], for he is a king without a kingdom. \n\n[[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]] reveals that [[Balon Greyjoy]] has sent letters with terms of alliance. Greyjoy wants the [[North]], but Tywin says they will not treat with Balon while other options may present themselves. [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] agrees to go to the [[Eyrie]] to marry [[Lysa Arryn]], and once he is consort, deliver [[the Vale]] of Arryn into Tywin\'s hands. Since Littlefinger will be leaving within a day, Tyrion is named [[Master of Coin|master of coins]]. [[Pycelle]] informs them that 300 [[Dornishmen]] ride for [[King\'s Landing]] in response to Tyrion\'s negotiations, despite the hatred between [[Dorne]] and [[Highgarden]] that has gone on for hundreds of years. \n\n[[Mace Tyrell]] does not like the idea of Dornishmen riding across [[the Reach]]. Tyrion considers how the Lord of Highgarden talked like a general although he had never won a decisive battle. His victory over [[Robert Baratheon]] at [[Battle of Ashford|Ashford]] was won by Randyll Tarly and the [[Siege of Storm\'s End|siege of Storm\'s End]] lasted for a year without result until [[Eddard Stark]] relieved the castle.\n\n[[Garlan Tyrell]] has been named Lord of [[Brightwater Keep]] since [[Alester Florent]] is a traitor. [[Varys]] brings word of a three-headed dragon being born in [[Qarth]], and that the [[Night\'s Watch]] is begging for help against a [[wildling]] army. [[Tywin Lannister|Lord Tywin]] does not want to hear about rumors of dragons, and is disinterested in news of wildlings, claiming that if [[the Wall]] is overrun, the [[House Stark|Starks]] and [[House Greyjoy|Greyjoys]] will have a new enemy to deal with, even speculating they may be able to make a deal with [[Mance Rayder]], overriding the attempts of Varys and Tyrion to have gold cloaks who deserted during the [[Battle of the Blackwater]] forced to take the black. He adjourns the meeting, asking Tyrion, [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] and Kevan to stay. Tyrion warns them not to trust Littlefinger with this quest to the Vale, but Tywin is resolute, believing it better to have Baelish ruling the Vale as opposed to the likes of [[Yohn Royce]] or [[Lyn Corbray]] and adds that Littlefinger has proven his loyalty, telling Tyrion that just the other day Baelish informed them of a plot by the Tyrells to bring [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] to Highgarden and marry her to [[Willas Tyrell|Willas]]. The Hand is aware that should Mace Tyrell ask leave to bring Sansa to Highgarden, they must consent or else offend the Tyrells. Tywin wishes to circumvent this problem by offering Cersei\'s hand in marriage to Willas. Cersei adamantly refuses but her father has the final say, and Cersei storms out of the room in a fury. Tywin then tells Tyrion that he will wed Sansa Stark, further solidifying the Lannisters\'s position, because should [[Robb Stark|Robb]] die and Sansa and Tyrion have a son, the child will become Lord of [[Winterfell]]. \n\nTyrion protests, arguing that a marriage to Sansa is worthless while the Greyjoys hold the north and questions why he isn\'t being forced into a marriage with Balon\'s [[Asha Greyjoy|daughter]], but Tywin counters that the [[Ironborn|ironborn]] won\'t rule the north, they will just plunder it, uniting the northmen against them, which the Lannisters can use to retake the north when Tyrion brings Ned Stark\'s grandson home to claim his birthright. Tyrion argues again, protesting that Sansa is still a child, but Tywin retorts with Cersei\'s testimony the girl has flowered. Tyrion suggests sending the girl back to [[Catelyn Stark|her mother]] as a gesture of goodwill that might make Robb Stark bend the knee, but Tywin coldly retorts that if they do that, Sansa will be married off to one of the northern or Riverlords to shore up her brother\'s alliances. Tywin adds that this marriage is a reward for Tyrion\'s previous service and threatens that if Tyrion won\'t go through with it, they will marry Sansa off to Lancel or another of his cousins and find Tyrion another bride; the threat of being married to [[Lollys Stokeworth]], as well as the prospect of being made Lord of Winterfell if he is to be denied [[Casterly Rock]] is enough to cow Tyrion.\n\nAs a last attempt at protest, Tyrion argues that any claim Sansa might have to Winterfell will be made irrelevant when her brother gets a child from whichever Frey girl he marries, and learns to his surprise that Robb Stark has broken his pledge with the [[House Frey|Freys]] and married [[Jeyne Westerling]]. Ser Kevan reveals that [[Gawen Westerling|Lord Westerling]]\'s [[Sybell Spicer|wife]] is a Spicer, a house of extremely low birth having descended from traders. Tyrion is confused by the lack of fury in his father\'s eyes at this betrayal by the Westerlings, a house sworn to Casterly Rock. Lord Tywin states, &quot;Jeyne Westerling is her mother\'s daughter, and Robb Stark is [[Eddard Stark|his father]]\'s son.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jeyne\'s mother had wed a man of much higher birth than herself, and Robb married Jeyne after deflowering her because he was as honorable as his father.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Lancel Lannister]]\n*[[Randyll Tarly]] \n*[[Helman Tallhart]]\n*[[Robett Glover]]\n*[[Gregor Clegane]]\n*[[Daven Lannister]]\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Kevan Lannister]]\n*[[Balon Greyjoy]]\n*[[Petyr Baelish]] Littlefinger\n*[[Lysa Arryn]]\n*[[Pycelle]]\n*[[Mace Tyrell]]\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n*[[Garlan Tyrell]]\n*[[Alester Florent]]\n*[[Varys]]\n*[[Tywin Lannister]]\n*[[Mance Rayder]]\n*[[Cersei Lannister]]\n*[[Yohn Royce]]\n*[[Lyn Corbray]]\n*[[Sansa Stark]]\n*[[Willas Tyrell]]\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Asha Greyjoy]]\n*[[Catelyn Stark]]\n*[[Lollys Stokeworth]]\n*[[Jeyne Westerling]]\n*[[Gawen Westerling]]\n*[[Sybell Spicer]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n}}\t\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Small Council]]\n*[[Battle of Duskendale]]\n*[[Duskendale]]\n*[[Golden Tooth]]\n*[[Riverrun]]\n*[[Moat Cailin]]\n*[[North]]\n*[[Eyrie]]\n*[[The Vale]]\n*[[Master of Coin]]\n*[[Dornishmen]]\n*[[King\'s Landing]]\n*[[Dorne]]\n*[[Highgarden]]\n*[[The Reach]]\n*[[Battle of Ashford]]\n*[[Siege of Storm\'s End]]\n*[[Brightwater Keep]]\n*[[Qarth]]\n*[[Night\'s Watch]]\n*[[Wildling]]\n*[[The Wall]]\n*[[House Stark]]\n*[[House Greyjoy]]\n*[[Battle of the Blackwater]]\n*[[Winterfell]]\n*[[Ironborn]]\n*[[Casterly Rock]]\n*[[House Frey]]\n}}\n\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{references}}\n* The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n* [http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/12/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-11 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords part 11].

Less than an hour is left before the shows starts, and Mercy spends her time helping the other mummers with their costumes, sticking the horn back on the [[Stranger]], finding Izembaro\'s crown in the privy, finding needle and thread so the gown of the queen can be sewed back up, lacing up Bobono\'s fake cock, which is to be used for the raping scene, finding Izembaro\'s boar spear, helping Big Brusco into his boar costume, checking the knives used for the play, and pouring wine for [[Lady Stork]].\n\nBy then, the pit is already very full. The [[Harys Swyft|Westerosi envoy]] has arrived as well, accompanied by the [[Bellegere Otherys (courtesan)|Black Pearl of Braavos]]. Mercy\'s friend [[Daena (mummer)|Daena]] tells her that the Black Pearl descends from a [[Aegon IV Targaryen|Targaryen King]], but Mercy states that the term &quot;Brown Pearl&quot; would be more fitting, due to her skin colour. They speak about the sigil of the envoy, and Daena points out that the envoy\'s guards have lions for their sigil. Then, Mercy sees a [[Rafford|familiar face]]. She points him out to Daena, telling her she thinks he\'s fair to look upon. Mercy goes in search for him, pretending towards the other mummers that she\'s off to practice her lines for the play - it\'s the first time she\'s gotten lines in a play, and everyone expects her to be nervous to get them right.\n\nThe man Mercy is looking for is found guarding the entrance to the envoy\'s seating with another lion guard. The guards are discussing the length of their stay, claiming that &quot;if [[Harys Swyft|he]] returns without gold - from the [[Iron Bank]] - , the [[Cersei Lannister|Queen]] will have his head&quot;. Mercy approaches Rafford as the play begins. When they turn out not to understand Braavosi, Mercy speaks to them in broken [[Common Tongue]], telling them that \'\'&quot;Izembaro said to please the lords&quot;\'\'. His companion is disgusted by the thought of sleeping with a girl so young, but Rafford sees no problem. Mercy takes him back to her little room a few blocks away from the Gate, warning him they have to hurry, otherwise Mercy will miss her rape in the second act. She teases him that he could be a mummer, and that she could teach him a line to say. Once in her room, Mercy  slides her finger down the inside of Raff\'s thigh, but when Raff insists she unlace him, Mercy tells him he\'s bleeding. Rafford doesn\'t understand, but he starts to bleed heavily, and calls for Mercy to get a healer. Mercy insists that the healer will only help those who come to him. When Rafford tells her that [[Lommy Greenhands|he can\'t walk, and she\'ll have to carry him]], Mercy happily thinks to herself \'\'&quot;See? You know your line, and so do I.&quot;\'\'\n\n&quot;You think so?&quot; [[Arya Stark]] asks [[Rafford|Raff the Sweetling]], as she takes the blade from her sleeve. She kills him, whispering &quot;Valar Morghulis&quot;. Knowing that this will be the end of Mercy, Arya realizes she\'ll miss Daena, Izembaro and Bobono, but that there is no time to think about that now. Mercy still has some lines to say in the play, and she must not miss her own rape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.is/6UYCu \'\'The Winds of Winter\'\', Mercy\'s sample chapter], made available on [[George R.

Eventually, he is discovered and Jaime shoves him out the window.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe majority of the men have gone hunting boar with the [[Robert Baratheon|king]], leaving Bran behind with [[Jon Snow|Jon]], [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]], and the girls. Jon seems to be angry with everyone, even though he\xe2\x80\x99s going to [[the Wall]] with [[Benjen Stark|Uncle Benjen]], so Bran does not look very hard for him.\n\nAt first Bran was excited about leaving [[Winterfell]] and going to [[King\'s Landing]] on a real horse, not just a pony. He remembers the stories [[Old Nan]] told about ghosts, terrible dungeons, and dragon skulls on the walls. He dreams of being a member of the [[Kingsguard]] someday and is anxious to meet the greatest living knight, Ser [[Barristan Selmy|Barristan the Bold]]. But now Bran is also apprehensive about leaving the only home he has ever known. He will miss all those he is leaving behind, even his pony. \n\nNot being able to stand the goodbyes, Bran goes to the castle [[godswood]] with his [[direwolf]]. Unlike all his siblings, he still hasn\xe2\x80\x99t named his wolf; none of the names he tries seem right. Eventually, Bran gets tired of trying to teach his wolf to fetch and decides to go climbing. His wolf doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want him to go and howls when he climbs away up a tree and onto the armory roof.\n\nBran spends much of his time climbing the roofs of Winterfell. His [[Catelyn Stark|mother]] claims that he could climb before he could walk. Since Bran cannot remember learning to climb or learning to walk he assumes it must be true. His mother is also terrified that one day he might fall and kill himself. Once Bran kept a promise not to climb for almost a fortnight and was miserable the entire time. Finally he gave in, but confessed his crime the next day. When his [[Eddard Stark|father]] ordered him to the godswood to cleanse himself, they found him sleeping in the tallest tree in the grove the next morning. His father, angry and laughing, told him that from now on he was free to climb, so long as his mother didn\xe2\x80\x99t catch him.\n\nOthers have tried to stop him, but to no avail. The guards tried to stop him, but they were too slow and escaping from them was fun. Old Nan once told a story of a boy who climbed too high and was struck by lightning and had his eyes eaten by crows, but Bran likes to feed the crows and they never seem interested in eating his eyes. [[Maester]] [[Luwin]] made a clay boy and threw it off the wall as an example, but Bran only responded that he is not made of clay and he never falls. \n\n[[File:Pojypojy_thingsIdoforlove.jpg\xe2\x80\x8e|thumb|300px|left|Jaime and his sister [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] caught \'\'in flagrante\'\' at [[Winterfell]] - by Pojypojy\xc2\xa9]]\n\nBran is climbing toward the Broken Tower, where he likes to feed the crows, when he is startled by voices from the First Keep, the oldest part of the castle. At first he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t recognize them as Queen [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] and her brother, Ser [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]. Cersei is telling Jaime that he should be the [[Hand of the King]] and that Eddard Stark will put them in danger because the king loves him like a brother. Jaime jokes that Robert hates his brothers. Unamused, Cersei insists that Robert will listen to Eddard. Jaime states that he prefers honorable men to ambitious men like Robert\xe2\x80\x99s brothers and [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]].\n\nCersei says she is worried about what [[Lysa Arryn]] may have said to the Starks, but Jaime tells her not to worry, as Lysa has no proof. Despite this, Cersei remains fearful that Eddard might betray her son [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] when he takes the throne or convince Robert to put her aside.\n\nBran grows frightened by what he overhears but wants to see who is talking, so he climbs over the window, then drops down. He can see the man and woman inside, naked and wrestling, fondling, and moaning. He recognizes Cersei just as her eyes open and she sees him. Bran loses his grip as he tries to escape, but he catches himself on the window ledge. Cersei and Jaime come to look at him. Jaime extends a hand to Bran and pulls him up onto the ledge.\n\nAs Bran begins to relax, Jaime asks him how old he is. Bran tells him he is seven. Then Jaime loathingly says, \xe2\x80\x9cThe things I do for love,\xe2\x80\x9d and shoves Bran backwards out the window into the empty air.\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Bran Stark]]\n*[[Cersei Lannister]]\n*[[Jaime Lannister]]\n*[[Summer (direwolf)|Summer]]\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Aemon Targaryen|Aemon]]\n*[[Arryk]]\n*[[Arthur Dayne]]\n*[[Arya Stark]]\n*[[Barristan Selmy]]\n*[[Benjen Stark]]\n*[[Boros Blount]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n*[[Erryk]]\n*[[Gage]]\n*[[Gerold Hightower]]\n*[[Ghost]]\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Grey Wind]]\n*[[Hodor]]\n*[[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n*[[Jon Arryn]]\n*[[Jon Snow]]\n*[[Jory Cassel]]\n*[[Lady (direwolf)|Lady]]\n*[[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]]\n* Maester [[Luwin]]\n*[[Lyanna Stark]]\n*[[Lysa Arryn]]\n*[[Meryn Trant]]\n*[[Mikken]]\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*Old [[Nan]]\n*[[Renly Baratheon]]\n*[[Rickon Stark]]\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n*[[Rodrik Cassel]]\n*[[Ryam Redwyne]]\n*[[Sansa Stark]]\n*[[Serwyn]]\n*[[Shaggydog]]\n*[[Stannis Baratheon]]\n*[[Theon Greyjoy]]\n|}\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[Casterly Rock]]\n*[[Eyrie]]\n*[[King\'s Landing]]\n*[[The Neck]]\n*[[Wall]]\n*[[Winterfell]]\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[Dance of the Dragons]]\n*[[House Dayne]]\n*[[Direwolf]]\n*[[Dragon]]\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[House Targaryen|Dragonlord]]\n*[[Godswood]]\n*[[Hand of the King]]\n*[[House Hightower]]\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[Kingsguard]]\n*[[Night\'s Watch]]\n*[[House Redwyne]]\n*[[House Selmy]]\n*[[House Stark]]\n|}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2009/05/bran-tyrion.html Humorous review of the chapter]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/04/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-5 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/009/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{EnWikia|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 8}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 08]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Bran Stark|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 08]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Winterfell]]\n\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 09, Bran]]\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 8]][[pt:A Guerra dos Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 8]][[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\x91\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0\xd0\xbd II]]</text>\n      <sha1>n5l2crdlmc7609wp9lja0ivmpyrhmmi</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 49</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5653</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166792</id>\n      <parentid>143421</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-06-02T19:46:36Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Frernok</username>\n        <id>5007</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <comment>/*References and Notes*/</comment>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5219">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Catelyn Tully|Catelyn]]\n| title\t\t= Catelyn VI\n| place         = [[the Twins]]\n| page\t\t= 555\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 48|Jon VI]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 49|Catelyn VI]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 50|Arya X]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 45|Catelyn V]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 51|Catelyn VII]]\n}}\n   \n==Synopsis==\n[[File:Frey-hospitality.jpg|thumb|350px|left|The [[House Frey|Freys]] meet Robb and company.&lt;br&gt;\xc2\xa9 Fantasy Flight Games]]\n[[Robb Stark|Robb\'s]] host approaches [[The Twins]]. Robb rides at the head with [[Catelyn Tully|Catelyn]], [[Edmure Tully|Edmure]] beside him and Ser [[Raynald Westerling|Raynald]] bearing his banner. Catelyn cautions Robb again about offending Lord [[Walder Frey|Frey]], and advises him to ask for food and wine as soon as they arrive to secure the [[guest right]]s. They are met by a contingent headed by Ser [[Ryman Frey]], Lord Frey\'s grandson, and three of Ryman\'s sons: [[Edwyn Frey|Edwyn]], [[Black Walder]], and [[Petyr Frey|Petyr]]. When they come near, [[Grey Wind]] begins to growl and leaps forward, causing Petyr\'s horse to throw him. Ser Ryman is angered that Queen [[Jeyne Westerling|Jeyne]] is not among them and Catelyn offers her apologies, but Black Walder says that Lord Walder will be displeased. The Freys tell them they have rooms prepared for Robb, Catelyn, and Edmure, and their bannermen at the [[Twins|Water Tower]] but the army is to cross the bridge to the far end and join Lord Frey\xe2\x80\x99s and Lord [[Roose Bolton|Bolton]]\xe2\x80\x99s men beneath pavilions erected for the wedding. \n\nWhen they reach the gatehouse, Grey Wind refuses to continue and howls. [[Lothar Frey|Lame Lothar]] comes up, saying he must fear the water and offering to give him over to the master of hounds but Robb has Ser Raynald stay with him instead. Robb enters the great hall, where Lord Walder and his eighth wife [[Joyeuse Erenford|Joyeuse]] await. Lord Walder is relentless in his veiled insults against Robb, making it clear that the King betrayed him by breaking his solemn oath. Robb apologizes, and then [[Roslin Frey|Roslin]] is brought out. She is by far the most beautiful of Walder\xe2\x80\x99s get. After Edmure meets his soon-to-be-bride, Catelyn asks the Lord of the Crossing for some food and he says &quot;bread and salt . . . of course&quot; and the old man welcomes them as guests to his table. \n\nWhen Lord Bolton joins them, Robb finds out more of what happened at [[Winterfell]], and his bannerman tells him that [[Ramsay Bolton|Ramsay]] rescued many of the women and has been fighting the ironmen. Lord Bolton again states that his bastard son\xe2\x80\x99s blood is tainted, but maybe his deeds will atone for the crimes he committed. He tells them that Ramsay is holding [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] hostage, and he shows them a piece of Greyjoy\xe2\x80\x99s skin, his son having been flaying the captive Greyjoy. Bolton explains that as [[Balon Greyjoy]]\'s sole surviving son, Theon\'s uncles ([[Victarion Greyjoy|Victarion]], [[Euron Greyjoy|Euron]], and [[Aeron Greyjoy|Aeron]]) will want him dead as his claim to the [[Seastone Chair]] is greater than theirs, and that they can demand concessions from the ironborn as the price of Theon\'s execution; Robb reluctantly agrees for Theon to remain imprisoned at the [[Dreadfort]]. Bolton lost men crossing the [[Trident]] when [[Gregor Clegane]]\xe2\x80\x99s army attacked (see \'\'[[Battle of the Ruby Ford]]\'\'). Bolton has brought mostly his own and [[House Karstark|Karstark]] men, leaving all the others to guard the Trident.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Catelyn Tully]]\n*[[Edmure Tully]]\n*[[Raynald Westerling]]\n*[[Walder Frey]]\n*[[Ryman Frey]]\n*[[Edwyn Frey]]\n*[[Black Walder]]\n*[[Petyr Frey]]\n*[[Grey Wind]]\n*[[Jeyne Westerling]]\n*[[Roose Bolton]]\n*[[Lothar Frey]] Lame Lothar\n*[[Joyeuse Erenford]]\n*[[Roslin Frey]]\n*[[Ramsay Bolton]]\n*[[Theon Greyjoy]]\n*[[Balon Greyjoy]]\n*[[Gregor Clegane]]\n*[[Victarion Greyjoy]]\n*[[Euron Greyjoy]]\n*[[Aeron Greyjoy]]\n}}\t\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Riverrun]]\n*[[guest right]]\n*[[Twins|Water Tower]]\n*[[Winterfell]]\n*[[Seastone Chair]]\n*[[Dreadfort]]\n*[[Trident]]\n*[[Battle of the Ruby Ford]]\n*[[House Karstark]]\n}}\n\n\n==References and Notes==\n*The synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/05/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-29 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Part 29].

Each day, one of them is tortured by the [[Tickler]] for information about where valuables and food is hidden (with little result) and the whereabouts of Lord [[Beric Dondarrion]] (for no information). Finally they are marched to [[Harrenhal]] to serve under [[Tywin Lannister]]. [[Arya Stark|Arya]], after complaining about being assigned to the kitchen, is assigned to the understeward in the [[Wailing Tower]], [[Weese]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nFear has become part of [[Arya Stark|Arya]]\'s daily life as she walks the hard, rutted roads among a group of prisoners of [[Gregor Clegane]] and his men, a kind of fear she had never known until she was held captive in that storehouse at the shore of the [[Gods Eye]]. They spent eight days in the village and are now leaving on Clegane\'s command, and every day she has seen someone die. \n\nThe Mountain came into the storehouse each morning after breakfast to pick one of them to be interrogated. The village folk did not dare to look at him, maybe hoping they would escape his attention. But there was no way to hide from him, no way to be safe. He just chose whomever he liked. There was a girl he picked on the fourth day who had slept with a soldier three nights running, yet the soldier said nothing. There was an old man he picked on the fifth day, who had mended their clothing and declared so often that his son served in the [[City Watch of King\'s Landing|City Watch]] and did all for [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] that the other prisoners had actually started calling him [[All-for-Joffrey]]. There was a young mother with a pox-scarred face who had told Clegane everything she knew on the expectation they would spare her daughter for it, only to see her daughter be picked the next morning to make certain the mother held nothing back. \n\nThe interrogations always went down the same way. They were done in front of the whole group, so that everyone knew what happened to rebels and traitors. They call the ordinarily looking man who did the questioning [[Tickler|the Tickler]]. He was assisted by [[Chiswyck]], the old stoop-shouldered man who smashed Arya\'s head when they caught her, or by someone else, with Clegane just watching and listening until the prisoners died, which they invariably did. The questions were always about valuables or food hidden in the village, about the whereabouts of [[Beric Dondarrion]] and the size of his band and about who of the villagers had assisted them. They found a few valuables from the interrogations, but only got wildly inconsistent information about Dondarrion and his men. The longest someone survived the Tickler\'s treatment was until evenfall. The bodies were hung by the fires as food for the wolves. \n\nThe time in the storehouse has taught Arya that she is no [[Water Dancer]]. [[Syrio Forel]] would have never let them knock him down, take his sword, just watch as [[Lommy Greenhands]] was killed, or sit meekly by in that storehouse doing nothing while others died. She hates the villagers for being sheep almost as much as she hates herself for being a lamb, not a direwolf as the sigil of her house suggests. By now the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] have taken everything from her: father, friends, home, hope, courage, [[Needle]]. They broke her wooden sword in front of her. They have even taken away her secret of being a girl. She was still able to pee in privacy at the storehouse, yet on the open road that is not possible, even though she tried to hold it. [[Hot Pie]] gaped at her when she skinned her breeches at a brush in front of all, but nobody else even looked. Clegane\'s men didn\'t care at all.\n\nTheir captors have forbidden them to talk and they punish those who disregard the order, as Arya has learned herself by getting her lip broken. They smashed with a spiked mace the face of a boy who wouldn\'t stop calling for his father; then [[Rafford|Raff the Sweetling]] killed the boy\'s mother as well when she started screaming. Arya sees no purpose any longer in being brave, so she watches people die and does nothing. One woman who was questioned tried to be brave, but she died screaming just as the rest did. There are no brave ones left on this march, only women and children and very old or very young men. The other men were chained to the gibbet and left as food for wolves and crows. They only spared [[Gendry]] because he admitted that he had forged his helmet himself, as blacksmiths are too valuable to be killed.\n\nThe Mountain tells them that they will be taken to [[Harrenhal]] to serve Lord [[Tywin Lannister]], a last chance given to rebels and traitors, which they should take: &quot;Obey, serve, and live.&quot; Arya hears people arguing about this when they go to sleep that night. An old woman laments that what is being done to them isn\'t just, as they didn\'t commit any treason. Dondarrion\'s me just came and taken everything from them, as Clegane\'s did. Unlike the Mountain\'s men, Dondarrion\'s did the village folk no harm though, another woman points out, and [[Thoros of Myr]] even paid for what they took. Only with signed papers, the old woman replies, and those don\'t lay eggs as the chicken they took from her used to. Having made sure that no guard is looking, she spits three times for all Lannisters and [[House Stark|Starks]] and [[House Tully|Tullys]]. An old man says that the old king would have never stood for this sin and shame. Arya, forgetting herself, asks whether he is talking about [[Robert Baratheon|King Robert]], but the man meant [[Aerys II Targaryen|King Aerys]]. Then a guard interferes, the old man loses his two remaining teeth and everyone falls silent.\n\nBesides the prisoners, Clegane\'s band is also taking pigs, chickens, a cow, and nine wagons of salt fish to Harrenhal. The Mountain and his men are riding horses, but the captives have to walk and are killed if they cannot keep up or try to flee. The guards pick women at night and go into the bushes with them, receiving almost no resistance. There was one girl, prettier than the rest, who had to go with four or five different men each night, until she finally hit one with a stone one day. Clegane himself beheaded her with his massive two-handed greatsword and made everyone watch. He commanded that the body was to be left for the wolves. Arya has a side-look at Needle, worn at the hip by a black-bearded, balding man called [[Polliver]], thinking how good it is that they took the sword from her, as she would have used it to stab Glegane that moment \xe2\x80\x93 and that would likely have ended with her being left as food for the wolves as well.\n\nPolliver is hardly the worst of the lot, Arya thinks. By now she knows every one of Clegane\'s men, when they were only nameless strangers the night she was caught. It\'s important to keep in mind who of them is lazy or brutal, smart or stupid. The one they call [[Shitmouth]] has the foulest tongue she ever heard, yet he will give you an extra piece of bread if you ask, while jolly old Chiswyck or soft-spoken Rafford will only hit you. Arya observes them and listens to their talk, polishing her hates the way Gendry used to polish his helmet. She hates [[Dunsen]] for wearing Gendry\'s helmet, Polliver for taking Needle and Chiswyck for thinking he\'s funny. She hates even more the people she knows are responsible for the death of ones close to her: Raff the Sweetling for the death of [[Lommy Greenhands|Lommy]], [[Amory Lorch]] for the death of [[Yoren]], [[Meryn Trant]] for the death of Syrio, [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]] for the death of [[Mycah]], [[Ilyn Payne]] and Joffrey and [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] for the death of [[Eddard Stark|her father]], [[Tomard|Fat Tom]], [[Desmond]] and the rest, even for the death of [[Lady (direwolf)|Lady]], [[Sansa Stark|Sansa\'s]] direwolf. The Tickler is almost too scary to hate, though. There are times Arya almost forgets that he is coming along with the band, as he is completely inconspicuous when he isn\'t torturing people, just another soldier and actually quieter than most of them. Arya has started whispering to herself the names of the people she hates, she does it every night now. In [[Winterfell]], she used to pray with her father at the [[godswood]] and with [[Catelyn Stark|her mother]] in the [[sept]], but on the road to Harrenhal, whispering those names has become the only prayer left to her.\n\nFinally the trees give way to a more open landscape of hills, streams and fields \xe2\x80\x93 and the occasional burnt holdfast. After another day\'s march, they get the first glimpse of the towers of Harrenhal rising hard against the blue of the lake. Prisoners keep telling each other that things will get better at Harrenhal, but Arya is not sure about this, as she remembers [[Nan|Old Nan\'s]] stories about this castle built on fear and with mortar [[Harren Hoare|Black Harren]] mixed with human blood, but where he was roasted with all his sons by the dragons of [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] nonetheless. The castle is only a few more miles off, Arya thinks, yet they walk almost two more days before they reach Lord Tywin\'s army, encamped west of the castle in the scorched remains of a town, the stench from the overflowing latrines greeting them as they approach, telling Arya that the army has been here for some time. The sheer size of Harrenhal makes it deceptive to the eyes from afar, yet the gatehouse of the castle alone is as large as the Great Keep of Winterfell. Arya can only see the tops of the five immense towers from outside. Seeing their grotesque and misshapen form, looking like an old man\'s gnarled, knuckly fingers groping for the sky, she now believes every word Old Nan told about how the stones melted and flowed like candle wax, turning into a searing red as they sought out Harren where he hid.\n\nHot Pie does not want to enter the castle, declaring that there are ghosts within. Chiswyck gives him the choice of joining the ghosts or becoming one, so he walks in with the rest. In the echoing bathhouse, they have to strip and scrub themselves in tubs filled with scolding hot water, the process supervised by two fierce old women who talk about them like they are newly aquired donkeys. When they examine Arya, Goodwife [[Amabel]] is dismayed about her feet while Goodwife [[Harra]] has a closer look at the calluses she received while training with Needle. Harra believes Arya is a farmer\'s daughter and got them from churning butter. She tells Arya that she can earn a higher station in life if she works hard, but will be beaten if she does not. Asked for it, she does not dare to give away her true name, nor does she want to use Arry. Thus she says Lommy called her Weasel, the name of the first girl that comes to her mind. Amabel thinks the name is appropriate. She declares that Arya will lose her hair, as it is filled with lice, and will be assigned to the kitchen. Arya says she\'d rather tend the horses, thinking that she could steal one and escape. Harra slaps her so hard that her lip breaks again and commands her to shut up, as nobody is interested in her views. Arya thinks that Harra wouldn\'t dare slap her if she still had Needle. Amabel explains that Lord Tywin has grooms and squires to look after the horses and that the kitchen would have been a nice place for Arya, as it is snug and clean and one can always find a warm place to sleep there. However, Arya doesn\'t seem to be smart, so they should give her over to [[Weese]], Amabel suggests. They send her off with a rough-spun garb and ill-fitting shoes.\n\nWeese turns out to be the understeward for the [[Wailing Tower]], a squat man with a carbuncle on the nose and angry red boils at one corner of his lips. He tells the six assigned to him that the Lannisters are generous to those who serve them well, a fate none of them deserve. If they do well, they might rise one day as high as he did. However, if they intend to presume on Lord Tywin\'s kindness, they\'ll have to deal with Weese. They are told they are not to look the highborn in the eye, are only allowed to speak when spoken to and should not get in Lord Tywin\'s way. Weese says he can smell defiance, pride and disobedience, and if he does, they\'ll have to answer for it. All he wants to sniff of them is fear.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n*Analyses and summary of the chapter [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2011/11/arya-vi-prison-break-it-aint.html in the course of a 10th reread] by Slynt. \n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/03/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-13 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 26]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Arya Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place by the Gods Eye]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Harrenhal]]\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 26]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 27, Arya]]</text>\n      <sha1>03vwz5d5kn7yd7jabgvyahwmk148ppa</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Clash of Kings-Chapter 35</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6209</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>179964</id>\n      <parentid>166438</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-01-29T17:32:08Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Nittanian</username>\n        <id>3504</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7954">{{Infobox Chapter ACfK\n| pov\t\t= [[Bran Stark]]\n| place         = [[Winterfell]]\n| title\t\t= Bran V\n| page\t\t= 380\n| previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 34|Jon IV]]\n| current\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 35|Bran V]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 36|Tyrion VIII]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 28|Bran IV]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 46|Bran VI]]\n}}\n[[Bran Stark|Bran]] learns of his brother\'s victory, and the death of Ser [[Stevron Frey]], and realizes that [[Jojen Reed]]\'s prophesy has come true. Jojen now tells him of his [[Greenseer|green dream]] of the sea flowing over the walls of [[Winterfell]]. Bran tries to warn others, but mostly the dream is dismissed. Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]] finally returns with a prisoner, [[Reek]], who was involved in the forced marriage and then murder of Lady [[Donella Hornwood|Hornwood]]. Jojen reveals to Bran that he had a green dream in which Reek is skinning off Bran\'s face.\n==Synopsis==\n[[Bran Stark|Bran]] is found working the bellows for [[Mikken]] by [[Alebelly]] to tell him that there has been a bird from [[Robb Stark]]. Bran lets Alebelly carry him to Maester [[Luwin]]\'s turret where [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]] already waits. The maester informs them that Robb shattered a [[House Lannister|Lannister]] army at the [[Battle of Oxcross]], killing its commander Ser [[Stafford Lannister]]. He has also captured several castles, and is currently at [[Ashemark]], the stronghold of [[House Marbrand]]. Rickon asks if Robb is coming home, but Bran knows that only Lord [[Tywin Lannister]] matters, as [[Walder Frey (son of Jammos)|Big Walder]] states, which disquiets him. Neither Big Walder nor [[Walder Frey (son of Merrett)|Little Walder]] seem upset about their uncle Ser [[Stevron Frey]]\'s death, who, they note, was very old (50 or 60) and always tired. Little Walder asks if Ser [[Emmon Frey]] is now heir, and his cousin tells him the line of ascension: Ser [[Ryman Frey|Ryman]], [[Edwyn Frey|Edwyn]], [[Walder Frey (son of Ryman)|Black Walder]], [[Petyr Frey|Petyr]], then [[Aegon Frey]] and his sons. Little Walder states theat Ryman is too old, and then asks if they think he will be lord, and Big Walder responds he will be lord and does not care. The maester tells them that they should be ashamed.\n\n[[Osha]] arrives to carry him; she is stronger than Alebelly. Bran asks if she knows the way north, and she tells him it is easy. He then asks if the [[children of the forest]], the [[Others]] and [[giants]] are still there and she tells him she has seen giants and heard of the others. He then asks about the [[three-eyed crow]], which she has never heard of. She sets him on the window seat of his bedchamber.\n\nShortly thereafter, [[Jojen Reed|Jojen]] enters the room unbidden with [[Meera Reed|Meera]] behind him. Bran asks Jojen if he has heard about the bird; he states it was not supper, it was a letter from Robb. Jojen explains that the [[Greenseer|green dreams]] are not easy to understand.  When Bran asks Jojen to tell him his dream, Jojen reveals that he dreamed the sea was lapping all around Winterfell. Waves crashed against the gates and towers, and the water came flowing over the walls and filled the castle. Drowned men were floating in the yard. He now recognizes these men and declares that they are Alebelly, Septon [[Chayle]], and [[Mikken]]. Bran, confused and dismayed, replies that the sea is hundreds of leagues away, and Winterfell\'s walls are so high the water could not get in even if it did come. Jojen only repeats his claim, adding that he saw the dead, bloated and drowned. \n\nBran wants to warn the men, but Jojen tells him it will not save them, as they will not believe him. He then asks Bran to tell of his wolf dream, and Bran replies that there are different kinds. There are the wolf dreams, which are not as bad as the others, in which he runs, hunts and kills squirrels. He has other dreams where the crow comes and tells him to fly. Sometimes the tree is also calling his name in those dreams, which frightens him, but not as much as when he falls. He explains that he never used to fall while climbing, and that he used to feed the crows in the Burned Tower. Yet, he did fall eventually, and now when he sleeps he falls all the time.\n\nJojen tells Bran that he will be called a [[warg]] if others hear of his wolf dreams, and some will hate him in fear, as the power is strong in him. Bran is concerned since in [[Nan|Old Nan]]\'s stories wargs were always evil, and tells Jojen that he wants to be a [[knight]]. Jojen replies that he is a winged wolf but will never fly unless he opens the eye in his forehead, and he must search for it with his heart. When Bran states that Maester Luwin claims dreams are just that, Jojen responds they are the past, the future, and truth. With that they leave him, and Bran tries unsuccessfully to open his third eye.\n\nOn the following days, Bran tries to warn his household, but no one seems to believe him. Mikken thinks it funny, and states he always wanted to see the sea. Septon Chayle states the gods will take him when they do, and he does not think he will drown since he grew up on the banks of the [[White Knife]]. Alebelly takes heed, and refuses to bathe or go near a well until finally other guardsmen give him a bath because he stinks so badly.\n\nSer [[Rodrik Cassel]] returns with a man that [[Hayhead]] tells Bran is named [[Reek]]. He served the now-dead [[Ramsay Snow]] (the Bastard of Bolton). The bastard and Reek murdered Lady [[Donella Hornwood|Hornwood]]. Rodrik\xe2\x80\x99s men shot Snow as he attempted to ride away. He had forced Lady Hornwood to marry him and then to sign a will naming him heir. Ser Rodrik is concerned that [[Roose Bolton]] may not agree that doing this under duress would make the marriage and the will invalid. Rodrik wants to keep Reek alive for judgement when Robb returns. Meanwhile, [[House Manderly]] and [[House Bolton]] are fighting in the [[Hornwood]] forest, and Rodrik does not have the strength to stop them.\n\nSer Rodrik then brings up Bran commanding Alebelly not to bathe. Bran tells him about the green dream. Maester Luwin tells Rodrik that he has explained to Bran the uncertainty of prophesies, but then notes that raiders in longships have been plundering and raping along the [[harrying of the Stony Shore|Stony Shore]], and [[Leobald Tallhart]] sent his nephew [[Benfred Tallhart]] to deal with it. After he gets more information about the green dream, Rodrik promises not to take Alebelly with him if he rides against the raiders. Bran takes some hope in this.\n\nWhen Bran meets with the [[House Reed|Reeds]] later that night, Meera agrees that it should be possible to change prophesies. Meera gets angry with her brother when he disagrees, claiming that what he sees always comes true. Then Meera states that Alebelly and Bran should both fight to avoid their fates. Bran asks if he drowns also and Jojen reveals another dream of his, in which Bran and Rickon lay dead at Reek\'s feet, and he was skinning off their faces with a long red blade. Meera states that she could go down to the dungeons and kill Reek now, but Jojen tells her she will not succeed; first the jailers would stop her, and they will never believe. Even if Bran went to [[Greywater Watch]], he could not avoid his fate; the green dreams do not lie.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n*Summary and analyses of the chapter [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2011/12/re-read-bran-v-is-sea-coming.html in the course of a 10th reread].\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/05/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-17 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category:A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 35]]\n[[Category:A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Bran Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Winterfell]]\n\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 35]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 36, Bran]]\n[[zh:\xe5\x88\x97\xe7\x8e\x8b\xe7\x9a\x84\xe7\xba\xb7\xe4\xba\x89-\xe7\xab\xa0\xe8\x8a\x82 35]]</text>\n      <sha1>gti96az4o186yudk0w95ptzanr8x425</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Dance with Dragons-Prologue</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6804</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166979</id>\n      <parentid>166526</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-06-05T19:30:17Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3496">{{Infobox Chapter ADwD\n| pov\t\t= [[Varamyr Sixskins]]\n| place         = Beyond the Wall, in the [[haunted forest]]\n| title\t\t= Prologue\n| page\t\t= 3\n| previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Appendix|Appendix]]\n| current\t= Prologue\n| next\t\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 1|Tyrion I]]\n| arc previous\t= \n| arc next\t= \n}}\n\n\nWounded from the [[Battle of Castle Black]], skinchanger Varamyr Sixskins is dying, and tries to plot to take over the body of his companion [[Thistle]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe chapter begins from the perspective of a [[skinchanger]] in the body of a wolf. The [[warg]] leads a small pack on a hunt. They hunt [[free folk]] fugitives and kill them. \n\nAfter the kill the warg returns to his human body. He is [[Varamyr]] Sixskins and is seriously wounded. Like other free folk, he had fled after [[Battle of Castle Black|their defeat]] at Castle Black. Varamyr burned when [[Orell|his eagle]] was killed and he lost his cloaks and rings. After he robbed a dead woman of her cloak, her son stabbed him. His companion, Thistle, has sewn the wound together but it is too serious and Varamyr knows he is dying. \n\nHe thinks back over his youth when he was still called Lump. As a youth he had slipped into one of his father\'s dogs. The dogs killed [[Bump]], his little brother, and Varamyr remembers his brother looking at him and knowing. Because his father did not know which dog had killed Bump, he killed them all. When the last dog was killed, Lump - who was in him - screamed, which made his father understand his son\'s ability. His parents then brought Lump to [[Haggon]], another skinchanger. Haggon raised Lump and taught him about skinchangers, although Lump did not adopt his morals, particularly regarding what Haggon describes as abominations: eating the flesh of man while inside an animal, mating with a beast while inside one, and seizing the body of a human. When Haggon died, Varamyr drove him out of his wolf [[Greyskin]] to claim the wolf for himself. \n\nLater Varamyr adopted more animals and became Varamyr Sixskins. He established himself as a kind of lord, taking tribute in food and using his animals to bring him women from nearby villages. \n\nVaramyr wakes up from his memories when Thistle returns. As he knows that his body is dying, he turns on his companion to take over her body. She struggles and eventually manages to escape his control. As he dies, he half regrets trying to take over Thistle\'s body, but also half regrets failing at that. He awakens in the body of one of his wolves. Later his pack discovers Thistle. Frozen blood clings to her - she has become a [[wight]]. As her blue eyes stare into his wolf eyes he knows she sees him ...\n\n==Character List==\n{{columns|4|\n* [[Thistle]]\n* [[Haggon]]\n* [[Mance Rayder]]\n* [[Tormund]]\n* The [[Weeper]]\n* [[Mother Mole]]\n* [[Hornfoot|Hornfoot men]]\n* [[One Eye]]\n* [[Stalker]]\n* [[Sly]]\n* [[Borroq]]\n* [[Orell]]\n* [[Briar]]\n* [[Grisella]]\n* [[Greyskin]]\n* [[Varamyr|Lump]]\n* [[Jon Snow]]\n* [[Meha]]\n* [[Bump]]\n* [[Loptail]]\n* [[Sniff]]\n* The [[Growler]]\n}}\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{columns|4|\n* [[Milkwater]]\n* [[Hardhome]]\n* [[Gorge#Bridge of Skulls|Bridge of Skulls]]\n* [[Shadow Tower]]\n* [[Thenn]]\n}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 00]] &lt;!-- why the &quot;00&quot; ?--&gt;\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV miscellaneous]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place Beyond the Wall]]\n\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Pr\xc3\xb3logo]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 01, Prologue]]</text>\n      <sha1>mlfldi155olscbwxi0i9afr56in7l4g</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 68</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6250</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166233</id>\n      <parentid>122058</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-20T19:15:31Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Nittanian</username>\n        <id>3504</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3071">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]]\n| title\t\t= Sansa VI\n| place         = [[Drearfort|unnamed tower]] of House Baelish in the [[Fingers]]\n| page\t\t= 762\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 67|Jaime VIII]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 68|Sansa VI]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 69|Jon IX]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 61|Sansa V]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 80|Sansa VII]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:Morgaine le Fee alayne stone.jpg|300px|left|thumb|Alayne Stone. \xc2\xa9 Morgaine le Fee]]\n[[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] is alarmed to discover that [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] has no intention of bringing her home; instead she is being taken to [[the Vale of Arryn]].

All the plans were arranged by Littlefinger, who met Lady Olenna when he brokered the alliance that joined [[Highgarden]] and [[House Lannister]]. \n\nSoon after, [[Lysa Arryn]] arrives with a small retinue, and she insists that Petyr wed her now at his tower instead of the [[Eyrie]].

Attempts to tow the [[ships|cog]] north in hope of finding a breeze, using small rowing boats, have been unsuccessful.\n\nTyrion and Penny are talking when the ship suddenly starts to move. Everyone cheers until they notice the storm front looming on the horizon. [[Moqorro]] states that this is the storm from his visions (the reason that the ship won\'t reach [[Qarth]]). During the storm, the main mast breaks, crippling the ship. Moqorro and others are swept overboard, the captain and the cook die, and Tyrion is wounded from a splinter. For 19 days the ship barely manages to stay afloat as food and water dwindle and the sun beats down on them relentlessly. Then a sail turns up on the horizon, reigniting hope in them until [[Jorah Mormont|Jorah]] realizes it\'s a slaver ship.\n[[File:Marc Simonetti Tyrion Pretty Pig.jpg|[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] on [[Pretty Pig]]. \xc2\xa9 Marc Simonetti |thumb|350px|left]]\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n* [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n* [[Jaime Lannister]]\n* [[Tywin Lannister]]\n* [[Joffrey]]\n* [[Penny]]\n* [[Oppo | Groat (Oppo) ]]\n* [[Jorah Mormont]]\n* [[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n* [[Robb Stark]]\n* [[Stannis]]\n* [[Florian the Fool|Florian]]\n* [[Shae]]\n* [[Moqorro]]\n* [[Sansa Stark]]\n* [[Tysha]]\n* [[Benerro]]\n* [[Lemore]]\n}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 40]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Tyrion Lannister]]\n[[Category: Chapters which take place in the Gulf of Grief]]\n\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 40]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 41, Tyrion]]</text>\n      <sha1>t4zge83eo17lpuo0d99oma343earufr</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 17</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6823</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166551</id>\n      <parentid>166550</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-25T15:19:55Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6103">{{Infobox Chapter ADwD\n| pov\t\t= [[Jon Snow]]\n| place         = [[Castle Black]]\n| title\t\t= Jon IV\n| page\t\t= 218\n| previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 16|Daenerys III]]\n| current\t= Jon IV\n| next\t\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 18|Tyrion V]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 10|Jon III]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 21|Jon V]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\nDuring an inspection of the stores, [[Jon Snow|Jon]] is informed by [[Bowen Marsh]] and some other stewards that there is not enough\nto feed the [[Night\'s Watch]], the [[wildlings]], and [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]\' men through the winter. He grimly orders a cut in rations, though he knows it will make him unpopular, and tells Marsh they will find a way to feed everyone.\n\nHe is then summoned to meet with Stannis. [[Rattleshirt]] taunts Jon, offering to sing for him and pointing out the red ruby on his iron cuff, and Stannis tells Jon that he is handing the wildling to Jon. Despite his reluctance to be seen as partial to Stannis in the War of Five Kings, he advises him of the ways of the northern lords and offers him advice over how to win them over. He ignores the provocations of the [[Queen\'s Men]] as Stannis tells him that he plans to leave the Wall and take on [[Ramsay Bolton]] at the [[Dreadfort]] unawares.[[Arnolf Karstark]] has been urging Stannis to attack the Dreadfort claiming that it is lightly garrisoned.\n\nJon bluntly tells him that his plan will fail, earning more scorn from the Queen\'s Men. Stannis silences them and orders Jon to explain his reasons. Jon explains several things; firstly, unless Stannis wins [[Mors Umber]] (who is offering an alliance in exchange for certain conditions, namely the skull of [[Mance Rayder]] and a pardon for his brother [[Hother Umber]], who is fighting under duress for the Boltons) to his cause, Umber will cut Stannis\'s host to pieces as it crosses his land. Second, the Dreadfort will learn of Stannis\'s coming long before his arrival and Jon, having seen the castle\'s defences, knows that a small garrison could hold the Dreadfort against many times their number. Thirdly, with the imminent fall of [[Moat Cailin]] to [[House Bolton]], the combined armies of Ramsay and [[Roose Bolton]] will outnumber Stannis 5 to 1, and will easily destroy him as he lays siege to the Dreadfort. In addition, the northern lords Stannis seeks to rally to his cause, who have suffered generations of wildings raiding their holdings, will not be pleased to see his wildling conscripts crossing their lands.\n\nStannis orders everyone out of the room except Melisandre and Jon. Stannis again offers [[Winterfell]] to Jon, but Jon reminds him that Sansa is currently the rightful heir and that he cannot forsake his vows. Stannis says he plans to give Winterfell to [[Arnolf Karstark]], and Jon rebuts that the Karstarks abandoned his brother [[Robb Stark]]. Robb had personally beheaded Lord [[Rickard Karstark]] after the latter killed two of Stark\'s prisoners.{{Ref|aSoS|20}} Jon promises a source of more men to Stannis, if Stannis will let him keep the wildlings to occupy more of the forts at the Wall. Stannis agrees and Jon tells him of the petty lords of the mountains - [[House Flint of the mountains|House Flint]], [[House Wull]], [[House Norrey]], and [[House Liddle]]. Jon counsels Stannis to march through the mountains, win the mountain clans to his side, then emerge to attack [[Deepwood Motte]] and defeat the Ironmen to rouse the north to his side. Stannis agrees that it is a plan likely to succeed and impress the northmen. Jon also warns that the clansmen are deeply devout to the [[old gods]], warning Melisandre that her presence won\'t be welcome. Melisandre surprises Jon by telling him she will stay at the Wall. He ruefully reflects on how he has acquired a thousand wildlings whom he cannot feed.\n\n==Character list==\n{{columns|5|\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Dolorous Edd]]\n*[[Jon Snow]]\n*[[Bowen Marsh]]\n*[[Wick Whittlestick]]\n*[[Stannis Baratheon]]\n*[[Devan Seaworth]]\n*[[Ghost]]\n*[[Justin Massey]]\n*[[Richard Horpe]]\n*[[Sigorn]]\n*[[Rattleshirt]]\n*[[Melisandre]]\n*[[Harwood Fell]]\n*[[Godry Farring]]\n*[[Clayton Suggs]]\n*[[Lord Sweet]]\n\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Aemon Targaryen (son of Maekar I)|Aemon]]\n*[[Catelyn Stark]]\n*[[Lysa Arryn]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n*[[Tormund]]\n*[[Weeper]]\n*[[Dywen]]\n*[[Mance Rayder]]\n*[[Mors Umber]]\n*[[Greatjon Umber]]\n*[[Ramsay Bolton]]\n*[[Hother Umber]]\n*[[Hoarfrost Umber]]\n*[[Roose Bolton]]\n*[[Arnolf Karstark]]\n*[[Harlon Stark]]\n*[[Donal Noye]]\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n*[[Val]]\n*[[Cersei Lannister]]\n*[[Sansa Stark]]\n*[[Wyman Manderly]]\n*[[Rickard Karstark]]\n*[[Davos Seaworth]]\n*[[Torrhen Stark]]\n*[[Torghen Flint]]\n*[[Hugo Wull]]\n*[[Daeron I Targaryen]]\n*[[Alyn Velaryon]]\n*[[Balon Greyjoy]]\n}}\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{columns|7|\n*[[Castle Black]]\n*[[the Wall]]\n*[[Winterfell]]\n*[[wildlings]]\n*[[Mole\'s Town]]\n*[[Brandon\'s Gift]]\n*[[kingsroad]]\n*[[Eyrie]]\n*[[Vale of Arryn]]\n*[[Bridge of Skulls]]\n*[[House Baratheon]]\n*[[Night\'s Watch]]\n*[[King\'s Tower]]\n*[[Dragonstone]]\n*[[Battle of the Trident]]\n*[[House Umber]]\n*[[Oldtown]]\n*[[House Hornwood]]\n*[[House Cerwyn]]\n*[[House Tallhart]]\n*[[House Ryswell]]\n*[[House Dustin]]\n*[[House Lannister]]\n*[[House Bolton]]\n*[[Last Hearth]]\n*[[Dreadfort]]\n*[[Moat Cailin]]\n*[[Queen\'s Men]]\n*[[Bay of Seals]]\n*[[Last River]]\n*[[Lonely Hills]]\n*[[ironmen]]\n*[[King in the North]]\n*[[Battle of the Blackwater]]\n*[[House Karstark]]\n*[[Free Folk]]\n*[[Dawn Age]]\n*[[White Harbor]]\n*[[Warden of the North]]\n*[[House Greyjoy]]\n*[[House Stark]]\n*[[Bay of Ice]]\n*[[House Flint of the mountains|House Flint]]\n*[[House Wull]]\n*[[House Norrey]]\n*[[House Liddle]]\n*[[Dorne]]\n*[[Boneway]]\n*[[Planky Town]]\n*[[Greenblood]]\n*[[Prince\'s Pass]]\n*[[Deepwood Motte]]\n*[[King-Beyond-the-Wall]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n&lt;references/&gt;\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 17]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Jon Snow]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Castle Black]]\n\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 17]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 18, Jon]]</text>\n      <sha1>6d39ccw6gxstnhxletqa2i4muy7gb3k</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Game of Thrones-Chapter 62</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6022</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>177780</id>\n      <parentid>166005</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-12-23T15:52:20Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Nittanian</username>\n        <id>3504</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11488">{{Infobox Chapter AGoT\n| pov\t\t= [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n| place         = By the [[Green Fork]] of the [[Trident]]\n| title\t\t= Tyrion VIII\n| page\t\t= 564\n| previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 61|Daenerys VII]]\n| current\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 62|Tyrion VIII]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 63|Catelyn X]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 56|Tyrion VII]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 69|Tyrion IX]]\n}} __NOTOC__\n\n[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] and his [[Vale mountain clans|clansmen]] are assigned to the vanguard under the command of Ser [[Gregor Clegane]]. Returning to his tent, Tyrion is greeted by a whore named [[Shae]], whom [[Bronn]] has found for him. Before dawn, Tyrion is roused by the call to arms. In the ensuing [[battle on the Green Fork]], Tyrion and his clansmen do well and the enemy is routed. Afterward Lord [[Tywin Lannister]] learns that Robb Stark has tricked him.\n \n==Synopsis==  \nA long table draped with a golden cloth has been set up on a hill overlooking the [[kingsroad]] for Lord [[Tywin Lannister]] and his chief knights and lords bannermen to take their evening meal. [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]], arriving late, is embarrassed as he waddles up to the table. Lord Tywin mocks that he will charge Tyrion with burying the dead if he arrives as late to battle as he does to table. Tyrion replies sourly that surely a peasant or two could be found for him to kill.\n\nThe news from Ser [[Addam Marbrand]] is that [[Robb Stark]] has moved south from the [[Twins]] with [[House Frey]]\xe2\x80\x99s levies in tow and is now no more than a day away. Tyrion mockingly protests that he is about to eat and Tywin asks if the thought of coming to grips with Robb unmans him. Tyrion jests that he would prefer to come to grips with the roast pig, which is far more tender and better smelling than Robb. \n\nThe army\xe2\x80\x99s quartermaster, Lord [[Leo Lefford]], who has had to supply Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s 300 [[Vale mountain clans|clansmen]], uses this opportunity to quip that he hopes the clansmen are braver than Tyrion or else they have wasted good steel. Tyrion assures him that the arms and armor will be put to good use. Ser [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]], who Tyrion knows is giving voice to Lord Tywin\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts, takes the opportunity to inform Tyrion that he and his clansmen will fight in the vanguard since they seem so ferocious. Tyrion stresses the ferocity of the clansmen by recounting their recent lethal fight over a sausage. \n\nLord Tywin uses this as evidence of a poor commander who cannot maintain discipline. Tyrion knows that [[Jaime Lannister|his brother]] could always make men follow him eagerly, but Tyrion lacks such charisma and must use gold and his family name to get men to follow him. Tywin then tells Kevan that because the clansmen have no discipline, maybe they should not be in the vanguard. When Lord Tywin suggests that he should guard the baggage instead, Tyrion angrily agrees to command the vanguard, only to learn that he will not command, but be under Ser [[Gregor Clegane]]. Disgusted, Tyrion excuses himself after only eating one bite of the delicious pork.\n\nTyrion gets lost in the camp but finds his way by following the sounds of [[Shagga]]\xe2\x80\x99s laughter in the dark. [[Conn]] calls for him to share their meat and Tyrion agrees to join them when it is cooked, doubting that will be before the battle. When he reaches his tent, he finds Bronn sharing wine with his new servants\xe2\x80\x94a groom, a body servant, a squire named [[Podrick Payne]], and a slim young dark-haired whore named [[Shae]]. Tyrion told Bronn to find him a young one with a pretty face and to be sure to tell her who and what he is, so as to avoid the displeasing look of revulsion that sometimes greets him. He likes the girl Bronn has found.\n\n[[File:Shae by Amoka.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Shae, Tyrion Lannister\xe2\x80\x99s new mistress.]]\n\nTyrion invites Shae into his tent. When he asks if she is a maiden, Shae tells him that finding out will cost him double and Tyrion decides they will get along fine. Tyrion explains that her duties besides sleeping with him include serving him and monogamy. When they have sex, Shae expresses pleasure, which pleases Tyrion, who decides he does not care if it is feigned. Tyrion also finds it good to be with a woman after nearly a year of enforced abstinence.\n\nAfterward, he sneaks out of the tent without waking Shae. Outside, he asks Bronn where he found her and is told that she was stolen from a knight because all the pretty ones were taken. Tyrion comments that he did not ask Bronn to make him an enemy, but agrees to keep Shae. When Tyrion asks for the name of the knight so he can avoid him in battle, Bronn insists that Tyrion will have him for protection. Tyrion then tells Bronn that if they both survive the battle, he can name his reward. Bronn asks who would want to kill Tyrion and Tyrion explains who has put them in the vanguard. Bronn only laughs and jests that a small man with a big shield will give the enemy archers fits.\n\nTyrion returns to the tent to find Shae. When Tyrion asks whom Bronn has taken her from, she tells him that the knight was a minor figure and a small man. Tyrion mockingly asks if she takes him for a giant, but Shae insists she does, calling him \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99my giant of Lannister.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99\n\nTyrion wakes before dawn to battle horns and Shae\xe2\x80\x99s cries. Outside, Bronn informs him that the [[House Stark|Stark]] host has come down the kingsroad at night and they are forming up for battle a mile north. Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s well-fitting suit of armor is at [[Casterly Rock]], so Podrick Payne and Shae help him into the ill-fitting oddments that have replaced it. Tyrion asks Shae to weep for him if he dies, but she only asks how he will know. He is helped onto his heavily-armored horse and given his battle-axe. Shae tells him he looks fearsome, but Tyrion disagrees. He instructs his squire Podrick to take her safely home if they lose. As the sun rises and he rides north, the clansmen fall in behind him.\n\nOn the [[battle on the Green Fork|battlefield]], Lord Tywin commands the reserve in his magnificent armor that puts Jaime\xe2\x80\x99s to shame. Ser Kevan commands the center and Ser Addam Marbrand the right, where Lord Tywin has massed his armored knights. The northmen will be tired after their long sleepless march; Tyrion wonders what Robb Stark was thinking. \n\nTyrion spies the massive Ser Gregor Clegane with the vanguard massing on the left. Bronn, looking at Ser Gregor, states that it is best to follow a big man into battle since he attracts all the archers, which Tyrion finds amusing. They hear Ser Gregor tell his men that if anyone runs he will cut them down himself. Tyrion receives his orders to hold the left of the left next to the river. When Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s clansmen reach the [[Green Fork]], Tyrion commands them to keep themselves between the enemy and the river. Then the clansmen raise their battle cry of \xe2\x80\x9cHalfman!\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nAlthough the van is all mounted, it is comprised of misfits and sweepings, including half-trained boys. Tyrion notes that the force is unfit to hold the left, and wonders what his father was thinking. When the enemy appears, their numbers seem great, but Tyrion knows that his father has more. He also notes that the Freys are among the enemy. \n\n[[File:Black Ears.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s mountain clansmen ride to battle.]]\n\nThe northerners charge and are answered first by the Lannister bowmen. Ser Gregor orders the charge, and the clansmen quickly leave Tyrion in their dust. The charge nearly breaks against the [[House Karstark|Karstark]] spearmen opposing them, but Ser Gregor\xe2\x80\x99s horse crashes through the shield wall as it dies. The monstrous knight rises from his fallen mount and begins slaying men all around. Before the gap in the enemy line can close, Shagga rides through right behind Ser Gregor, followed by the other clansmen.\n\nThe northmen\xe2\x80\x99s line begins to crumble under the assault. Then Tyrion and Bronn are in the fight and Tyrion successfully defeats a number of enemies, including a close fight with a tall northerner whom Tyrion only overcomes because his horse bites the man\xe2\x80\x99s cheek, giving Tyrion the opening to kill him. Then a knight with a morning star comes at Tyrion, wounding and unhorsing him. The knight calls for Tyrion to yield, but Tyion uses the spike on his helmet to eviscerate the horse, which falls on the knight, disabling and trapping him. The knight yields to Tyrion. Tyrion can now see that the battle has moved past him. The northerners are being pushed against the hills and pelted by arrows. Finally, Bronn rides up and Tyrion sees his father ride by with the reserves to break the northerners. Tyrion finds the remnants of his clansmen, of whom perhaps half, including [[Conn]] and [[Ulf son of Umar]], are dead.\n\nTyrion searches for his father and finds him sipping wine as his armor is removed. Lord Tywin tells him that his clansmen fought well. Tyrion asks if that surprised him and if they were supposed to be butchered. Lord Tywin admits that he expected the left to collapse, hoping that Robb Stark would press into the breach where they might capture him. Tyrion demands to know why he was not informed. His father declares that a feigned rout is always less convincing and that he is not in the habit of trusting men who consort with [[Vale mountain clans|savages]] and [[sellsword]]s. Lord Tywin continues that the Stark boy proved more cautious than expected, but it is a victory. Then Tywin notes that Tyrion is wounded and Tyrion asks that he call for his [[maester]]s.\n\nAt that moment, Ser Addam Marbrand rides up with the news that Lord [[House Cerwyn|Cerwyn]], Ser [[Wylis Manderly]], [[Harrion Karstark]], and four [[House Frey|Freys]] were captured and Lord [[Halys Hornwood]] killed.

Afterward, [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] intercepts him and leads him to where [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] is hiding, where they plan their strategy for justice.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Eddard Stark|Ned]] arrives in [[King\'s Landing]] tired and ready for a meal and a hot bath. Instead, he is immediately informed by the royal steward that there is an urgent meeting of the [[small council]] that he must attend. After momentarily losing his temper, Ned decides it is best not to offend the council on his first day in the capital. Therefore, he tasks his own [[Vayon Poole|steward]] to see that his daughters are guided to their rooms and that Arya is not allowed to go exploring.\n\nIn borrowed clothes (his are all still packed), Ned arrives to find four members of the council waiting for him: [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] the [[Master of Coin]], [[Varys]] the [[Master of Whisperers]], [[Renly Baratheon]] the [[Master of Laws]], and [[Grand Maester]] [[Pycelle]]. The simpering eunuch Varys immediately expresses sorrow over the [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 16|troubles]] on the road and assures Ned they are all praying for Prince [[Joffrey]]\xe2\x80\x99s recovery. Ned coldly informs him that the prince grows stronger every day. When he sees Renly, Ned is struck by how much he looks like a young [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]]. Littlefinger immediately quips that Renly is much better dressed, having spent more on clothes than many ladies of the court. \n\nUpon introducing himself to Ned for the first time, Littlefinger mentions that [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] has most likely mentioned him before. Ned recalls that Littlefinger also knew his brother, [[Brandon Stark|Brandon]], adding that Brandon mentioned him often and with some heat. Littlefinger responds that he would have thought heat did not suit the Starks, who are rumoured to be made of ice and to melt south of [[the Neck]]. Ned replies that he does not plan on melting anytime soon.\n\n[[File:Jonny Klein Small Council ChamberII.png|thumb|280px|left|The small council chamber - by Jonny Klein. \xc2\xa9 Fantasy Flight Games]]\n\nAfter a short greeting to Grand Maester Pycelle, Ned asks after the other members of the council and is told that [[Stannis Baratheon]] left for [[Dragonstone]] shortly after the king went north and that both Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] and King Robert are still riding through the city. When Ned suggests they wait, Renly explains that Robert finds the details of coin and crops boring and rarely bothers to attend. Then Renly says that the king sent him ahead to convene the council to handle an urgent matter and Littlefinger produces a sealed letter for Ned.\n\nThe king\xe2\x80\x99s letter contains an order that a [[Tourney of the Hand|tourney]] be held in honor of Ned\xe2\x80\x99s appointment as [[Hand of the King]]. Ned is incredulous and not particularly happy with this extravagance being held in his name; the prizes alone total 90,000 gold dragons and the costs are sure to run high as well. When Ned questions whether the treasury will bear the expense, Littlefinger reveals that the Crown is already over six million gold pieces in debt, half of it to the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]]. Ned is shocked; the [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]] left a treasury overflowing with gold. He cannot believe that [[Jon Arryn]] allowed Robert to beggar the realm, but the council explains that while Lord Arryn was a prudent man, Robert did not always listen. Ned insists that this tournament is something the realm cannot afford and declares that they will consider it later, then leaves abruptly.\n\nAs Ned proceeds toward the [[Tower of the Hand]], reflecting on the miseries of the last fortnight of the journey south, he is intercepted by Littlefinger, who tells him he is going the wrong way. After a long journey through the [[Red Keep]], Ned eventually realizes that Littlefinger is not leading him to the Tower. Littlefinger explains that he is leading Ned to his wife, but Ned does not believe him. Eventually, Littlefinger brings him to the foot of a bluff outside the castle, where they mount onto waiting horses and ride into the city.\n\nLittlefinger leads Ned to a brothel he owns and tells him his wife is waiting inside. Ned is furious at being taken all this way to a brothel and holds a knife to Littlefinger\xe2\x80\x99s throat, claiming his brother was too kind. He is interrupted by a man he eventually recognizes as Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]], disarming his suspicions. Littlefinger leads Ned upstairs to meet with Catelyn, explaining that a brothel is such a good hiding place because it is so unlikely.\n\nAfter embracing and exchanging news with Catelyn, Ned sees the scars on her hands and she places the dagger used against [[Bran Stark|Bran]] in his hands. However, Ned cannot understand why [[Tyrion Lannister]] would have attempted to murder Bran. Littlefinger states that the reason is obvious, and that Tyrion would have never acted alone. Ned tries to assure himself that Robert could never have been involved in this, but he remembers all the horrid things the king has either supported or ignored. Queen [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]], on the other hand, Ned has no trouble believing to be responsible. Littlefinger reminds him that to accuse either is treason, but that if they can find proof of Cersei\xe2\x80\x99s involvement, it is possible the king will listen.\n\nNed feels that he should take his case and the dagger directly to the king, but Littlefinger reminds him that there is no solid proof that Tyrion was involved. Then Catelyn explains that she has told Littlefinger about their suspicions concerning Jon Arryn\xe2\x80\x99s death, and that Littlefinger has promised to help them learn the truth. When Ned asks how much Varys knows about all of this, he is told that Varys has not been told, but Catelyn warns that the man knows things no normal man has any way of knowing.\n\nNed then asks Littlefinger to give him time alone with his wife. Littlefinger asks if they want time in a bed chamber but Ned tells him that will not be necessary; he just needs a little time. Catelyn goes to Littlefinger and tells him that she appreciates his efforts, and has found a brother that she thought she had lost. Ned is not so confident that Littlefinger can be trusted, but says nothing.  After Littlefinger leaves, Ned gives Catelyn instructions for his bannermen to fortify [[Moat Cailin]] and to keep a careful watch over [[Theon Greyjoy]] in case [[Balon Greyjoy|his father]]\xe2\x80\x99s [[Iron Fleet|fleet]] is needed. He hopes it will not come to war and that Robert will believe him when he finds out what happened.\n\xe2\x80\x83\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:20;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n* [[Eddard Stark]]\n* [[Vayon Poole]]\n* [[Renly Baratheon]]\n* [[Petyr Baelish]]\n* Grand Maester [[Pycelle]]\n* [[Varys]]\n* [[Catelyn Tully]]\n* [[Rodrik Cassel]] \n| style=&quot;width:20%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n* [[Robert Baratheon]]\n* [[Barristan Selmy]]\n* [[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n* [[Brandon Stark]]\n* [[Bran Stark]]\n* [[Arya Stark]]\n* [[Jory Cassel]]\n| style=&quot;width:20%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n* [[Stannis Baratheon]]\n* [[Aerys II Targaryen]]\n* [[Tywin Lannister]]\n* [[Mace Tyrell|Lord Tyrell]]\n* The [[High Septon]]\n* [[Jon Arryn]]\n* [[Sansa Stark]]\n| style=&quot;width:20%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n* [[Nymeria (direwolf)|Nymeria]]\n* [[Mycah]]\n* [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n* [[Aron Santagar]]\n* [[Rhaegar Targaryen]]\n* [[Lyanna Stark]]\n| style=&quot;width:20%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n* [[Ilyn Payne]]\n* [[Helman Tallhart]]\n* [[Galbart Glover]]\n* Lord [[Wyman Manderly|Manderly]]\n* [[Theon Greyjoy]]\n* Maester [[Luwin]]\n|}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2009/05/eddard-tyrion_20.html Humorous review of the chapter]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/06/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-11 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/021/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 20]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Eddard Stark|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 20]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in King\'s Landing]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 20]]\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 21, Eddard]]\n[[pt:A Guerra dos Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 20]]\n[[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\xad\xd0\xb4\xd0\xb4\xd0\xb0\xd1\x80\xd0\xb4 IV]]</text>\n      <sha1>sovikelle04hm6h2ag3by2x19gxkghf</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Feast for Crows-Chapter 11</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>3911</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>141519</id>\n      <parentid>122088</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2014-09-02T19:47:08Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Nittanian</username>\n        <id>3504</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <minor/>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4297">{{Infobox Chapter AFfC\n| pov\t\t= [[Asha Greyjoy]]\n| place         = [[Ten Towers]]\n| title\t\t= The Kraken\'s Daughter\n| page\t\t= 159\n| previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 10|Sansa I]]\n| current\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 11|The Kraken\'s Daughter]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 12|Cersei III]]\n| arc previous\t= \n| arc next\t=\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Asha Greyjoy|Asha]] is at [[Ten Towers]] waiting for her supporters to arrive. The feast is almost over. There are a lot of [[House Harlaw|Harlaws]] in the hall but not enough of the other houses. Asha knows she lacks support. \n\nShe tells [[Three-Tooth]] to find food for her crew and her prisoners. Then she goes to her uncle [[Rodrik Harlaw]], the lord of Harlaw. She finds him in the [[Ten Towers#Book Tower|Book Tower]], reading. Rodrik Harlaw loves his books. It is this love that earned him the nickname &quot;The Reader&quot;. In Asha\'s name, Rodrik has sent summons to the captains to gather at Ten Towers. The captains of [[Harlaw]] isle have come but very few others. Rodrik informs Asha that [[Aeron Greyjoy]] has called for a [[kingsmoot]], an assembly of all captains to choose the king. Rodrik assures Asha that her cause is hopeless, since no woman has ever ruled the [[ironborn]]. Even the support of Rodrik does not mean his vassals will support her. Their fealty is for war purposes only. In a kingsmoot they are allowed to vote as they please. Rodrik councils Asha to stay away from the kingsmoot. Besides her lack of support, he is afraid that [[Euron Greyjoy]] will kill his competitors. Rodrik offers to give her Ten Towers instead. His heir [[Harras Harlaw]] does not need Ten Towers and will protect her. Asha declines the offer and walks back to the hall. \n\nShe encounters [[Tristifer Botley]] on the way. When they were young, Tristifer was in love with Asha. Asha liked him in the beginning but became bored with him before he was sent away. Tristifer, though, has never forgotten her and wants to wed Asha. He is the legitimate Lord of [[House Botley]]. His [[Sawane Botley|father]] has been killed by Euron Greyjoy for refuting Euron\'s claim to the throne. His titles have been given to Tristifer\'s uncle who supported Euron. Asha sharply refuses Tristifer\'s advances by reminding him that they are not children anymore and that she is his queen, not his wife.\n\n\n\'\'\'Easter egg\'\'\': In the chapter Rodrik Harlaw mentions an Archmaester named [[Rigney]] who believes that history is a wheel. \'\'[[w:The Wheel of Time|The Wheel of Time]]\'\' fantasy series author Robert Jordan\'s real name is James Rigney.\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:20%&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Asha Greyjoy]]\n*[[Qarl the Maid|Qarl]]\n*[[Boremund Harlaw]]\n*[[Hotho Harlaw]]\n*[[Sigfryd Harlaw]]\n*[[Rodrik Harlaw]]\n*[[Three-Tooth]]\n*[[Tristifer Botley]]\n| style=&quot;width:20%&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Sawane Botley]]\n*[[Harren Botley]]\n*[[Alannys Harlaw]]\n*[[Gwynesse Harlaw]]\n*[[Balon Greyjoy]]\n*[[Theon Greyjoy]]\n*[[Rodrik Greyjoy]]\n*[[Maron Greyjoy]]\n*[[Sybelle Locke]]\n| style=&quot;width:20%&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Erena Glover]]\n*[[Theomore Harlaw]]\n*Archmaster [[Marwyn]]\n*[[Aenar Targaryen]]\n*[[Maegor I Targaryen]]\n*Maester [[Wendamyr]]\n*[[Euron Greyjoy]]\n*[[Baelor Blacktyde]]\n*[[Aeron Greyjoy]]\n*[[Beron Blacktyde]]\n| style=&quot;width:20%&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Tarle]]\n*[[Old Grey Gull]]\n*[[Victarion Greyjoy]]\n*[[Haereg]]\n*[[Urron Greyiron]]\n*Archmaster [[Rigney]]\n*Maester [[Denestan]]\n*[[Harras Harlaw]]\n*[[Stannis Baratheon]]\n*[[Tywin Lannister]]\n| style=&quot;width:20%&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Germund Botley]]\n*Maester [[Qalen]]\n*Maester [[Joseran]]\n*[[Jon Myre]]\n*[[Lucas Codd]]\n*[[Harren Half-Hoare]]\n*[[Kemmett Pyke]]\n*[[Rodrik Freeborn]]\n*[[Torwold Browntooth]]\n|}\n==References and Notes==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/03/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-feast-for-crows-part-7 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Feast for Crows, Part 7].

Cersei feels fear at the thought of being paraded through the streets naked, remembering the violence the smallfolk caused during the [[Riot of King\'s Landing|riot]], but reassures herself that no harm will come to her.  \n\nWhen morning arrives, her goalers arrive with a group of [[Silent Sisters]], who strip Cersei naked and shave her of every hair on her body. Cersei is then led by an escort of [[Warrior\'s Sons]] (among them, her cousin [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], much to Cersei\'s disgust) to the courtyard, where Cersei finds herself standing close to the spot where [[Eddard Stark]] was executed. As the Septas accompanying her announce her sins to the watching crowd, Cersei muses first on how [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] undid all her plans and the work of [[Varys]] and [[Littlefinger]]; had he done as he was told and sent Stark to [[the Wall]], Ned and his knowledge of Cersei\'s incest would have been removed and the Lannisters would have had peace with [[Robb Stark]], a hostage in the form of [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] and the freedom to deal with [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] and [[Renly Baratheon]], but instead Joffrey demanded Stark\'s head, and after that everything fell apart. Cersei\'s thoughts then turn to memories of how [[Tywin Lannister|her father]] did away with her [[Tytos Lannister|grandfather\'s]] mistress after his death, having her stripped naked and marched through the streets of [[Lannisport]], but Cersei insists to herself she will not be broken and humiliated so easily.  \n\nCersei is then forced to strip before the crowd and walk to the Red Keep. At first, Cersei walks with dignity, ignoring the insults and worse (such as rotten vegetables and a cat carcass) the crowd throw at her, but as the walk continues and the insults grow worse, mocking her faded beauty and the signs of age on her body, Cersei struggles to maintain her composure. As she walks, Cersei begins to hallucinate, seeing faces of others in the crowd; her father frowning, Ned and Sansa Stark, along with [[Lady (direwolf)|Sansa\'s wolf]] staring accusingly at her, [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] laughing at her and finally, the face of [[Maggy the Frog]] intoning her prophecy: \'\'Queen you shall be, until there comes another, younger and more beautiful, to cast you down and take all you hold most dear\'\'. \n\nAt this, Cersei breaks down in tears and runs for the Red Keep, collapsing as soon as she staggers into the courtyard. Kevan Lannister orders her covered up and removed, at which point Cersei is picked up by an eight-foot-tall giant of a man, clad in the armour and white cloak of a [[Kingsguard]] knight. [[Qyburn]] appears and introduces Cersei to his champion, [[Robert Strong|Ser Robert Strong]] and she is most pleased.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n* [[Cersei Lannister]]\n* [[Kevan Lannister]]\n* [[Margaery Tyrell]]\n* [[Lancel Lannister]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n*[[Varys]]\n*[[Littlefinger]]\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Sansa Stark]]\n*[[Stannis Baratheon]]\n*[[Renly Baratheon]]\n*[[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n*[[Tywin Lannister]]\n*[[Tytos Lannister]]\n*[[Lady (direwolf)]]\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Maggy]] the Frog\n*[[Qyburn]]\n*[[Robert Strong]]\n}}\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Red Keep]]\n*[[Riot of King\'s Landing]]\n*[[Warrior\'s Sons]]\n*[[Lannisport]]\n*[[Kingsguard]]\n*[[Faith of the Seven]]\n}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 65]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Cersei Lannister]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Great Sept of Baelor]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in King\'s Landing]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 66, Cersei]]</text>\n      <sha1>rrcuxlj5vudbae5dbrouwjq3rp0053y</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Clash of Kings-Chapter 12</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5686</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166415</id>\n      <parentid>159640</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-23T20:46:24Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12141">{{Infobox Chapter ACfK\n| pov\t\t= [[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n| place         = The [[Red Waste]] - [[Vaes Tolorro]]\n| title\t\t= Daenerys I\n| page\t\t= 138\n| previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 11|Theon I]]\n| current\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 12|Daenerys I]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 13|Jon II]]\n| arc previous\t= \n| arc next\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 27|Daenerys II]]\n}}\n\n[[Daenerys Targaryen]] decides to follow the [[red comet]] deep into the [[red waste]] to protect her newborn [[dragons]]. Many of her \'\'[[khalasar]]\'\' die before they find shelter in a [[Vaes Tolorro|ruined city]]. There, Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] tells her about his second wife, [[Lynesse Hightower]]. While her people rest, Daenerys sends her three [[bloodrider]]s to scout, and [[Jhogo]] returns with three strangers from the great city of [[Qarth]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:Daenerys.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Daenerys Targaryen and her three dragons - by Amok\xc2\xa9]]\n\n[[Daenerys Targaryen]] commands her small \'\'[[khalasar]]\'\' to follow the [[red comet]] the [[Dothraki]] have named \'\'shierak qiya\'\', the Bleeding Star. The old men mutter that it is a bad omen, but it appeared the [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 72|night]] they cremated her husband [[Khal]] [[Drogo]] and hatched her [[dragons]], so Daenerys considers it the herald of her coming. Her handmaid [[Doreah]] explains that only the grim and terrible [[Red Waste|red lands]] lie in that direction, but Daenerys really has no choice. The other \'\'khalasars\'\' hold sway to the north, the [[Lhazareen]] to the south, and Khal [[Pono]] is driving slaves west to [[Slaver\'s Bay]]. When Daenerys argues that Pono always spoke to her kindly, Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] reminds her that Pono was the first to leave and will kill her now. She argues that she has dragons, but Jorah explains that the hatchlings would be easy to kill, though Pono is more likely to seize them, since a living dragon is priceless. Daenerys makes it clear they are hers and will never be taken while she lives, but Jorah insists she will not live long unless she goes where no one else does. Mounted on her [[The silver|silver mare]] and garbed in her white \'\'[[hrakkar]]\'\' pelt to cover her bald head, Daenerys commands her people to follow the comet and no words are raised against it; she is the Unburnt and Mother of Dragons, so her word is their law.\n\n[[File:Red Waste.jpg|thumb|400px|right|The Red Waste - \xc2\xa9 HBO]]\n\nThey ride by night, leaving a trail of dead horses because Pono, [[Jhaqo]], and the others have taken the best mounts. Her people are also the weak and unwanted, so Daenerys must project confidence and strength to encourage them. Three days into the march, the weakest of her people start to die.\n\nThere is little forage and less water in the red waste. When supplies run low, they are forced to live on horseflesh and the deaths increase. Daenerys suffers with her people; she sheds much weight and her milk dries up so she cannot breastfeed her dragons. They will not eat the meat she tries to feed them until she remembers her brother [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]] saying that only men and dragons eat cooked meat. From then on, the dragons devour several times their own weight in seared meat every day and begin to prosper. \n\nEach night, Daenerys lets one of the dragons ride on her shoulder, while [[Irri]] and [[Jhiqui]] carry the other two in a cage slung between their horses. One day, [[Aggo]] says her black dragon is [[Balerion]] reborn. Daenerys recalls that her ancestor [[Aegon I Targaryen]]\'s dragons were named after the gods of Old [[Valyria]], but decides to name hers after those the gods have taken from her. She names the green-and-bronze one [[Rhaegal]] after her brother [[Rhaegar Targaryen]], the cream-and-gold one [[Viserion]] after her brother Viserys, and the black-and-scarlet one [[Drogon]] after her husband Drogo.\n\nYet even as her dragons prosper, her \'\'khalasar\'\' withers. Some are forced to walk because there are no longer enough horses to go around. Doreah, who has been ill for a while, develops a fever and finally grows too weak to mount her horse. Daenerys stops the \'\'khalasar\'\' and personally cares for the girl who taught her how to seduce Khal Drogo, holding her hand until she finally dies.\n\nAs the environment continues to worsen, the Dothraki begin to fear the comet has led them to some hell, and even Daenerys begins to despair. She goes to Ser Jorah to ask if the waste has an end. He assures her it does end, though the way is harder than he dared to think. Daenerys notes that the knight is still suffering from the wound he took [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 64|fighting]] [[Qotho]], but he still urges their only choice is to press on. \n\nA few days later, her outriders return with news of a city that even Ser Jorah can tell her nothing about. She sends her [[bloodrider]]s Aggo, [[Jhogo]], and [[Rakharo]] to scout the city. When they report that the city is dead, Jhiqui insists that such places are haunted by ghosts and best avoided. This does not dissuade Daenerys, and she leads her \'\'khalasar\'\' into the deserted city. Inside, Daenerys passes an empty plinth and wonders if its statue now stands in [[Vaes Dothrak]].\n\n[[File:Vt.jpg|thumb|400px|left|Ser Jorah\'s gift - by Dorota Pijewska\xc2\xa9]]\n\nThey find fruit trees and fresh water, but also bones. Irri mutters about ghosts, but Daenerys assures her dragons are more powerful, though food, water, and fodder are more important.  After Daenerys settles into her tent and bathes in sand, Ser Jorah arrives to give her a peach, which she savors. She declares that the gods were good to lead them to this place, and Jorah replies that they should rest and gather their strength.\n\nDaenerys mentions that her handmaids worry about ghosts, but the knight points out there are ghosts everywhere. Daenerys remembers those she has lost and asks the name of Ser Jorah\'s ghost. He names his second wife, the beautiful [[Lynesse Hightower]]. When Daenerys presses for more information, Jorah explains that his home on the remote [[Bear Island]] is cold and rustic. His first wife, a [[House Glover|Glover]], whom he loved after a fashion, died from her third miscarriage after ten years of marriage. Soon after, he fought in the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]] and earned his knighthood when he followed [[Thoros of Myr]] through the breach at [[Pyke]]. Afterward, King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] held a tourney outside [[Lannisport]], where Jorah met Lynesse and held [[Jaime Lannister]] to a draw in the final joust, earning the champion\'s laurel and naming Lynesse queen of love and beauty. That night, drunk on wine and victory, he asked Lord [[Leyton Hightower]] for his daughter\'s hand, and they were married there in Lannisport. However, Bear Island was a disappointment to Lynesse. Jorah went to great expense to import what she wanted, and when that failed he entered tourneys but never distinguished himself again. Each loss cost a suit of armor and a charger, and soon he was broke. Lynesse was unwilling to give up her jewels, so Jorah did shameful things for gold. When he heard [[Eddard Stark]] was coming to punish him, he fled with his  wife to [[Lys]]. In half a year, their money was gone and he was forced to become a [[sellsword]], and while he was away fighting, Lynesse moved in with the merchant prince [[Tregar Ormollen]]. When Daenerys asks, Jorah explains that he hates Lynesse almost as much as he loves her. As Jorah is leaving, Daenerys asks what Lynesse looked like, and Jorah replies that she looked a lot like her.\n\nAfter he leaves, Daenerys realizes Ser Jorah loves her and wants her, not as a queen but as a woman. She tries to image herself with him, but it is no good. She also noticed his longing to return to Bear Island. He can never have her, but she hopes one day to give him back his home and his honor. That night she dreams of riding dragons with Drogo.\n\nThe next morning, she calls her bloodriders and orders them each to take three healthy horses and plenty of supplies to go scouting: Aggo to the southwest, Rakharo to the south, and Jhogo to the southeast. While they wait for the bloodriders to return to the city (which they name [[Vaes Tolorro]]) the \'\'khalasar\'\' has a chance to recover, and Daenerys tends to Ser Jorah\'s hip wound, which finally starts to heal.\n\nRakharo returns first to report the wasteland stretches south all the way to the ocean. Daenerys puts him in charge of pulling up the plaza so more grass might grow for the horses. Aggo returns next, having found only two deserted cities smaller than Vaes Tolorro. Daenerys sets him to work repairing the city gates. Jhogo is the last to return, much later, bringing three queerly garbed strangers from the great city of [[Qarth]]: the great warlock [[Pyat Pree]], the merchant prince [[Xaro Xhoan Daxos]] of the [[Thirteen]], and [[Quaithe]] of the Shadow. They come seeking dragons, and Daenerys declares they have found them.\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot;

In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister and supernatural forces are massing beyond the kingdom\xe2\x80\x99s protective Wall. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the land they were born to. Sweeping from a land of brutal cold to a distant summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, here is a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim omens.\n\nHere an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a tribe of fierce wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his throne; and a determined woman undertakes the most treacherous of journeys. Amid plots and counterplots, tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, the fate of the Starks, their allies, and their enemies hangs perilously in the balance, as each endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts: the game of thrones. \n\n{{Clear}} \'\'\'Chapter Summaries\'\'\' | [[Chapters Table of contents#A Game of Thrones|Page Table]].&lt;hr&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n{{Columns|count=6|style=color:#333;|data =\n&lt;ol start=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;[[A Game of Thrones-Prologue| Prologue \t]]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 1| Bran I \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 2| Catelyn I \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 3| Daenerys I \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 4| Eddard I \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 5| Jon I \t\t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 6| Catelyn II \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 7| Arya I \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 8| Bran II \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 9| Tyrion I \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 10| Jon II \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 11| Daenerys II \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 12| Eddard II \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 13| Tyrion II \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 14| Catelyn III \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 15| Sansa I \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 16| Eddard III \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 17| Bran III \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 18| Catelyn IV \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 19| Jon III \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 20| Eddard IV \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 21| Tyrion III \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 22| Arya II \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 23| Daenerys III \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 24| Bran IV \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 25| Eddard V \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 26| Jon IV \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 27| Eddard VI \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 28| Catelyn V \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 29| Sansa II \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 30| Eddard VII \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 31| Tyrion IV \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 32| Arya III \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 33| Eddard VIII \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 34| Catelyn VI \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 35| Eddard IX \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 36| Daenerys IV \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 37| Bran V \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 38| Tyrion V \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 39| Eddard X \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 40| Catelyn VII \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 41| Jon V \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 42| Tyrion VI \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 43| Eddard XI \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 44| Sansa III \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 45| Eddard XII \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 46| Daenerys V \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 47| Eddard XIII \t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 48| Jon VI\t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 49| Eddard XIV\t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 50| Arya IV\t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 51| Sansa IV\t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 52| Jon VII\t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 53| Bran VI\t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 54| Daenerys VI\t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 55| Catelyn VIII\t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 56| Tyrion VII\t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 57| Sansa V\t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 58| Eddard XV\t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 59| Catelyn IX\t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 60| Jon VIII\t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 61| Daenerys VII\t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 62| Tyrion VIII\t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 63| Catelyn X\t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 64| Daenerys VIII\t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 65| Arya V\t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 66| Bran VII\t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 67| Sansa VI\t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 68| Daenerys IX\t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 69| Tyrion IX\t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 70| Jon IX\t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 71| Catelyn XI\t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 72| Daenerys X\t]]\n# [[A Game of Thrones-Appendix| Appendix\t]]\n}}&lt;/div&gt;  \n&lt;div style=&quot;background:#F2EEE6;color:#333;border:6px double white;margin:-3px -3px 2px -3px;padding:8px 12px;&quot;&gt;\n\n==\'\'[[A Clash of Kings]]\'\'==\n[[Image:AClashOfKings.jpg|right|125px|link=A Clash of Kings]]\n\nTime is out of joint. The summer of peace and plenty, ten years long, is drawing to a close, and the harsh, chill winter approaches like an angry beast. Two great leaders\xe2\x80\x94Lord Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon, who held sway over an age of enforced peace\xe2\x80\x94are dead, victims of royal treachery. Now, from the ancient citadel of Dragonstone to the forbidding wilds of Winterfell, chaos reigns, as pretenders to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms prepare to stake their claims through tempest, turmoil, and war.\n\nAs a prophecy of doom cuts across the sky\xe2\x80\x94a comet the color of blood and flame\xe2\x80\x94six factions struggle for control of a divided land. Eddard\'s son Robb has declared himself King in the North. In the south, Joffrey, Robert\'s heir, rules in name only, victim of the scheming courtiers who teem over King\'s Landing. Robert\'s two brothers each seek their own dominion, while the disfavored House Greyjoy turns once more to conquest. And a continent away, an exiled queen, the Mother of Dragons, risks everything to lead her precious brood across a hard hot desert to win back the crown that is rightfully hers.\n\n{{Clear}} \'\'\'Chapter Summaries\'\'\' | [[Chapters Table of contents#A Clash of Kings|Page Table]].\n-----&lt;br&gt;\n{{Columns|count=6|data = \n&lt;ol start=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;[[A_Clash_of_Kings-Prologue| Prologue\t\t]]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 1| Arya I\t\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 2| Sansa I\t\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 3| Tyrion I\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 4| Bran I\t\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 5| Arya II\t\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 6| Jon I\t\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 7| Catelyn I\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 8| Tyrion II\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 9| Arya III\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 10| Davos I\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 11| Theon I \t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 12| Daenerys I \t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 13| Jon II\t\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 14| Arya IV\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 15| Tyrion III\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 16| Bran II\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 17| Tyrion IV\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 18| Sansa II\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 19| Arya V\t\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 20| Tyrion V\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 21| Bran III\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 22| Catelyn II\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 23| Jon III\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 24| Theon II\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 25| Tyrion VI\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 26| Arya VI\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 27| Daenerys II\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 28| Bran IV\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 29| Tyrion VII \t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 30| Arya VII\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 31| Catelyn III\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 32| Sansa III\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 33| Catelyn IV\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 34| Jon IV\t\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 35| Bran V\t\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 36| Tyrion VIII\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 37| Theon III\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 38| Arya VIII\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 39| Catelyn V\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 40| Daenerys III\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 41| Tyrion IX\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 42| Davos II\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 43| Jon V\t\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 44| Tyrion X\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 45| Catelyn VI\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 46| Bran VI\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 47| Arya IX\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 48| Daenerys IV\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 49| Tyrion XI\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 50| Theon IV\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 51| Jon VI\t\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 52| Sansa IV\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 53| Jon VII\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 54| Tyrion XII\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 55| Catelyn VII\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 56| Theon V\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 57| Sansa V\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 58| Davos III\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 59| Tyrion XIII\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 60| Sansa VI\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 61| Tyrion XIV\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 62| Sansa VII\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 63| Daenerys V\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 64| Arya X\t\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 65| Sansa VIII\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 66| Theon VI\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 67| Tyrion XV\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 68| Jon VIII\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 69| Bran VII\t]]\n# [[A Clash of Kings-Appendix| Appendix         ]]\n}}&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=&quot;background:#F2EEE6;color:#333;border:6px double white;margin:-3px -3px 2px -3px;padding:8px 12px;&quot;&gt;\n\n==\'\'[[A Storm of Swords]]\'\'==\n[[Image:AStormOfSwords.jpg|right|125px|link=A Storm of Swords]]\n\nOf the five contenders for power, one is dead, another in disfavor, and still the wars rage as violently as ever, as alliances are made and broken. Joffrey, of House Lannister, sits the Iron Throne, uneasy ruler of the land of the Seven Kingdoms. His bitterest rival, Lord Stannis, stands defeated and disgraced, victim of the jealous sorceress who holds him in her evil thrall. But young Robb, of House Stark, still rules the North from the fortress of Riverrun. Robb plots against his despised Lannister enemies, even as they hold his sister hostage at King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing, seat of the Iron Throne. Meanwhile, making her way across a blood-drenched continent is the exiled queen, Daenerys, mistress of the only three dragons still left in the world. \n\nAs opposing forces maneuver for the final titanic showdown, an army of barbaric wildlings arrives from the outermost line of civilization. In their wake is a horde of mythical Others, a supernatural army of the living dead whose animated corpses are unstoppable. As the future of the land hangs in the balance, no one will rest until the Seven Kingdoms have exploded in a veritable storm of swords.\n\n{{Clear}} \'\'\'Chapter Summaries\'\'\' | [[Chapters Table of contents#A Storm of Swords|Page Table]].&lt;hr&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n{{Columns|count=6|style=color:#333;|data =\n&lt;ol start=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;[[A Storm of Swords-Prologue| Prologue\t]]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 1| Jaime I \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 2| Catelyn I \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 3| Arya I \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 4| Tyrion I \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 5| Davos I \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 6| Sansa I \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 7| Jon I \t\t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 8| Daenerys I \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 9| Bran I \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 10| Davos II \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 11| Jaime II \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 12| Tyrion II \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 13| Arya II \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 14| Catelyn II \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 15| Jon II \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 16| Sansa II \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 17| Arya III \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 18| Samwell I \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 19| Tyrion III \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 20| Catelyn III \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 21| Jaime III \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 22| Arya IV \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 23| Daenerys II \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 24| Bran II \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 25| Davos III \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 26| Jon III \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 27| Daenerys III \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 28| Sansa III \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 29| Arya V \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 30| Jon IV \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 31| Jaime IV \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 32| Tyrion IV \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 33| Samwell II \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 34| Arya VI \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 35| Catelyn IV \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 36| Davos IV \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 37| Jaime V \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 38| Tyrion V \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 39| Arya VII \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 40| Bran III \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 41| Jon V \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 42| Daenerys IV \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 43| Arya VIII \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 44| Jaime VI \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 45| Catelyn V \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 46| Samwell III \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 47| Arya IX \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 48| Jon VI \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 49| Catelyn VI \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 50| Arya X \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 51| Catelyn VII \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 52| Arya XI \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 53| Tyrion VI \t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 54| Davos V\t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 55| Jon VII\t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 56| Bran IV\t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 57| Daenerys V\t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 58| Tyrion VII\t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 59| Sansa IV\t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 60| Tyrion VIII\t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 61| Sansa V\t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 62| Jaime VII\t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 63| Davos VI\t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 64| Jon VIII\t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 65| Arya XII\t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 66| Tyrion IX\t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 67| Jaime VIII\t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 68| Sansa VI\t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 69| Jon IX\t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 70| Tyrion X\t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 71| Daenerys VI\t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 72| Jaime IX\t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 73| Jon X\t\t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 74| Arya XIII\t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 75| Samwell IV\t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 76| Jon XI\t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 77| Tyrion XI\t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 78| Samwell V\t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 79| Jon XII\t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 80| Sansa VII\t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Epilogue| Epilogue\t]]\n# [[A Storm of Swords-Appendix| Appendix        ]]\n}}&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=&quot;background:#F2EEE6;color:#333;border:6px double white;margin:-3px -3px 2px -3px;padding:8px 12px;&quot;&gt;\n\n==\'\'[[A Feast for Crows]]\'\'==\n[[Image:AFeastForCrows.jpg|right|125px|link=A Feast for Crows]]\n\nIt seems too good to be true. After centuries of bitter strife and fatal treachery, the seven powers dividing the land have decimated one another into an uneasy truce. Or so it appears{{nowrap|. . . .}} With the death of the monstrous King Joffrey, his mother Cersei is ruling as regent in King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing. Robb Stark\xe2\x80\x99s demise has broken the back of the Northern rebels, and his siblings are scattered throughout the kingdom like seeds on barren soil. Few legitimate claims to the once desperately sought Iron Throne still exist, or they are held in hands too weak or too distant to wield them effectively. The war, which raged out of control for so long, has burned itself out.\n\nBut as in the aftermath of any climactic struggle, it is not long before the survivors, outlaws, renegades, and carrion eaters start to gather, fighting for the spoils and picking over the bones of the dead. Now in the Seven Kingdoms, as the human crows assemble over a banquet of ashes, daring new plots and dangerous new alliances are formed, while surprising faces&amp;mdash;some familiar, others only just appearing&amp;mdash;are seen emerging from an ominous twilight of past struggles and chaos to take up the challenges ahead.\n\nIt is a time when the wise and the ambitious, the deceitful and the strong will acquire the skills, the power, and the magic to survive the stark and terrible times that lie before them. It is a time for nobles and commoners, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and sages to come together and stake their fortunes {{nowrap|. . .}} and their lives. For at a feast for crows, the guests are many but the survivors are only a few.\n\n{{Clear}} \'\'\'Chapter Summaries\'\'\' | [[Chapters Table of contents#A Feast for Crows|Page Table]].&lt;hr&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n{{Columns|count=6|data =\n&lt;ol start=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;[[A Feast for Crows-Prologue| Prologue\t]]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;\n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 1| The Prophet \t]] \n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 2| The Captain Of Guards]] \t\n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 3| Cersei I \t]] \n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 4| Brienne I \t]] \n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 5| Samwell I \t]] \n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 6| Arya I \t]] \n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 7| Cersei II \t]] \n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 8| Jaime I \t]] \n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 9| Brienne II \t]] \n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 10| Sansa I \t]] \n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 11| The Kraken\'s Daughter]] \t\n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 12| Cersei III \t]] \n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 13| The Soiled Knight]] \t\n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 14| Brienne III \t]] \n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 15| Samwell II \t]] \n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 16| Jaime II \t]] \n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 17| Cersei IV \t]] \n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 18| The Iron Captain]] \t\n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 19| The Drowned Man]] \t\n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 20| Brienne IV \t]] \n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 21| The Queenmaker]] \t\n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 22| Arya II \t]] \n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 23| Alayne I \t]] \n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 24| Cersei V \t]] \n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 25| Brienne V \t]] \n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 26| Samwell III \t]] \n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 27| Jaime III \t]] \n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 28| Cersei VI \t]] \n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 29| The Reaver \t]] \n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 30| Jaime IV\t]] \n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 31| Brienne VI\t]]\n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 32| Cersei VII\t]] \n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 33| Jaime V\t]] \n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 34| Cat Of The Canals]] \n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 35| Samwell IV\t]] \n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 36| Cersei VIII\t]] \n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 37| Brienne VII\t]] \n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 38| Jaime VI\t]] \n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 39| Cersei IX\t]] \n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 40| The Princess In The Tower]] \n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 41| Alayne II\t]] \n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 42| Brienne VIII\t]] \n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 43| Cersei X\t]] \n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 44| Jaime VII\t]] \n# [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 45| Samwell V\t]]\n# [[A Feast for Crows-Appendix| Appendix         ]]\n}}&lt;/div&gt; \n&lt;div style=&quot;background:#F2EEE6;color:#333;border:6px double white;margin:-3px -3px 2px -3px;padding:8px 12px;&quot;&gt;\n\n==\'\'[[A Dance with Dragons]]\'\'== \n[[Image:ADanceWithDragons.jpg|right|125px|link=A Dance with Dragons]]\n\nIn the aftermath of a colossal battle, the future of the Seven Kingdoms hangs in the balance\xe2\x80\x94beset by newly emerging threats from every direction. In the east, Daenerys Targaryen, the last scion of House Targaryen, rules with her three dragons as queen of a city built on dust and death. But Daenerys has thousands of enemies, and many have set out to find her. As they gather, one young man embarks upon his own quest for the queen, with an entirely different goal in mind.\n\nFleeing from Westeros with a price on his head, Tyrion Lannister, too, is making his way to Daenerys. But his newest allies in this quest are not the rag-tag band they seem, and at their heart lies one who could undo Daenerys\xe2\x80\x99s claim to Westeros forever.\nMeanwhile, to the north lies the mammoth Wall of ice and stone\xe2\x80\x94a structure only as strong as those guarding it. There, Jon Snow, 998th Lord Commander of the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch, will face his greatest challenge. For he has powerful foes not only within the Watch but also beyond, in the land of the creatures of ice.\n\nFrom all corners, bitter conflicts reignite, intimate betrayals are perpetrated, and a grand cast of outlaws and priests, soldiers and skinchangers, nobles and slaves, will face seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Some will fail, others will grow in the strength of darkness. But in a time of rising restlessness, the tides of destiny and politics will lead inevitably to the greatest dance of all.\n\n{{Clear}} \'\'\'Chapter Summaries\'\'\' | [[Chapters Table of contents#A Dance with Dragons|Page Table]].&lt;hr&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n{{Columns|count=6|data =\n&lt;ol start=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;[[A Dance with Dragons-Prologue|Prologue]] &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;\n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 1|Tyrion I]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 2|Daenerys I]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 3|Jon I]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 4|Bran I]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 5|Tyrion II]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 6|The Merchant\'s Man]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 7|Jon II]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 8|Tyrion III]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 9|Davos I]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 10|Jon III]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 11|Daenerys II]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 12|Reek I]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 13|Bran II]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 14|Tyrion IV]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 15|Davos II]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 16|Daenerys III]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 17|Jon IV]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 18|Tyrion V]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 19|Davos III]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 20|Reek II]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 21|Jon V]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 22|Tyrion VI]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 23|Daenerys IV]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 24|The Lost Lord]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 25|The Windblown]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 26|The Wayward Bride]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 27|Tyrion VII]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 28|Jon VI]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 29|Davos IV]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 30|Daenerys V]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 31|Melisandre I]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 32|Reek III]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 33|Tyrion VIII]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 34|Bran III]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 35|Jon VII]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 36|Daenerys VI]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 37|The Prince of Winterfell]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 38|The Watcher]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 39|Jon VIII]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 40|Tyrion IX]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 41|The Turncloak]]\n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 42|The King\'s Prize]]\n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 43|Daenerys VII]]\n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 44|Jon IX]]\n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 45|The Blind Girl]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 46|A Ghost in Winterfell]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 47|Tyrion X]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 48|Jaime I]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 49|Jon X]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 50|Daenerys VIII]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 51|Theon I]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 52|Daenerys IX]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 53|Jon XI]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 54|Cersei I]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 55|The Queensguard]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 56|The Iron Suitor]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 57|Tyrion XI]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 58|Jon XII]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 59|The Discarded Knight]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 60|The Spurned Suitor]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 61|The Griffin Reborn]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 62|The Sacrifice]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 63|Victarion I]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 64|The Ugly Little Girl]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 65|Cersei II]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 66|Tyrion XII]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 67|The Kingbreaker]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 68|The Dragontamer]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 69|Jon XIII]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 70|The Queen\'s Hand]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 71|Daenerys X]] \n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Epilogue|Epilogue]]\n# [[A Dance with Dragons-Appendix|Appendix]] \n}}&lt;/div&gt; \n&lt;div style=&quot;background:#F2EEE6;color:#333;border:6px double white;margin:-3px -3px 2px -3px;padding:8px 12px;&quot;&gt;\n\n==\'\'[[The Winds of Winter]]\'\'== \n[[Image:Nocover.png|right|125px|link=The Winds of Winter]]\n\nSeveral chapters of the upcoming book have been released on [[George R.

Qhorin sends [[Stonesnake]] and Jon to dispatch the watchers, and they are warned not to let them sound a horn. Stonesnake teaches Jon how to climb a sheer cliff face, and they eventually reach the top above the [[wildling|wildlings]]. There are three, and after killing two, the third turns out to be a woman, [[Ygritte]]. She yields to them, and Jon takes her captive, despite Stonesnake\xe2\x80\x99s warning that she should be killed. When she learns that Jon is a bastard son of a Stark lord, she tells him the wildling story of [[Bael|Bael the Bard]]. Supposedly, before he joined the free folk, he was a raider, or, according to Stonesnake, a murderer and robber. \n\nLord [[Brandon Stark (the daughterless)|Brandon Stark]] wanted Bael\xe2\x80\x99s head, but was never successful in capturing the bandit. To teach the lord a lesson, Bael slipped into [[Winterfell]] calling himself Bard Sygerrik, which means \xe2\x80\x98deceiver\xe2\x80\x99 in the old tongue of the [[First Men]], which the giants still speak. In return for his performance, he requested the fairest flower in Winterfell, and the lord gave him the rare winter rose. In the morning, the singer was gone along with Lord Brandon\xe2\x80\x99s daughter. \n\nA year later, the lord\xe2\x80\x99s daughter was found in her bedchamber with a young baby. Bael had hidden her in the crypts of Winterfell. Thirty years later when Bael was [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]] and led the wildlings south, it was his son, the new Stark lord, who slew Bael, since the bard would not harm his son. Upon returning home, the young lord\xe2\x80\x99s mother killed herself when she found out Bael was dead. The young lord was said to have eventually been killed by [[House Bolton|one of his bannermen]]. Jon does not believe the story, which claims that the blood of the Starks and the wildlings is the same. \n\nWhen Qhorin and the others arrive, Ygritte recognizes the Halfhand and confirms that the wildlings would kill him if he yielded. Qhorin\xe2\x80\x99s men state that she should be killed, and Qhorin leaves Jon alone with Ygritte to carry out the task. Ygritte tells Jon that [[Mance Rayder]] would accept him if he ran off with her. Jon, about to behead her, finally stops himself and tells her to run off.     \n\n==References and Notes==    \n{{References|2}}\n* [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2012/01/re-read-jon-vi-out-on-climb.html Analyses and summary of the chapter] in the course of a 10th reread by Slynt.\n* [http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/06/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-25 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n* The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n    \n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 51]]    \n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Jon Snow]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Skirling Pass]]\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 51]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 52, Jon]]</text>\n      <sha1>18mbddkvd594s6a8dy0bvqm1wqizgcn</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Game of Thrones-Chapter 38</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6001</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>165981</id>\n      <parentid>108397</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-17T14:19:20Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8059">{{Infobox Chapter AGoT\n| pov\t\t= [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n| place         = The [[Eyrie]]\n| title\t\t= Tyrion V\n| page\t\t= 341\n| previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 37|Bran V]]\n| current\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 38|Tyrion V]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 39|Eddard X]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 31|Tyrion IV]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 42|Tyrion VI]]\n}} __NOTOC__\n\n[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] is held captive in one of the [[Eyrie]]\xe2\x80\x99s [[Sky Cells|sky cells]]. Eventually he bribes the [[Mord|jailer]] to take a message that he is ready to confess. When brought into the high hall, Tyrion manages to convince Lady [[Lysa Arryn]] to give him a trial by combat and the sellsword [[Bronn]] declares he will be Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s champion.\n\n==Synopsis==    \n[[File:MKomarck TyrionSkyCells.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Tyrion in the [[Eyrie|Eyrie\'s]] [[Sky Cells]]]]\n\nThe ugly and sadistic jailer [[Mord]] brings beans for [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]], who is in one of the [[Eyrie]]\xe2\x80\x99s [[Sky Cells|sky cells]]. As always, when Tyrion reaches for the plate, the oaf pulls it away and holds it over the edge of the cell, telling Tyrion to come get it. Tyrion is unwilling to step that close to the edge and Mord lets the plate fall. Tyrion curses Mord, who gives him a kick before he leaves. \n\nTyrion crawls to the corner to huddle under a thin blanket that has replaced the [[shadowcat|shadowskin]] cloak stolen by Mord. Tyrion reflects that he would gladly trade the cold and open sky cell for the dankest pit in [[Casterly Rock]]. When Mord placed Tyrion in the cell he promised that, sooner or later, Tyrion would fly. To make things worse, the floor slants towards the opening, making Tyrion afraid to sleep, lest he slip towards the edge. \n\nTyrion remembers when [[Lysa Arryn]] announced to her court that Tyrion had slain [[Jon Arryn]], the [[Hand of the King]]. That was when Tyrion put his foot in it, remarking \xe2\x80\x9cOh, did I kill him too.\xe2\x80\x9d He went on to wonder aloud when he would have had enough time to do all this killing. He should have been silent but he had been in a foul mood, having been humiliated by having to be carried the last leg of the climb to the Eyrie by [[Bronn]]. Lysa warned him about where he was but he threatened them with the wrath of [[Jaime Lannister]] all the same. He even declared his threat a promise and drove sickly young Lord [[Robert Arryn]] into a frenzy. It was only the intervention of [[Catelyn Stark]] that saved him from being made to fly when she insisted that Tyrion was her prisoner. Then he was sent to the sky cells.\n\nTyrion thought that they would not dare kill him out of hand, but now he is not so sure. He is getting weaker every day and it is only a matter of time before Mord\xe2\x80\x99s kicks do him serious harm. He is sure that [[Tywin Lannister|his father]] will have sent riders out by now and Jaime might already be leading an army to rescue him. [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] might get King [[Robert Baratheon| Robert]] to sit in judgment himself, which even [[Eddard Stark]] could not object to. Tyrion is sure he can win a trial since the [[House Stark|Starks]] have no proof. \n\nTyrion wonders which of his siblings sent the footpad to kill [[Bran Stark]] and if they also conspired in the death of [[Jon Arryn]]. If Arryn was murdered it was subtly done, whereas sending a footpad to kill Bran was unbelievably clumsy. This leads Tyrion to wonder if there is some other force involved that has made him a pawn; Tyrion hates being a pawn.\n\nTyrion decides that he must free himself, and soon. He has no chance of overpowering Mord, so he must talk himself out. Tyrion hammers on the door, yelling for Mord. Mord is furious that Tyrion is making noise. Tyrion, remembering not to show fear, asks if Mord would like to be rich. Mord only strikes him with a leather strap. It takes a great deal of talking about [[House Lannister|Lannister]] gold while getting slapped before Mord finally starts to listen. Tyrion explains that, although she relieved him of his purse, Catelyn Stark would never rob him; therefore the gold is still his. Tyrion promises all of his gold to Mord in exchange for Mord telling Lysa Arryn that he wishes to confess his crimes. Tyrion even goes so far as to lie that his brother [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] wears solid gold plate armor (it is actually gilded steel, but Mord would never know the difference}. When Tyrion senses Mord\xe2\x80\x99s suspicion, he offers to write down the deal and Mord brings him a pen and paper. \n\nTyrion is shivering in his sleep when Ser [[Vardis Egen]] arrives to bring him to Lysa. Before he leaves, Tyrion asks Mord for his shadowskin cloak and Ser Vardis orders the unhappy jailer to hand it over. The High Hall is filled with knights and retainers to hear his confessions. Tyrion is happy to see that young Lord Robert is missing from the high throne. Tyrion is also pleased to see [[Bronn]] and [[Marillion]] among the witnesses; with a singer present, whatever happens will not remain a secret.\n\nLysa comments to her sister that the sky cells always break prisoners, but Catelyn only says that Tyrion does not appear broken to her. Tyrion declares to himself that the time has come to roll the dice. He starts by declaring himself a vile little man and that his crimes and sins are beyond counting: whoring, gambling, wishing his own father and sister dead, and speaking ill of the royal court. Soon he is interrupted by a furious Lysa and Catelyn tells him pointedly that he is there to confess to the attempted murder of [[Bran Stark]] and the murder of Jon Arryn. Tyrion merely replies that he cannot confess to those crimes because he is innocent.\n\nLysa orders Tyrion taken back to a smaller sky cell with a steeper floor. Before he can be taken, Tyrion asks loudly if this is how justice is done in the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]]: he is accused of crimes, he denies them, and so he is thrown into a cell. He makes sure to show his bruised face to the crowd. Tyrion demands a trial where he can defend himself and be judged by gods and men. Lysa states that if Tyrion is found guilty, he will go through the \xe2\x80\x9cmoon door\xe2\x80\x9d, which leads only to a fatal plunge to the mountainside below. Catelyn tells Lysa that this is unwise. Lysa states that her son will hear and judge Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s trial. Tyrion remembers Lord Robert stating that he wanted to see him fly.\n\nTyrion demands a trial-by-combat, which the fills the hall with derisive laughter. There are shouts throughout the hall, with most men asking to be given the honor of championing Lysa Arryn\xe2\x80\x99s cause. Lysa declares that Ser Vardis Egen, the only silent man, will be her champion. Ser Vardis sinks to one knee, but declines the honor, insisting that to slaughter such a defenseless man would be shameful. Tyrion is quick to agree, demanding a champion the same as Lysa and naming his brother [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]. When Lysa refuses Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s choice on the grounds that Jaime is hundreds of leagues away, Tyrion turns to Marillion to insist that when he makes a ballad of these proceedings he be sure to mention that Tyrion was denied a champion and sent bruised and hobbling against Lysa\xe2\x80\x99s finest knight. Lysa tells him to name another champion. For a moment no one moves and Tyrion wonders if he has made a terrible mistake. Then there is a stirring in the back of the chamber, and Bronn calls out that he will stand as champion for Tyrion.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/08/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-19 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/039/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==    \n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 38]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Tyrion Lannister]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in the Eyrie]]\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 38]]\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 39, Tyrion]][[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\xa2\xd0\xb8\xd1\x80\xd0\xb8\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbd V]]</text>\n      <sha1>7evyeeujwoec0op8488eiv6ia23u6q0</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 49</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6886</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>196899</id>\n      <parentid>180377</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2017-01-20T22:28:52Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Nittanian</username>\n        <id>3504</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <minor/>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3822">{{Infobox Chapter ADwD\n| pov\t\t= [[Jon Snow]]\n| place         = [[Castle Black]]\n| title\t\t= Jon X\n| page\t\t= 647\n| previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 48|Jaime I]]\n| current\t= Jon X\n| next\t\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 50|Daenerys VIII]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 44|Jon IX]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 53|Jon XI]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Melisandre]] is conducting the marriage ceremony between [[Alys Karstark]] and [[Sigorn]], the new [[Magnar]] of [[Thenn]]. Only a few brothers of the [[Night\'s Watch]] attend, along with Queen [[Selyse Florent|Selyse]], her queen\'s men, and a few king\'s men that [[Stannis]] left behind. Meanwhile, [[Jon Snow]] has ordered [[Clydas]] to dispatch a raven to [[Deepwood Motte]] in order to warn Stannis of [[Arnolf Karstark]]\'s treachery. &lt;ref&gt;Jon learned from Alys that her uncle Arnolf plans to betray Stannis when his forces engage [[Roose Bolton]]\'s [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 44|Chapter 44 (Jon IX)]]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[Cregan Karstark]] followed his niece Alys to [[Castle Black]] a day after her arrival. Jon met him before he could reach the fortress and imprisoned Cregan and his men in the ice cells at the [[Wall]]. Knowing that Stannis will execute Cregan when he learns of the betrayal, Jon tries to get Cregan to take the black and accept Alys\' claim to Karstark. Cregan won\'t hear about it, but Jon thinks time spent in the ice cell might change his mind. \n\nAt Alys and Sigorn\'s wedding feast, a raven brings message that the relief fleet for [[Hardhome]], delayed due to the bad weather, has now left [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]]. [[Cotter Pyke]] is commanding the fleet and he left behind [[Glendon Hewett]] in charge of Eastwatch. Jon is unsure of Hewett\'s loyalty due to his association with [[Janos Slynt]] and [[Alliser Thorne]]. [[Axell Florent]] once again presses Jon to release the whereabouts of [[Val]], as he intends to marry her, but Jon scoffs at the idea. The wedding feast comes to an abrupt end when a horn is sounded twice, announcing [[wildlings]]. Jon knows that Val has succeeded in her mission, and that [[Tormund Giantsbane]] has come at last.&lt;ref&gt;Jon is expecting an answer for the terms he asked Val to present to Tormund back in [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 39|Chapter 39 (Jon VIII)]]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n* [[Jon Stark]]\n* [[Melisandre]]\n* [[Old Nan]]\n* [[Ghost]]\n* [[Alys Karstark]]\n* [[Selyse Florent]]\n* [[Stannis]]\n* [[Brus Buckler|Ser Brus Buckler]]\n* [[Malegorn of Redpool|Ser Malegorn of Redpool]]\n* [[Narbert Grandison|Ser Narbert Grandison]]\n* [[Patrek of King\'s Mountain|Ser Patrek of King\'s Mountain]]\n* [[Axell Florent]]\n* [[Lambert Whitewater|Ser Lambert Whitewater]]\n* [[Shireen Baratheon]]\n* [[Patchface]]\n* [[Othell Yarwyck]]\n* [[Bowen Marsh]]\n* [[Chayle|Septon Chayle]]\n* [[Satin]]\n* [[Sigorn| Sigorn (Magnar of Thenn)]]\n* [[Cregan Karstark]]\n* [[Ty]]\n* [[Mully]]\n* [[Hobb]]\n* [[Owen the Oaf]]\n* [[Clydas]]\n* [[Arnolf Karstark]]\n* [[Azor Ahai]]\n* [[Mance Rayder]]\n* [[Harrion Karstark]]\n* [[Ramsay Snow]]\n* [[Eddard Stark]]\n* [[Benjen Stark]]\n* [[Torghen Flint|Old Flint]]\n* [[Brandon Norrey|The Norrey]]\n* [[Val]]\n* [[Ulmer]]\n* [[Simon Toyne]]\n* [[Ben (Big Belly)|Big Belly Ben]]\n* [[Wenda|Wenda the White Fawn]]\n* [[Ygritte]]\n* [[Styr]]\n* [[Robb Stark]]\n* [[Leathers]]\n* [[Wun Wun]]\n* [[Harmune|Maester Harmune]]\n* [[Cotter Pyke]]\n* [[Glendon Hewett]]\n* [[Alliser Thorne]]\n* [[Janos Slynt]]\n* [[Roose Bolton]]\n* [[Tormund Giantsbane]]\n}}\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 49]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Jon Snow]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Castle Black]]\n\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 49]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 50, Jon]]</text>\n      <sha1>hstb2ybmf4s6vp184v8cxukkitee5mu</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Clash of Kings-Chapter 15</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6206</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>177788</id>\n      <parentid>166418</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-12-23T16:22:18Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Nittanian</username>\n        <id>3504</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9265">{{Infobox Chapter ACfK\n| pov\t\t= [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n| place         = [[King\'s Landing]]\n| title\t\t= Tyrion III\n| page\t\t= 168\n| previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 14|Arya IV]]\n| current\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 15|Tyrion III]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 16|Bran II]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 8|Tyrion II]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 17|Tyrion IV]]\n}}\nThe [[small council]] discusses [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]\'s declaration that [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]]\'s children are bastards born of incest. Cersei wants the letters suppressed, but [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] and [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] convince her they should treat the letters with contempt whilst spreading their own rumor that Stannis\' [[Shireen Baratheon|daughter]] is illegitimate. Tyrion leaves the council to meet with city\'s smiths to commission an immense chain, then meets with [[Varys]] via a secret passage in a [[Chataya\'s brothel|brothel]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:Jonny Klein Small Council ChamberII.png|thumb|250px|left|Small Council Chamber - by Jonny Klein FFG\xc2\xa9]]\n\n[[Cersei Lannister]] is furious upon learning that [[Stannis Baratheon]] is circulating letters accusing her of incest. The [[small council]] has two copies of the proclamation: one received by [[Maester]] [[Frenken]] at Castle [[Stokeworth]] and a second received by Lord [[Gyles Rosby]]. [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] notes that if Stannis sent letters to them, every other lord in the [[Seven Kingdoms]] has seen a copy. Cersei wants every copy burned so that neither [[Tywin Lannister|her father]] nor [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] learns of them, but [[Tyrion Lannister]] points out copies have likely been sent to [[Harrenhal]] and [[Casterly Rock]] as well and the secret is out. When Cersei rages that she is being accused of incest, adultery, and treason, Tyrion is impressed by her acting skills since he knows the accusations are perfectly true. He points out that such claims are to be expected since Stannis needs a pretext to justify his rebellion. When Cersei insists she will not be called a whore, Tyrion only thinks that Stannis never claimed [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] paid her. \n\nGlancing back over the letter, Tyrion points out the strange words &quot;Done in the [[R\'hllor|Light of the Lord]].&quot; [[Grand Maester]] [[Pycelle]] explains it is a term commonly used in [[Free Cities]], and Littlefinger notes that [[Varys]], who is absent for reasons known only to Tyrion, reported years ago that Stannis\' wife [[Selyse Florent|Selyse]] took up with a [[Melisandre|red priest]]. Tyrion notes that this can be used as propaganda against Stannis.\n\nCersei brings up the accusations again and urges an edict to suppress its dissemination. Tyrion points out that tearing out a man\'s tongue only proves you fear what he might say. When Cersei asks what he proposes, Tyrion suggests they just let people whisper until they grow bored; without proof many will see the letter as Stannis\' pathetic attempt to justify his rebellion. Littlefinger agrees, adding that they should fight fire with fire by spreading a similar rumor that [[Shireen Baratheon]] is a bastard and Stannis a cuckold.\n\nLittlefinger proposes Shireen\'s fool [[Patchface]] should be called the father to make the story more shocking. Pycelle exclaims that Lady Selyse would never bring a fool into her bed, but Littlefinger replies one would have to be a fool to want to bed Selyse. He adds that the fool\'s devotion to the girl, and their similarly mottled, half-frozen faces will enforce the tale. Pycelle protests that Shireen was scarred by [[greyscale]], but Littlefinger notes the smallfolk are not known for their intelligence. Cersei smiles and calls Littlefinger wicked, and he thanks her. Tyrion recommends the news not come from them lest it be seen as the self-serving lie it is, and Littlefinger suggests using whores and pot-shops. \n\nTyrion takes his leave, and when Cersei asks why, he tells her he is having a gift made for Joffrey: a little chain. Cersei retorts that Joffrey has lots of chains and Tyrion cannot buy his love. Tyrion replies that one day Joffrey may treasure this chain above all others.\n\n[[Bronn]] is waiting outside to inform Tyrion the smiths he summoned are waiting in his audience chamber.  Tyrion compliments the sellsword that he almost sounds like a proper courtier and teases that he will be kneeling next. Bronn responds with, &quot;Fuck you, dwarf.&quot; Tyrion counters with, &quot;That\'s [[Shae]]\'s task.&quot; As Bronn escorts him back to the [[Tower of the Hand]], Lady [[Tanda Stokeworth]] hails Tyrion, but he ignores her and gives orders for his litter to be prepared. In his chambers, he finds his timid squire [[Podrick Payne]] laying out his clothing and the [[Hand of the King|Hand]]\'s chain of office. \n\nEntering his audience chamber, Tyrion cuts straight to the point by presenting the assembled smiths with three links of an immense chain and commanding them to make a thousand more. He orders every forge and every metalworker in the city put to work making and joining more links, and puts Goodman [[Ironbelly]] in charge of seeing it done. The smiths immediately ask about the queen\'s orders for armor and weapons, and her threat of crushed hands for missed quotas.  Tyrion assures them no hands will be crushed, thinking of the love Cersei is creating for them among the smallfolk. Ironbelly asks about supplies of iron and coke, and Tyrion promises Lord Baelish will see they have enough coin while the [[City Watch of King\'s Landing|City Watch]] will help them find and melt down every horseshoe in the city for iron if required. Then an older smith, [[Salloreon]], complains that such work is only fit for common smiths, not master armorers like himself. He offers to make Tyrion a terrifying suit of plate instead, but Tyrion replies that he can either make chains or wear them, and then departs.\n\nOutside, Bronn waits with a litter and an escort of [[Black Ears]]. As he travels, \nTyrion muses that he has set hundreds of carpenters to building fishing boats instead of catapults, opened the [[kingswood]] to hunters, and even sent gold cloaks foraging to deal with hunger in the city, but people still give him accusing looks. He also reflects that Cersei missed the importance of Stannis declaring himself king, and wonders what [[Renly Baratheon]] will make of it. Peering out into the streets he wonders who the informers in the crowd are, and decides they are likely the most innocent-looking ones.\n\n[[File:Chatayas.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Chataya\'s brothel - by Bjarne Hansen\xc2\xa9]]\n[[File:Chataya and Alayaya.jpg|thumb|170px|right|Chataya and Alayaya \xe2\x80\x93 by Amok\xc2\xa9]]\n\nHis destination is a two-story [[Chataya\'s brothel|brothel]] behind [[Rhaenys\'s Hill]]. Inside, he is greeted by a tall, black-skinned woman who names herself [[Chataya]]. When Tyrion asks to see the girls, Chataya recommends a dark-skinned girl of 16 who turns out to be her daughter [[Alayaya]]; in the [[Summer Isles]] being a whore is considered an honor and pleasing to the gods. Tyrion wonders what the gods have to do with it, and jests that he would be much more religious if he could pray with his cock.\n\nLeading Tyrion upstairs to the turret room, Alayaya directs him into a wardrobe, where he finds a secret panel and beyond that a hidden shaft leading down to an underground tunnel where Varys waits in disguise. Tyrion asks if Chataya can be trusted, and Varys explains she has no love for the queen and is grateful to be rid of [[Allar Deem]]. When Tyrion asks how the brothel came to have a secret entrance, Varys explains that the tunnel was dug for another Hand who would not enter the house openly.\n\nEmerging into a stable, Varys helps disguise Tyrion as child and saddle a horse. Tyrion tells him that Stannis has accused Jaime and Cersei of incest, and asks how he came by that suspicion. Varys responds that perhaps someone whispered it to him, or else he simply looked at color of a bastard\'s hair as [[Jon Arryn]] and [[Eddard Stark]] did; after all, each of the eight bastards of King [[Robert I Baratheon|Robert]] that Varys knows had black hair regardless of their mother\'s color. Tyrion wonders if the whisper might have come from Littlefinger, but Varys refuses to confirm. After Varys helps him mount, Tyrion declares to Varys that he is either his best friend or his worst enemy. Varys replies that he feels quite the same about Tyrion.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n*Analyses and summary of the chapter [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2011/07/re-read-tyrion-iii-tyrion-lannister-and.html in the course of a 10th reread] by Slynt.\xc2\xa0\n*[http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2010/08/arya-tyrion.html Humorous review and summary of the chapter] by Jason.\xc2\xa0\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/02/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-7 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 15]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Tyrion Lannister]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in King\'s Landing]]\n\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 16, Tyrion]]\n[[zh:&amp;#21015;&amp;#29579;&amp;#30340;&amp;#32439;&amp;#20105;-&amp;#31456;&amp;#33410; 15]]</text>\n      <sha1>oatsw5weg0fn79k9t06uydka23thj8x</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 51</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5666</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166898</id>\n      <parentid>143422</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-06-04T15:32:29Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Frernok</username>\n        <id>5007</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <comment>/*References and Notes*/</comment>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5569">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Catelyn Tully|Catelyn]]\n| title\t\t= Catelyn VII\n| place         = [[the Twins]]\n| page\t\t= 574\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 50|Arya X]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 51|Catelyn VII]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 52|Arya XI]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 49|Catelyn VI]]\n| arc next\t=\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Catelyn Tully|Catelyn]] listens to the continuous pounding noise of the drums the musicians in the hall are playing. She is seated between [[Ryman Frey]] and [[Roose Bolton]] during the wedding feast. She remarks to herself how joyless the wedding is, and watches as [[Robb Stark|Robb]] dances with several of the Frey maids and [[Edmure Tully|Edmure]] dotes on his soon to be wife, [[Roslin Frey|Roslin]]. Catelyn becomes more wary when she learns that [[Olyvar Frey|Olyvar]], [[Perwyn Frey|Perwyn]], and [[Alesander Frey]] are all not in attendance at the wedding. She notices [[Merrett Frey]] trying to drink the [[Greatjon Umber|Greatjon]] under the table, and finally Lord [[Walder Frey]] calls for the bedding. Robb does not participate as the Greatjon carries a weeping Roslin to the bed chamber.\n\n[[File:A Price of Honor nejna.png|left|250px|thumb|The deaths of Robb, Catelyn, and Jinglebell - by nejna \xc2\xa9]]\nSuddenly, things grow more ominous in the hall as [[Dacey Mormont]] goes up to [[Edwyn Frey]] and asks him if he wants to dance, but he pushes her away violently. The musicians begin to play a new song, which Catelyn recognises to her horror as &quot;[[The Rains of Castamere]]&quot; and sees Edwyn leaving. She takes off after him, and when she grabs his arm, she feels the rings of chain mail beneath. Suddenly, it all makes sense to her; the Freys missing from the wedding and Roslin crying. \n\nThe musicians turn out to be crossbowmen, and the wedding becomes a slaughter. Catelyn watches in horror as a crossbow bolt pierces Robb\'s shoulder and another his leg, and he topples over. [[Jon Umber (Smalljon)|Smalljon]] throws a table over him to save him from three more bolts. [[Robin Flint]] is surrounded by Freys, their daggers rising and falling. Ser [[Wendel Manderly]] is felled by a quarrel through the mouth. Smalljon bludgeons Ser [[Raymund Frey]] across the face with a leg of mutton, but when he reaches for his swordbelt, a crossbow bolt drives him to his knees. [[Lucas Blackwood]] is cut down by Ser [[Hosteen Frey]]. One of the Vances is hamstrung by [[Black Walder]] as he wrestles with Ser [[Harys Haigh]]. Crossbows take [[Donnel Locke]], [[Owen Norrey]], and half a dozen more. Young Ser [[Benfrey Frey]] seizes Dacey Mormont by the arm, who smashes him in the face with a wine flagon. She runs for the door, but Ser Ryman comes through with Frey men-at-arms and sinks his axe into Dacey\'s stomach.\n\nNorthmen begin pouring through the other door, and Catelyn takes them for rescue for half a heartbeat, until one of them decapitates Smalljon. Catelyn realizes that she must try to intervene and save her son\xe2\x80\x99s life, she sees a dagger on the floor and crawls toward it, determined to kill Lord Walder. Then Robb stumbles to his feet, an arrow in his chest in addition to the other two. Lord Walder who, in the midst of slaughter, sits on his throne watching greedily, signals a halt to the music and mocks Robb. Catelyn grabs [[Aegon Frey (Jinglebell)|Jinglebell Frey]] and puts a dagger to the halfwit\xe2\x80\x99s throat. She begs Walder to spare her son, trade a son for a son. But the old man says, &quot;that\'s a grandson... and he never was much use.&quot;\n\nA man in dark armor and a pale pink cloak spotted with blood steps up to Robb, saying &quot;Jaime Lannister sends his regards.&quot; He thrusts his longsword through Robb\'s heart, and twists. Catelyn keeps her promise and slits the poor halfwit\'s throat, and then begins to laugh and shout, while someone says, &quot;she\xe2\x80\x99s lost her wits,&quot;. Someone else says, &quot;Make an end,&quot; she is grabbed from behind and feels steel drawn across her own throat.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n* [[Catelyn Tully]]\n* [[Ryman Frey]]\n* [[Roose Bolton]]\n* [[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Edmure Tully]]\n*[[Roslin Frey]]\n*[[Olyvar Frey]]\n*[[Perwyn Frey]]\n*[[Alesander Frey]]\n*[[Merrett Frey]]\n*[[Jon Umber|Greatjon]]\n*[[Walder Frey]]\n*[[Dacey Mormont]]\n*[[Edwyn Frey]]\n*[[Jon Umber|Smalljon]] \n*[[Wendel Manderly]]\n*[[Robin Flint]]\n*[[Raymund Frey]]\n*[[Lucas Blackwood]]\n*[[Hosteen Frey]]\n*[[Black Walder]]\n*[[Harys Haigh]]\n*[[Donnel Locke]]\n*[[Owen Norrey]]\n*[[Benfrey Frey]]\n*[[Aegon Frey]] Jinglebell\n}}\n\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[The Rains of Castamere]]\n*[[House Lannister]]\n*[[House Frey]]\n}}\n\n\n==References and Notes==\n*The synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/05/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-30 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Part 30].

After the meeting, [[Jory Cassel]] reports to Ned on interviews with [[Jon Arryn]]\xe2\x80\x99s remaining household. The report includes mention of visits by Lord Arryn and [[Stannis Baratheon]] to a [[Chataya\'s brothel|brothel]] and an [[Tobho Mott|armorer]]. Ned orders Jory to identify the brothel and goes to visit the armorer himself. There he discovers an apprentice named [[Gendry]] who looks astonishingly like King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n[[Eddard Stark|Ned]] and the [[small council]] hear [[City Watch of King\'s Landing|City Watch]] Commander [[Janos Slynt]]\xe2\x80\x99s report about the significant increase in crime caused by the influx of people arriving for the upcoming tourney. Slynt requests more men. Ned agrees to hire fifty new watchmen, setting [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] to arrange the monetary details. When Littlefinger objects, Ned insists that since he found 40,000 [[currency|gold dragons]] for the champion\xe2\x80\x99s purse, he should be able to scrape together a few coppers to keep the King\xe2\x80\x99s Peace. Ned also loans Slynt twenty of his own household guard.\n\nNed complains again about the tourney, still irritated that it is to be called &quot;[[the Hand\'s tourney]]&quot; despite his distaste. Moreover, King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] still insists that Ned should feel honored. Grand [[Maester]] [[Pycelle]] points out that a tourney is good for the realm because it brings the great an opportunity for glory and the lowly a respite from their woes. Littlefinger adds that it brings in lots of money, emphasizing full inns and whores walking bowlegged. Lord [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]] laughs, telling how his brother [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] once proposed outlawing brothels, prompting Robert to ask if he wanted to outlaw eating, shitting, and breathing as well. Renly goes on to wonder how Stannis ever fathered his [[Shireen Baratheon|daughter]] when he goes to his marriage bed like he is marching to a battlefield to do his duty. Everyone laughs except Ned, who is preoccupied by thoughts of when Stannis will return and assume his [[Master of Ships|duties]] on the council.\n\nAfter the council adjourns, Ned returns to the [[Tower of the Hand]] and summons [[Jory Cassel]]. As he waits for his horse to be saddled, Ned peruses the book that [[Jon Arryn]] had been reading prior to his death: \'\'[[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms, With Descriptions of Many High Lords and Noble Ladies and Their Children|Lineages of the Great Houses]]\'\' by Grand Maester [[Malleon]]. Its reading has proven extremely tedious, just as Pycelle warned, and scarcely a man now alive had been born when it was written, but Ned is sure [[Jon Arryn]] had a reason for reading it. As he browses the section on [[House Lannister]], Ned muses on their long history and the myths of their ancestor [[Lann the Clever]], who stole gold from the sun to brighten his curly hair.\n\nJory arrives and briefs Ned on his interview with one of Jon Arryn\xe2\x80\x99s stableboys, the last of the four leads provided by Littlefinger. Ser [[Hugh]] proved brusque, arrogant, and uninformative. The serving girl could only say that Jon Arryn had been reading too much, concerned about his [[Robert Arryn|son]]\xe2\x80\x99s frailty, and gruff with his [[Lysa Arryn|wife]]. Meanwhile, the pot boy was only able to provide lots of kitchen gossip, including that Lord Stannis had accompanied Lord Arryn to meet an [[Tobho Mott|armorer]] about elaborate new armor. The stableboy proves just as informative. He swears that Lord Arryn was as strong as a man half his age and often went riding with Lord Stannis. This Ned finds strange; as far as he knew, Jon and Stannis were never friendly. Jory says that the stableboy also claims that Stannis and Jon Arryn visited a brothel together. Unfortunately, the boy did not know which brothel; only the guards that escorted them would know, and they were taken back to the [[Eyrie]] with Lady [[Lysa Arryn|Lysa]]. \n\nThat Stannis would visit a brothel is very strange because he is so stern and humorless. That Stannis\xe2\x80\x99 name keeps coming up and that he has left the city with no word about when he will return also vexes Ned. He wonders why Stannis would leave and decides that something must have frightened him, yet Ned cannot imagine what could have frightened Stannis, who withstood the year-long [[Siege of Storm\'s End]] by surviving on rats and boot leather. Both Ned and Jory find it frustrating that that everyone that might know the truth is a thousand leagues away. When Jory asks if he will call Stannis back from [[Dragonstone]], Ned says not yet.\n\nNed plans to visit the armorer himself and decides to wear his doublet with the direwolf sigil so the armorer will know who he is. As Jory dresses him, Ned wonders why Renly was not invited on the rides. Ned does not know what to make of Renly with his friendly ways and easy smiles. A few days back, Renly showed him a locket with a picture of [[Margaery Tyrell]]. He asked Ned if she resembled [[Lyanna Stark|Lyanna]] and seemed disappointed when Ned shrugged. Ned finds it queer that Renly, who looks so much like [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]], would be obsessed with a lady that he thought looked like Lyanna. \n\nNed tells Jory that it would be good if Stannis returned for the tourney, but Jory\xe2\x80\x99s response makes Ned more certain that Stannis will not. He also wonders why Lord Arryn would be interested in showy armor when he had always considered armor something for protection, not ornament. Ned then tells Jory that he better start visiting brothels, which Jory jokingly calls a \xe2\x80\x9chard duty.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe streets of [[King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing]] are crowded, but Ned and his guardsmen [[Varly]] and [[Jacks]] make it through the crowd to the [[Mud Gate]] where Lord [[Beric Dondarrion]] is arriving with his retinue to participate in the Tourney of the Hand. At the [[Visenya\'s Hill|top]] of the [[Street of Steel]] they find the huge house of the armorer [[Tobho Mott]]. After shouldering his way in, a serving girl notices Ned\xe2\x80\x99s sigil and badge of office and Tobho Mott quickly appears, offering wine. Mott immediately tells Ned that his prices are not cheap but his craftsmanship in unequaled in the [[Seven Kingdoms]]. He adds proudly that [[Loras Tyrell|the Knight of Flowers]] buys all his armor from him and that he can work [[Valyrian steel]]. \n\n[[File:Ryan Barger City of Secrets.JPG|thumb|350px|left|Gendry, the apprentice armorer - Ryan Barger. \xc2\xa9 Fantasy Flight Games.]]\n\nNed lets the armorer go on for a while before he asks if Jon Arryn bought a falcon helm from him. Mott says that Lord Arryn bought nothing, only wanting to see the apprentice boy named [[Gendry]]. Any hint of friendliness leaves Mott when Ned asks to see the boy as well. In the hot stone barn that contains the forges, the armorer introduces Gendry and shows Ned a helmet that the boy has crafted. Ned notes that the unfinished helm is expertly shaped and offers to buy it. Gendry immediately grabs the helmet back, insisting it is not for sale. Mott rushes to offer apologies for Gendry\xe2\x80\x99s behavior, but Ned states there is nothing to forgive. \n\nNed asks Gendry what he and Jon Arryn talked about. Gendry explains that Lord Arryn asked about his age, if he was well treated, and about his mother. Ned asks about the boy\xe2\x80\x99s mother as well, and is told that she is dead, but that she was an alehouse wench with blonde hair. Ned examines Gendry and notices a remarkable resemblance to a younger King Robert, especially his black hair and blue eyes.\n\nNed asks Mott who paid the boy\xe2\x80\x99s apprentice fee. Mott claims he took the boy on for free since he was so strong. Ned does not believe this for a moment. Mott admits that an unknown lord had paid twice the normal apprentice fee for Gendry and said the extra money was for his silence. Ned decides he likes Tobho Mott. Before he leaves, Ned tells Mott to send Gendry to him if the day comes that he wants to wield a sword instead of forge one. Ned also quips that if he ever wants a helm to frighten children, this will be the first place he visits. \n\nAs he rejoins his guards outside, Ned still doesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand what Jon Arryn wanted with a king\xe2\x80\x99s bastard, nor why it led to his death.\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n*[[Varys]]\n*[[Renly Baratheon]]\n*[[Petyr Baelish]]\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n*[[Janos Slynt]]\n*Maester [[Pycelle]]\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Harwin]]\n*[[Jory Cassel]]\n*[[Varly]]\n*[[Jacks]]\n*[[Beric Dondarrion]]\n*[[Tobho Mott]]\n*[[Gendry]]\n\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Aegon I Targaryen]]\n*[[Stannis Baratheon]]\n*[[Hullen]]\n*[[Catelyn Stark]]\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Bran Stark]]\n*[[Jon Snow]]\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*Maester [[Malleon]]\n*[[Jon Arryn]]\n*[[House Lannister]]\n*[[Lann the Clever]]\n*[[Bran the Builder]]\n*[[House Casterly]]\n*[[Alyn]]\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*Ser [[Hugh]]\n*[[Lysa Arryn]]\n*[[Robert Arryn]]\n*Maester [[Colemon]]\n*[[Mace Tyrell]]\n*[[Loras Tyrell]]\n*[[Margaery Tyrell]]\n*[[Lyanna Stark]]\n*[[Porther]]\n*[[Tomard]]\n*[[Desmond]]\n|}\n==Terms and places mentioned==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[King\'s Landing]]\n*[[Great Sept]]\n*[[Tower of the Hand]]\n*[[Red Keep]]\n*[[River Gate]]\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Dragonstone]]\n*[[Casterly Rock]]\n*[[Winterfell]]\n*[[Eyrie]]\n*[[Storm\'s End]]\n*[[Qohor]]\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[City Watch]]\n*[[Age of Heroes]]\n|}\n\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Items and events:\'\'\'\n*[[The Hand\'s tourney]]\n*[[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms]]\n*[[Valyrian steel]]\n|}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/07/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-14 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/028/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 27]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Eddard Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in King\'s Landing]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 27]]\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 28, Eddard]]\n[[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\xad\xd0\xb4\xd0\xb4\xd0\xb0\xd1\x80\xd0\xb4 VI]]</text>\n      <sha1>heekileanvv9j3gsv18wd08dncn5tra</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Clash of Kings-Chapter 22</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5673</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166425</id>\n      <parentid>155666</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-23T20:48:17Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13115">{{Infobox Chapter ACfK\n| pov\t\t= [[Catelyn Tully]]\n| place         = [[Bitterbridge]]\n| title\t\t= Catelyn II\n| page\t\t= 245\n| previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 21|Bran III]]\n| current\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 22|Catelyn II]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 23|Jon III]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 7|Catelyn I]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 31|Catelyn III]]\n}}\n\nAs envoy to King [[Renly Baratheon]], [[Catelyn Tully|Catelyn]] arrives at [[Bitterbridge]] to find [[melee at Bitterbridge|a great melee]] in progress. Afterward, the champion [[Brienne of Tarth]] is granted her request to become one of Renly\'s [[Rainbow Guard]]. That night Catelyn attends a feast and meets privately with Renly, who insists [[Robb Stark|Robb]] must bend the knee to him. Then, a messenger arrives with news that King [[Stannis Baratheon]] has besieged [[Storm\'s End]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nA cruel dawn wakes [[Catelyn Tully|Catelyn]] from sweet dreams of happy family life. She is weary of riding, hurting, and being strong, but she knows she cannot allow herself to be weak today. Outside her tent, she finds [[Shadd]] stirring oats into a kettle. Ser [[Wendel Manderly]] suggests supplementing this with roast quail, but Catelyn decides oats and bread are sufficient since they have many leagues to travel. \n\nHer party includes twenty of [[Robb Stark|Robb]]\'s best [[Winterfell]] men and five lordlings, including Ser Wendel, Ser [[Perwyn Frey]], [[Lucas Blackwood]], and [[Robin Flint]], to add weight and honor to her negotiations with King [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]]. It is a mission Catelyn never wanted, but Robb insisted he had no one else: Lord [[Hoster Tully]] was too ill, and he needed Ser [[Brynden Tully]] to command his scouts and Ser [[Edmure Tully]] to hold [[Riverrun]] when he marched. Catelyn argued that marching was rash, but Robb insisted waiting would make him look afraid and weaken his position, especially since [[Lysa Arryn]] will not support him. Catelyn feared he planned to play into [[Tywin Lannister]]\'s hand and march on [[Harrenhal]], but Robb countered that he said nothing of Harrenhal. Catelyn smiles at the memory of Robb\'s obvious ploy of threatening to send [[Greatjon Umber]] in her place, given how ill-suited the Greatjon is to treat with a man like Renly. Before leaving, she wrote to [[Bran Stark|Bran]] and [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]] and visited her father but he mistook her for [[Minisa Whent|her mother]].\n\nHalf a day\'s ride from Renly\'s camp they are spotted from a windmill and intercepted by Ser [[Colen of Greenpools]] with twenty men. When Catelyn announces herself as the envoy of the [[King in the North]], Ser Colen insists that Renly is king of all the [[Seven Kingdoms]] and escorts her to his camp at [[Bitterbridge]], where the [[roseroad]] crosses the [[Mander]]. With nearly all the chivalry of the south behind him, Renly\'s camp is immense. Thousands of cookfires cloud the air and a vast menagerie of banners fly from a veritable forest of staffs. Monstrous siege engines line the road, tents and pavilions dot the landscape, and the whole place bustles with people. Everywhere Catelyn sees the golden rose of [[House Tyrell]] and across the river Renly and his [[Stormlands|storm lords]] have raised their own standards. Catelyn recognizes many of the sigils, but for each one she knows there are a dozen she does not, all assembled to make Renly a king.\n\nPassing through a line of pavilions, they come upon [[melee at Bitterbridge|a tourney melee]] taking place beneath the battlements of a small castle. Less than a score of contestants remain ahorse, cheered on by hundreds of spectators. Since penetrating the crowd proves difficult, Ser Colen asks that Catelyn\'s escort wait while he presents her to the king. A roar goes up when a knight of [[House Tarth]] in cobalt armor unhorses [[Ronnet Connington|Red Ronnet Connington]], but the carnage makes Catelyn think it mad for Renly to be playing at war with real enemies all around.\n\nAmong the lords and ladies in the gallery, Catelyn recognizes stout Lord [[Mathis Rowan]], delicate Lady [[Arwyn Oakheart]], and martial Lord [[Randyll Tarly]], but others she knows only by sigil or not at all. The handsome King Renly sits in their midst, looking like a youthful ghost of his brother [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] and laughing with his young queen [[Margaery Tyrell]], a girl of Robb\'s age with a shy smile and curly brown hair. Catelyn knows their marriage is the mortar of the great southron alliance, and the rose sigil and green-and-gold colors of House Tyrell are prominent in Renly\'s slender crown and velvet tunic.\n\n[[File:Acok brienne by o0magnus.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Brienne of Tarth defeats two attackers.]]\n\nOut on the field, only four men remain and both king and commons obviously favor young Ser [[Loras Tyrell]] in his silver mail and rainbow cloak. Two others ally against the blue-clad knight from Tarth but are quickly unhorsed. Forced to discard his now-broken shield for the final duel, the blue knight is at a disadvantage and soon disarmed by Ser Loras. Yet as Loras prepares the final blow, the blue knight charges into it, grapples him to the ground, and opens Tyrell\'s visor with a dirk to make him to yield.\n\nAs the blue knight salutes the king in victory, squires rush to help Loras Tyrell remove his helm and Catelyn is startled by his youth and beauty. Renly then bids the champion to approach and there are a few cries of &quot;Tarth!&quot; and, oddly, &quot;A Beauty!&quot; but most remain silent. Renly declares the blue knight to be all his father claimed since Loras is rarely unhorsed, but Catelyn overhears accusations of trickery from the crowd. When she asks why the man in blue is so disliked, Ser Colen explains that the champion is no man but [[Brienne of Tarth]], the daughter of Lord [[Selwyn Tarth|Selwyn the Evenstar]], who is often called &quot;Brienne the Beauty,&quot; though never to her face.\n\n[[File:Brienne by quickreaver.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Brienne of Tarth - \xc2\xa9FFG]]\n\nKing Renly officially declares Brienne the champion as the last mounted of 116 knights and offers her any reward within his power. Brienne asks to be made one of his seven [[Rainbow Guard]] and Renly agrees. It is only when Brienne removes her greathelm that Catelyn understands Ser Colen\'s words: the only thing beautiful about Brienne are her girlish blue eyes. Her face is broad, coarse, and freckled, with a large mouth full of crooked teeth and a nose that has been broken more than once. Catelyn is filled with pity for the girl, yet Brienne looks anything but unfortunate when Renly fastens the rainbow cloak to her shoulders, and her face lights up with a smile as she proudly pledges to give her life for him.\n \nSer Colen interjects to introduce Catelyn, though she needs to insist that Robb is King in the North as well as Lord of Winterfell. Renly looks surprised, but greets her warmly and introduces his queen, who offers condolences for her husband\'s death. Renly even swears to bring her [[Cersei Lannister]]\'s head when he takes [[King\'s Landing]], but Catelyn replies that justice will be enough. Brienne of Tarth notes that Catelyn should kneel and refer to the king as &quot;Your Grace,&quot; but Catelyn insists they have more pressing matters to discuss. Some of Renly\'s lords bristle, but the king only laughs and asks when Robb plans to march on Harrenhal. Unsure whether Renly will be a friend or a foe, Catelyn only replies that she does not sit on the war council. Renly asks about [[Jaime Lannister]] and, learning he is a prisoner, declares that the direwolf is gentler than the lion. Lord Randyll Tarly pipes up that Robb should have come to pay homage in person, but Catelyn counters that her son is fighting a war, not playing at one. Renly grins and warns Lord Tarly that he is outmatched, then offers Catelyn the use of his own pavilion (since he is guesting at Lord [[Lorent Caswell]]\'s castle) and invites her to the evening\'s farewell feast.\n\nRenly\'s pavilion is so massive and richly furnished that Catelyn understands why his host moves so slowly, and that evening she is seated between Mathis Rowan and Ser [[Jon Fossoway]]. Meanwhile, Brienne of Tarth is seated at the far end of the high table in knight\'s garments instead of a lady\'s and Catelyn notes that out of her armor Brienne looks muscular, plain, and ungainly, and judges from the woman\'s actions that she knows it.\n\n[[File:Renly Baratheon.jpg|thumb|250px|right|King Renly Baratheon - by Amok\xc2\xa9]]\n\nSingers and tumblers entertain them, and the food is rich and plentiful, but Catelyn eats only sparingly and watches those around her. King Renly speaks amiably to all and sometimes feeds Queen Margaery choice morsels or kisses her lightly, but it is Ser Loras who shares most in his jests and confidences. Others are less moderate: the brothers [[Josua Willum|Josua]] and [[Elyas Willum]] dispute who will be first over the walls of King\'s Landing, Lord [[House Varner|Varner]] dandles a serving girl, Ser [[Guyard Morrigen]] sings a bad song about knotting lions\' tails, Ser [[Mark Mullendore]] feeds his pet monkey from his plate, and Ser [[Tanton Fossoway]] climbs onto the table and swears to slay [[Sandor Clegane]] in single combat.\n\nWhen a gold-dressed fool and a dwarf elicit gales of laughter by mocking Jaime and [[Tyrion Lannister]], Lord Rowan remarks to Catelyn that Renly and his favorites are all very young. Seeing Lord [[Bryce Caron]] goad Ser [[Robar Royce]] into juggling daggers, Catelyn recalls that none of them are old enough to have seen war, so they think it is a game and believe themselves immortal. She tells Lord Rowan that war will make them old, as it did her generation, and says she pities them because they are the knights of summer and winter is coming. Brienne chimes in to disagree, saying: {{Quote|Winter will never come for the likes of us. Should we die in battle, they will surely sing of us, and it\xe2\x80\x99s always summer in the songs. In the songs all knights are gallant, all maids are beautiful, and the sun is always shining.}} Catelyn knows that winter comes for everyone, as it did for her when Ned died, but King Renly saves her from having to say so by asking her to take the air with him. Brienne wants to come along as well, but Renly insists another sword will make no difference in the midst of his own army. Brienne seems very hurt by the refusal. \n\nAs they walk, Renly asks if Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] has joined Robb at Riverrun. When Catelyn seems puzzled, Renly tells her of Selmy\'s dismissal and his vow to serve the true king, adding that Brienne\'s position in the Rainbow Guard was meant for Selmy. Next, Renly explains that he offered Ned a hundred swords to seize Joffrey but fled when refused because he lacked the strength to act alone and feared Cersei meant to kill him after Robert died. He adds that he liked Ned well enough and knew him to be Robert\'s loyal friend, but says Ned would not listen or bend. \n\nLeading her out onto the roof, Renly shows Catelyn his army\'s countless campfires and asks how many fires burn around Riverrun. He guesses that Robb has 40,000 men at most, though Catelyn knows the real number is much lower. Renly declares that he has twice as many with him, and another 10,000 with [[Mace Tyrell]] at Highgarden, a strong garrison at [[Storm\'s End]], and soon all the power of [[Dorne]] and his brother [[Stannis Baratheon]] on [[Dragonstone]]. Catelyn counters sharply that Renly seems to have forgotten that Stannis has the better claim. Renly replies that Stannis is respected and feared but not loved and would make an appalling king. Gesturing to his army, Renly declares that his claim is as good as Robert\'s ever was. \n\nThen he offers terms: Robb can rule in Winterfell and even go on calling himself King in the North, but he must bend the knee to Renly as his overlord. When Catelyn asks the consequences of refusal, Renly insists he means to be king of a united realm and reminds her that [[Torrhen Stark]] was wise to yield to [[Aegon I Targaryen]], adding that if they join together the war is good as done.\n\nJust then, a messenger rides into the yard with news that [[Storm\'s End]] is under attack, although Ser [[Cortnay Penrose]] defies the besiegers. When Renly protests that he would know if Lord Tywin had left Harrenhal, the messenger replies that these are no Lannisters; it Lord Stannis at the gates, calling himself \'\'King\'\' Stannis.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n*Analyses and summary of the chapter [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2011/10/re-read-catelyn-ii-host-of-hundreds-and.html in the course of a 10th reread] by Slynt. \n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/03/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-11 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 22]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Catelyn Tully]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in the Riverlands]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Bitterbridge]]\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 22]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 23, Catelyn]]</text>\n      <sha1>d0ynn8ma9y15wq5dkweqm9t3qf4ln4n</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Game of Thrones-Chapter 4</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>3393</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>183410</id>\n      <parentid>165939</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-04-28T19:11:07Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7276">{{Infobox Chapter AGoT\n| pov\t\t= [[Eddard Stark]]\n| place         = [[Winterfell]]\n| title\t\t= Eddard I\n| page\t\t= \n| previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 3|Daenerys I]]\n| current\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 4|Eddard I]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 5|Jon I]]\n| arc previous\t= \n| arc next\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 12|Eddard II]]\n}} __NOTOC__\n\nKing [[Robert Baratheon]] arrives at [[Winterfell]] to offer [[Eddard Stark|Ned]] the position of [[Hand of the King]] and the opportunity for Ned\'s daughter [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] to marry the crown prince [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe king\'s party, three hundred strong, rides into [[Winterfell]]. Ned recognizes [[Jaime Lannister]], [[Tyrion Lannister]], Crown Prince [[Joffrey]], and [[Sandor Clegane]] but doesn\'t recognize his old friend King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] until Robert calls out.  Ned is shocked to see that Robert--a huge, bearded man flanked by two knights of the [[Kingsguard]]--has gained 8 stone (112 lbs) since they last saw each other nine years ago during the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]]. Ned pays obeisance as Queen [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] and the younger children debark from the wheelhouse. After the formalities of greeting, including the introduction of children from both parties, Robert insists on being taken down to the crypts where the dead of [[House Stark]] are buried to pay his respects. Queen Cersei objects but is totally disregarded.\n\nNed asks Robert about his journey and Robert complains of the distance that has to be traveled in the vast emptiness of [[the North]]. Robert then describes the advantages of living in the south, telling Ned he has to see the wonders, the warmth, and the undress of the women. \n\n[[File:Ned and Robert at tomb.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Robert visits Lyanna Stark\xe2\x80\x99s crypt.]]\n\nThey descend into the crypt, which is an effort for the out-of-shape Robert. Robert wants to visit the tomb of Ned\'s sister [[Lyanna Stark]], who was his betrothed. They pass the dead of House Stark with statues in front of the crypts, each lord holding a sword on his lap with a [[direwolf]] at his feet. They arrive at the last of the occupied crypts. Here there are three tombs for Ned\xe2\x80\x99s father [[Rickard Stark|Lord Rickard]], his elder brother [[Brandon Stark|Brandon]], and his sister Lyanna. Robert declares that Ned should have buried Lyanna on a sunny hillside, but Ned explains that she was a Stark of Winterfell and belongs here as was her wish. Ned remembers her dying, with only he and his friend [[Howland Reed]] nearby, while Robert recalls taking his vengeance on [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] for what he did to Lyanna, regretting that he only got to kill him once. Ned suggests that they should return to the surface where Robert\'s wife will be waiting. Robert replies that the [[Others]] can take his wife, but they start back all the same.\n\nAs they return, Ned asks about [[Jon Arryn]] and Robert declares that he has never seen a man die so quickly: from healthy to dead within a fortnight. Ned asks how Jon\'s widow [[Lysa Arryn|Lysa]] is bearing her grief, explaining that [[Catelyn Tully|Catelyn]] fears for her sister. Robert confides that he thinks Jon\xe2\x80\x99s death has driven Lysa mad and that she has taken [[Robert Arryn|her son]] back to the [[Eyrie]]. Robert had hoped to foster the sickly boy with [[Tywin Lannister]], but Lysa refused to hear of it and left in the dead of night; Cersei was furious. Ned, who does not trust Tywin, is relieved. Ned asks to foster Robert Arryn himself, but Tywin has already agreed and Ned taking him as a ward would be an insult to Tywin.\n\nNed comments that Robert should visit [[the Wall]], but Robert responds that he has more important concerns such as replacing Lord Arryn, who held several important positions such as [[Warden of the East]]. Ned reminds Robert that that title traditionally goes with the domain of [[House Arryn]] but Robert declares that he will not appoint six-year-old Robert Arryn as [[Warden of the East]]. Ned reminds Robert that during times of peace the title is only an honor. The king is not pleased--the son is not the father, though maybe when the boy is grown the title will be given back. Robert mentions that he also needs a new [[Hand of the King]] and offers the position to Ned so they can work together again. Then Robert tells Ned how the responsibilities bore him and complains that he is surrounded by flatterers and fools. He insists that he wants Ned to come south to [[King\'s Landing]] to be Hand of the King, the second most important man in the kingdom.\n\nNed does not want the position and tries to declare himself unworthy of the honor. Robert only jokes that he is not trying to honor Ned but to get him to run the kingdom for him, relating the low-born saying that \xe2\x80\x9cthe King eats and the Hand takes the shit.\xe2\x80\x9d Robert asks for at least a smile, but Ned replies that it is said to be so cold in the North that a man\'s laughter freezes in his throat and chokes him to death.\n\nKing Robert also offers to marry his son, the Crown Prince Joffrey, to Ned\'s eleven-year-old daughter [[Sansa Stark]] to join the Houses of Stark and Baratheon as he and Lyanna were supposed to. Ned hesitates to make this decision, wishing to speak to his wife, but Robert asks him not to take too long.

He also realizes that his father has seen to it that Tyrion received little of the credit for saving the city. Bronn has been knighted, and now goes by Ser Bronn of the Blackwater. Lord [[Jacelyn Bywater]] was killed by his own men during the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], and Ser [[Addam Marbrand]] was named Commander of the [[City Watch of King\'s Landing|City Watch]]. [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] has returned [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] to the city, and the [[House Kettleblack|Kettleblacks]], now all [[knight]]s, are no longer working for Tyrion. His cousin [[Tyrek Lannister|Tyrek]] still has not been found, and is feared dead. Additionally, Tyrion\'s [[Vale mountain clans|mountain clansmen]] have been chased out of the city. Some remain in the [[kingswood]], but others return to the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]]. Tyrion asks Bronn to learn more about Ser [[Mandon Moore]], trying to discover if his sister sent the [[Kingsguard]] to kill him.\n\nTyrion forces himself to dress and visit his father, despite his near captivity in [[Maegor\'s Holdfast]] by his sister. Lord Tywin reveals that some battles are won by quills and ravens, and is in the process of composing letters. The [[Hand of the King|Hand]] tells his son that Ser [[Helman Tallhart]] and [[Robett Glover]] are marching on [[Duskendale]], but he has sent Lord [[Randyll Tarly]] and Ser [[Gregor Clegane|Gregor]] to deal with them. Tyrion seeks a little gratitude from his father, but Lord Tywin tells him, &quot;Mummers and monkeys require applause.&quot; Tyrion states that he wants [[Casterly Rock]], as he is heir by rights since [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] is a sworn brother of the Kingsguard. Tywin will never let Tyrion have the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]]\xe2\x80\x99s ancestral seat, however, and warns him that he will hang the next whore Tyrion takes to bed.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Bronn]]\n*[[Addam Marbrand]]\n*[[Jacelyn Bywater]]\n*[[Tywin Lannister]]\n*[[Mandon Moore]]\n*[[Cersei Lannister]]\n*[[Tommen Baratheon]]\n*[[Tyrek Lannister]]\n*[[Helman Tallhart]]\n*[[Robett Glover]]\n*[[Randyll Tarly]]\n*[[Gregor Clegane]]\n*[[Jaime Lannister]]\n*[[Timett]]\n*[[Chella]]\n}}\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Battle of the Blackwater]]\n*[[King\'s Landing]]\n*[[Kingsguard]]\n*[[House Kettleblack]]\n*[[Knight]]\n*[[Maegor\'s Holdfast]]\n*[[Hand of the King]]\n*[[Duskendale]]\n*[[Casterly Rock]]\n*[[House Lannister]]\n}}\n\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n* The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n*[http://slynt.blogspot.nl/2012/06/re-read-tyrion-i-wounds-of-betrayal.html Analyses and summary of the chapter] in the course of a 10th reread by Slynth.\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/09/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-3 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords part 3] Analyses and summary by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Storm of Swords: Chapter 04]]    \n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Tyrion Lannister]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n\n[[es:Tormenta de Espadas-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 4]]\n[[fr:A Storm of Swords, Chapitre 05, Tyrion]]\n[[zh:&amp;#20912;&amp;#38632;&amp;#30340;&amp;#39118;&amp;#26292;-&amp;#31456;&amp;#33410; 4]]</text>\n      <sha1>lmo4126ey38o3munkr31pdl1snq7mk0</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Feast for Crows-Chapter 40</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5980</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>196420</id>\n      <parentid>166972</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-12-10T22:30:30Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5490">{{Infobox Chapter AFfC\n| pov\t\t= [[Arianne Martell]]\n| title\t\t= The Princess in the Tower\n| place         = [[Sunspear]]\n| page\t\t= 587\n| previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 39|Cersei IX]]\n| current\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 40|The Princess in the Tower]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 41|Alayne II]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 21|The Queenmaker]] \n| arc next\t=\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Arianne Martell|Arianne]] is imprisoned atop the [[Sunspear#Spear Tower|Spear Tower]], contemplating her failed scheme. She never expected someone to inform her father of the plan, nor for [[Areo Hotah|Hotah]] to intercept them, and certainly not [[Gerold Dayne]]\'s unprovoked attack on [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]]. Dayne escaped from Hotah\'s men, but he left a terrible scar on Myrcella\'s face, barely missing a beheading stroke as was his apparent intent. Thinking her father would see her within a day, Arianne becomes distraught as days turn into weeks, and although servants come and go with food, none will speak to her. She considers who could have betrayed her, ponders her feelings at the loss of [[Arys Oakheart|Ser Arys]], and thinks of her close relationship with [[Tyene Sand|Tyene]]. She eventually persuades the young serving girl [[Cedra]] to deliver a letter to Lord [[Franklyn Fowler|Fowler]], knowing that the girl has feelings for [[Garin (Orphans)|Garin]] (who, Arianne assumes, is imprisoned at [[Ghaston Grey]] along with her other co-conspirators). But the next day, Cedra does not return, and Arianne never sees her again during her imprisonment.\n \nAfter an indeterminate period of agonized waiting, Areo Hotah arrives to bring her before her father. Prince [[Doran Martell|Doran]] asks her why, to which Arianne replies, &quot;For the honor of our [[House Martell|House]].&quot; The Prince tells her they have not caught Dayne, but the damage he did to Myrcella, a ward of their house, has done naught but bring the Martells dishonor. He cautions her that a war with the [[Iron Throne]] is the last thing they need. Although the [[Daeron I Targaryen|Young Dragon]] wrote that [[Dorne]] was populous, his memoirs were written to portray himself in a better light. Prince Doran admits that Dorne is actually the least populous of the [[Seven Kingdoms]], and could not survive open war with the Throne. He admits it was a mistake not to have had her taken prior to running off with Myrcella, but he will not reveal who betrayed her. When he tells her that she disappoints him, Arianne retorts, &quot;You have been disappointing me for years, Father.&quot; \n\nPrince Doran discloses that none of her co-conspirators are imprisoned. Instead, he has sent Ser [[Andrey Dalt]] to [[Norvos]] to serve Arianne\'s mother; Garin is in [[Tyrosh]] for two years; and [[Sylva Santagar|Sylva]] was sent to [[Greenstone]] to marry Lord [[Eldon Estermont]]. He goes on to remark that Arianne and her cousins may get the war they wanted, as Ser [[Balon Swann]] is on his way to [[Sunspear]]. The Prince has several of his bannermen stalling him, but eventually Ser Balon will discover that his brother in the [[Kingsguard]], Ser [[Arys Oakheart|Arys]], is dead and Myrcella maimed.&lt;ref&gt;Ser Balon\'s arrival happens in [[A Dance with Dragons]], [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 38|Chapter 38]]&lt;/ref&gt; Arianne continues to taunt her father, and he cautions her that he is out of patience. But the princess is unimpressed, remarking, &quot;For Lord [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] you always had the forbearance of [[Baelor I Targaryen|Baelor the Blessed]], but for your own blood, none.&quot; He responds, &quot;You mistake patience for forbearance. I have worked at the downfall of Tywin Lannister since the day they told me of [[Elia Martell|Elia]] and her children.&quot;\n\nWhen Arianne tells him that she wants her rights to Dorne, Prince Doran finally reveals that she will have the kingdom when he passes. Arianne divulges that she knew of his scheme to make [[Quentyn Martell|Quentyn]] his heir, but her father tells her that he had other plans for her. He offered her hand to old men because he knew she would rebuke them, but he had to be seen as trying. All along, he had promised her to Prince [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]], but now that the last male Targaryen is dead, he has no reason to deny her her right to Dorne. He finishes by saying, &quot;We princes make our careful plans and the gods smash them all awry.&quot; His original plan was to send her to Tyrosh to serve as the Archon\'s cupbearer, where she could meet her betrothed in secret, while her brother Quentyn was being raised to assume the seat of their House. Finally he reveals why her brother is overseas: to bring back their heart\'s desire. When Arianne asks what that is, her father replies, &quot;Vengeance. Justice. Fire and blood.&quot;\n\n==References and Notes== \n{{References}}\n*The  synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/09/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-feast-for-crows-part-29 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Feast for Crows, Part 29].

Some of the men are becoming ornery because there is so little food, and [[Craster]] seems to be hiding a larder. [[Jeor Mormont|Mormont]] speaks with [[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] about [[dragonglass]], noting in disgust that the Watch once knew the purpose of obsidian weapons. Their true enemies are the [[Others]], but they had forgotten.\n\nCraster soon makes it clear he wants the crows gone, and several members start to accuse him of not sharing all his food. The argument worsens, until finally Craster attacks [[Clubfoot Karl]], beginning the [[mutiny at Craster\'s Keep]]. [[Dirk]] slits Craster\'s throat, and when Mormont screams at them that there is no crime worse than murder at a host\'s dinner table, [[Ollo Lophand]] stabs the Lord Commander. Sam watches in horror as the deserters begin to rape Craster\'s wives, and sees the few men still loyal to the Watch flee because they are outnumbered. [[Grenn]], [[Bedwyck|Giant]], [[Edd Tollett|Dolorous Edd]], and a few others get away. Mormont, dying, commands Sam to return to the Wall with all haste and tell everyone what has happened. He also asks Sam to tell his son [[Jorah Mormont|Jorah]] that Mormont\'s dying wish is for Jorah to take the black. His last words to Sam are, &quot;Tell Jorah. Forgive him. My son. Please. Go.&quot; Sam is approached by [[Gilly]], who has recently given birth to a son, and two of Craster\'s other, older, wives. Gilly asks Sam to take her with him, to flee on horseback someplace warm.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Craster]]\n*[[Jeor Mormont]]\n*[[Samwell Tarly]]\n*[[Clubfoot Karl]]\n*[[Dirk]]\n*[[Ollo Lophand]]\n*[[Grenn]]\n*[[Bannen]]\n*[[Bedwyck]] Giant\n*[[Edd Tollett]] Dolorous Edd\n*[[Jorah Mormont]]\n*[[Gilly]]\n*Fletcher [[Dick]]\n}}\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Craster\'s Keep]]\n*[[Night\'s Watch]]\n*[[Dragonglass]]\n*[[Others]]\n}}\n\n\n==References and Notes==\n*The synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/02/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-19 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Part 19].

The price of their entry, which was negotiated between Jon and Tormund, is that the wildlings will yield all valuables so that they can be sold for food, as well as one hundred boys as hostages. Initially, two girls are included in the one hundred hostages, although Jon spots them and they are replaced by two new boys. Tormund voluntarily includes his own son as a hostage as a sign of good faith. Jon decides to take him on as his own squire. \n\nWhile watching the Wildlings pass through the wall, Jon and Tormund speak of many things. Jon mentions that [[Melisandre]] burned the [[horn of Joramun]] that Mance and the wildlings were supposedly going to use to break down the Wall. Tormund tells Jon that although they did find that huge horn in the [[Skirling Pass]], it is not actually the true Horn of Joramun, or they would have used it when they assaulted the Wall. Jon, confused, tries to decide whether it was Mance that lied to him or Tormund lying to him now about the authenticity of the horn. \n\nThe rear guard of the Wildings with Tormund includes a warg who is accompanied by his boar. [[Ghost]] and this boar seem to be on edge around each other, and it is mentioned that they should be restrained while the wildings are staying at Castle Black. Most of the wildlings will be relocated in the coming weeks. \n\nLater, Jon receives a letter from [[Cotter Pyke]], saying that he is stranded at [[Hardhome]], and calls for help. He also reveals that the Braavosi captains on loan from Tychos would only allow wildling women and children aboard their ships, and that the Woods Witch has taken to calling them slavers. This explains Arya\'s report that the wildlings from Hardhome had been captured by slavers, as narrated in &quot;The Blind Girl&quot;.

Her plight moves Theon considerably.\n\nTheon has been chosen to ceremoniously present &quot;Arya&quot; in marriage to Ramsay, since he was the longtime ward of [[Eddard Stark]] and it is widely believed that Arya\'s trueborn brothers are dead. [[Jon Snow]] is a bastard half-brother and while Theon believes [[Bran Stark|Bran]] and [[Rickon Stark]] to be alive, he does not dare to reveal that.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Winterfell]] is suffering from both a hard white frost and the looming menace of the coming of [[Stannis Baratheon]]\'s troops. Even so, Ramsay marries Fake Arya in the [[godswood]]. A bard by the name of Abel arrives uninvited, with six women followers, to perform for the wedding.&lt;ref&gt;Page 491; see also page 472, at the trailing end of [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 35|Chapter 35 (Jon)]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Theon believes that he hears his name (&quot;Theon&quot;) whispered by the godswood, after months of thinking of himself only as Reek. That and the memories of a different life in a far livelier Winterfell shake him deeply.\n\nAfter the marriage, there is a banquet with many northern guests, including Lord [[Wyman Manderly]], who is [[Frey Pies/Theories|particularly pleased with the meal]]. Lady [[Barbrey Dustin]] engages in a surprisingly frank conversation with Theon about her mistrust of the Boltons and of the [[maester]]s of the [[Citadel]].\n\nRamsay calls for Theon and cruelly humiliates both him and the fake Arya (Jeyne) in his quarters.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 37]]\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Theon Greyjoy|&quot;Reek&quot;]]\n*[[Jeyne Poole|&quot;Arya Stark&quot;]]\n*[[Harwood Stout]]\n*[[Ondrew Locke]]\n*[[Hother Umber]]\n*[[Walder Frey (son of Jammos)]]\n*[[Walder Frey (son of Merrett)]]\n*[[Roose Bolton]]\n*[[Ramsay Bolton]]\n*[[Walda Frey (daughter of Merrett)]]\n*[[Mance Rayder|Abel]]\n*[[Barbrey Dustin]]\n*[[Hosteen Frey]]\n*[[Aenys Frey]]\n*[[Medrick|Maester Medrick]]\n*[[Rhodry|Maester Rhodry]]\n*Maester [[Henly (Maester)|Henly]]\n*[[Sour Alyn]]\n*[[Yellow Dick]]\n*[[Damon Dance-for-Me]]\n*[[Skinner]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Arya Stark]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n*[[Sansa Stark]]\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Bran Stark]]\n*[[Rickon Stark]]\n*[[Catelyn Tully]]\n*[[Brandon Stark]]\n*[[Benjen Stark]]\n*[[Jon Snow]]\n*[[Wyman Manderly]]\n*[[Stannis Baratheon]]\n*[[Balon Greyjoy]]\n*[[Jory Cassel]]\n*[[Luwin|Maester Luwin]]\n*[[Sansa Stark]]\n*[[Tommen Baratheon]]\n*[[Rodrik Cassel]]\n*[[Smiler]]\n*[[Walder Frey]]\n*[[Danny Flint]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Wendel Manderly]]\n*[[Wylis Manderly]]\n*[[Wynafryd Manderly]]\n*[[Tywin Lannister]]\n*[[Jaime Lannister]]/[[Jaime Lannister|Kingslayer]]\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]]/[[Tyrion Lannister|Imp]]\n*[[Halys Hornwood]]\n*[[Medger Cerwyn]]\n*[[House Slate|Lord Slate]]\n*[[Rickard Stark]]\n*[[Walys Flowers|Maester Walys]]\n*[[Mors Umber|Crowfood Umber]]\n*[[Arnolf Karstark]]\n*[[Rat Cook]]\n*[[Kyra]]\n|}\n\n==Places and Terms Mentioned==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[Winterfell]]\n*[[Winterfell#Glass Garden|Glass Garden]]\n*[[Barrowton]]\n*[[Dreadfort]]\n*[[The North]]\n*[[Pyke]]\n*[[Winterfell|Great Hall]]\n*[[White Harbor]]\n*[[Flint\'s Finger]]\n*[[Moat Cailin]]\n*[[Arbor]]\n*[[Citadel]]\n*[[Oldtown]]\n*[[Deepwood Motte]]\n*[[Winterfell|Great Keep]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[House Stark]]\n*[[Night\'s Watch]]\n*[[Wall]]\n*[[House Slate]]\n*[[House Ryswell]]\n*[[House Hornwood]]\n*[[House Cerwyn]]\n*[[Godswood]]\n*[[Weirwood]]/[[Weirwood|Heart Tree]]\n*[[House Bolton]]\n*[[old gods]]\n*&quot;[[Two Hearts That Beat As One]]&quot;\n*[[Ironborn]]\n*[[Drowned God]]\n*[[House Frey]]\n*&quot;[[Fair Maids of Summer]]&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[House Umber]]\n*[[House Flint]]\n*[[House Manderly]]\n*[[House Tallhart]]\n*[[House Poole]]\n*&quot;[[The Night That Ended]]&quot;\n*[[Red Wedding]]\n*[[House Lannister]]\n*[[Maesters|Maester]]/[[Maesters#Archmaester|Archmaester]]\n*[[House Hightower]]\n*[[House Tully]]\n*[[R\'hllor|Red God]]\n*[[Kingsroad]]\n*[[House Karstark]]\n*[[Bastard\'s Boys]]\n|}\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Theon Greyjoy]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Winterfell]]\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 37]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 38, Le prince de Winterfell]]</text>\n      <sha1>6i4jmqo5z647fzg6xj8mkb8g3b4oqpe</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 37</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5776</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>165640</id>\n      <parentid>165223</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-09T18:19:03Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6743">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]\n| title\t\t= Jaime V\n| place         = [[Harrenhal]]\n| page\t\t= 416\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 36|Davos IV]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 37|Jaime V]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 38|Tyrion V]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 31|Jaime IV]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 44|Jaime VI]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==    \n[[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] and [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]] are in the bathhouse in [[Harrenhal]], washing themselves before meeting [[Roose Bolton]]. Jaime feels dizzy in the hot bath, and begins to tell Brienne his story despite his own misgivings about revealing the tale. Jaime says, &quot;[[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys]] would have bathed in wildfire if he\xe2\x80\x99d dared. The [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]] were all mad for fire.&quot; After the [[Battle of the Bells]], Aerys realized that [[Robert Baratheon]] was no mere outlaw, and that the Targaryens faced their greatest threat since the [[Blackfyre Rebellion|Blackfyre Pretenders]]. He began to disperse his [[Kingsguard]] to take command of the army, recalled [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]] from the south, and sent letters to [[Casterly Rock]]. But when [[Tywin Lannister]] never responded, Aerys commanded his pyromancers [[Rossart]], [[Garigus]] and [[Belis]] \xe2\x80\x9cto place caches of [[wildfire]] throughout [[King\'s Landing]].\xe2\x80\x9d Lord [[Qarlton Chelsted|Chelsted]], the current [[Hand of the King|Hand]], found out what was going on and tried to stop Aerys from continuing along his mad course, but Aerys had him killed and named the pyromancer Rossart, the man who had burned [[Rickard Stark]] alive, his Hand.\n\nAll this time, Jaime remained in the throne room guarding the king and his secrets. After the [[Battle of the Trident|Trident]], Aerys sent [[Rhaella Targaryen|his wife]] and Prince [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]] to [[Dragonstone]], but kept [[Elia Martell|Elia]] and her children in the [[Red Keep]] because he thought that Prince [[Lewyn Martell]] had betrayed Rhaegar during the battle, and thus needed Elia and the children as hostages to ensure [[Dorne]]\'s loyalty. With the wildfire in place, Aerys told Rossart, &quot;The traitors want my city, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll give them naught but ashes. Let Robert be king over charred bones and cooked meat.&quot; Aerys may have thought that the great fire would kill everyone, but transform him into a dragon, much as [[Aerion Targaryen|Aerion Brightflame]] had thought. When the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] appeared before King\'s Landing [[Varys]] advised to keep the gates closed. But on the advice of [[Pycelle]], Aerys let in the Lannisters, who proceeded to [[Sack of King\'s Landing|sack King\'s Landing]]. \n\nJaime felt he had to act after the Mad King commanded him to bring him his father\xe2\x80\x99s head. He killed Rossart, then returned to the Throne room and killed King Aerys. Days later he hunted down and killed the remaining two of Aerys\xe2\x80\x99 pyromancers, Garigus and Belis, so that their secret would die with them. When Brienne asks why no one else knows this tale, Jaime tells her that the [[Kingsguard]] are sworn to protect the king\xe2\x80\x99s secrets, and that [[Eddard Stark|Eddard]] would never have believed his tale. Jaime then nearly passes out from the heat, and Brienne calls out for [[Qyburn]]. \n\nThey are brought before Roose Bolton, who tells them he chose to wed [[Walda Frey (daughter of Merrett)|Walda Frey]] because Lord [[Walder Frey]] offered him his bride\xe2\x80\x99s weight in silver. When Brienne inquires after [[Arya Stark|Arya]], Bolton mysteriously states that she was lost for a time, but she has been found and is to be returned safely to the north. Bolton tells them he awarded Harrenhal to [[Vargo Hoat]] because the goat was a stranger to the [[Seven Kingdoms]] and did not know \xe2\x80\x98the prize was poisoned\xe2\x80\x99. He means the curse of Lord Tywin, for Hoat was not aware of what Tywin does to traitors such as the [[House Tarbeck|Tarbecks]] and the [[House Reyne|Reynes]]. Bolton explains that he has a small problem, because the goat wishes to return Jaime to [[Rickard Karstark]] to claim the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s reward of [[Alys Karstark|his daughter]]\xe2\x80\x99s hand in marriage. Vargo had Jaime\xe2\x80\x99s hand chopped off to send as a grisly token to Lord Tywin, feeling he would be well safe in [[Karhold]]. What he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know is that [[Robb Stark|Robb]] has beheaded Lord Karstark, and the goat is now doomed. But since Vargo is in Bolton\xe2\x80\x99s employ, Tywin might feel that Bolton was responsible for the maiming as well. Jaime agrees to carry word to his father absolving Bolton of all blame. But as for Brienne, Bolton tells her, &quot;It would be unconscionable of me to deprive Lord Vargo of both his prizes.&quot;\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Jaime Lannister]]\n*[[Brienne of Tarth]]\n*[[Roose Bolton]]\n*[[Aerys II Targaryen]] The Mad King\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n*[[Rhaegar Targaryen]]\n*[[Tywin Lannister]]\n*[[Rossart]]\n*[[Garigus]]\n*[[Belis]]\n*[[Qarlton Chelsted]]\n*[[Rickard Stark]]\n*[[Rhaella Targaryen]]\n*[[Viserys Targaryen]]\n*[[Elia Martell]]\n*[[Lewyn Martell]]\n*[[Aerion Targaryen]] Brightflame\n*[[Varys]]\n*[[Pycelle]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n*[[Qyburn]]\n*[[Walda Frey (daughter of Merrett)]]\n*[[Walder Frey]]\n*[[Arya Stark]]\n*[[Vargo Hoat]] The Goat\n*[[Rickard Karstark]]\n*[[Alys Karstark]]\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n}}\t\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Harrenhal]]\n*[[House Targaryen]]\n*[[Battle of the Bells]]\n*[[Blackfyre Rebellion]]\n*[[Kingsguard]] \n*[[Casterly Rock]]\n*[[Wildfire]]\n*[[King\'s Landing]]\n*[[Hand of the King|Hand]]\n*[[Battle of the Trident]]\n*[[Dragonstone]]\n*[[Red Keep]]\n*[[Dorne]]\n*[[House Lannister]]\n*[[Sack of King\'s Landing]]\n*[[Kingsguard]]\n*[[Seven Kingdoms]]\n*[[House Tarbeck]]\n*[[House Reyne]]\n*[[Karhold]]\n}}\n\n\n==References and Notes==    \n*The synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html]    \n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/03/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-21 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Part 21].

He recalls the horror that occurred at the Fist, when the wights fell on the [[Night\'s Watch]]. [[Jeor Mormont|Mormont]] had commanded him to send ravens with warning, and Sam kept sending them with updates, but when it came time to send a raven with word that their end was near, Sam had already let the birds escape. The Watch held the Fist at first, using fire arrows to hold back the wights. But the dead were relentless and eventually overpowered the Watch, men dying by the score. Mormont had the survivors mount up and form a wedge, slashing past the wights and down off the Fist into the forest. Now they are running for [[the Wall]], pursued by the wights and perhaps the [[Others]]. \n\n[[Grenn]] tries to get Sam to his feet, but the fat steward is too tired. Finally [[Paul|Small Paul]] arrives and carries Sam, but the three of them have fallen far behind the survivors with their torches, and the cold sets in.

The dagger causes the Other to melt away, body and armor, before Sam and Grenn\'s eyes.

[[Xaro Xhoan Daxos]] provides her an entire wing of his palace. After a bath, Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] arrives with a ship captain with news that King [[Robert Baratheon]] is dead and there is civil war in the [[Seven Kingdoms]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nThere is a large celebration for their arrival at [[Qarth]] apparent as [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys\xe2\x80\x99]] [[khalasar]] approaches the city and a column of camelry rides from the city to provide her an honor guard. The warlock [[Pyat Pree]] told Daenerys that Qarth is the greatest city, a crossroads, and ancient. Upon seeing the city, Daenerys has to admit the city is magnificent. It has three thick walls: the first is 30 feet high and made of red sandstone carved with animals, the second 40 feet high and made of granite carved with scenes of war, and the third 50 feet high, made of black marble carved with scenes of sex. [[Qarth#People of Qarth|Qartheen]] line the streets and balconies to watch them pass, black [[Drogon]] on her shoulder. The women are in gowns that bare one breast, and the men wear beaded silk shirts while the children wear only sandals and paint. Daenerys thinks how the [[Dothraki]] call these people \xe2\x80\x9cMilk Men&quot; for their skin and how [[Khal]] [[Drogo]] dreamed sacking the great city.\n\nThe merchant prince [[Xaro Xhoan Daxos]] rides up on his camel, which the Dothraki horses shy away from. He tells Daenerys that if she desires anything she sees it is hers. Pyat Pree sings from her other side \xe2\x80\x9cQarth itself is hers, she has no need of baubles,\xe2\x80\x9d and she should come to the [[House of the Undying]] to drink wisdom and truth. Daenerys tells them both that she only wants the [[Red Keep]] in [[King\'s Landing]] and if they want to give her gifts, to give her ships and swords. Pyat states that it will be as she commands and the other complements her on her wisdom. Xaro Xhoan Daxos warns her that warlocks are not to be trusted. The two continue to bicker until Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] mutters in the common tongue \xe2\x80\x9cThe crow calls the raven black,\xe2\x80\x9d that she should avoid both men, and that it would be best to not linger here. Daenerys, however, wants their help in winning her throne.\n\nDaenerys expected something grand when Xaro Xhoan Daxos offered the hospitality of his home, but not a palace larger than a market town, with an entire wing given over to her. He tells her that there will be a feast the next day with delicacies and music, and the [[Thirteen]] will come to do her honor. Xaro Xhoan Daxos and Pyat depart. The last of the three seekers, the shadowbinder [[Quaithe]] gives Daenerys a warning to beware of everyone, for they all lust for the power of her dragons, and then departs.\n\nAfter Quaithe leaves, Ser Jorah states she is right, but he also does not trust her. Daenerys admits that she does not understand Quaithe. While the others shower her in promises, she has only cryptic words. It also concerns her that she has not seen her face. Then Daenerys declares that they will keep their own watch, and will keep a sharp eye on the dragons. After [[Aggo]] confirms it will be done, she tells [[Rakharo]] to use good men and women to explore the rest of Qarth since they have only seen the parts that the seekers wanted them to see. She then asks Ser Jorah to go to the docks to get news of the [[Seven Kingdoms]], and maybe find a ship to carry them home. Ser Jorah tells her the usurper will kill her and wants to stay with her but she tells him that [[Jhogo]] can guard her, and he has the languages and more experience with the sea.\n\nAfter they leave, her handmaidens strip her of her travel stained silks and she bathes in a marble pool with golden fish. She wonders if the Red Keep has a pool like this with fragrant gardens, remembering [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]] saying that the Seven Kingdoms are the most beautiful place in the world. She also thinks she no longer has Drogo\xe2\x80\x99s khalasar behind her, only her four fierce [[Bloodrider|bloodriders]], and that the Dothraki plundered but do not know how to govern. She ponders Ser Jorah\xe2\x80\x99s words: &quot;The Usurper will kill you.&quot; She then thinks about [[Robert Baratheon]], strong as a bull, fearless in battle and loving war, who killed her brother [[Rhaegar Targaryen]], and his dogs: [[Eddard Stark]], [[Tywin Lannister]] and [[Jaime Lannister]]. How will she overthrow them? Even her dragons might not be enough. Viserys, who was a fool, believed the realm would rise for their rightful king. She then decides that the [[Red Comet|Bleeding Star]] has led her to Qarth for a purpose, and if the gods intend for her to conquer they will send a sign.\n\nNear eveningfall, [[Irri]] brings word that Ser Jorah has returned. He enters with [[Quhuru Mo]], captain of the [[Cinnamon Wind]] out of [[Tall Trees Town]]. Daenerys has her dragons all around her. He has the news that Robert Baratheon is dead, reported in [[Oldtown]], [[Dorne]] and [[Lys]]. There are tales that [[Cersei Lannister|the queen]], his brother ([[Stannis Baratheon]] or [[Renly Baratheon]], or [[Eddard Stark]] betrayed him. [[Joffrey Baratheon]] sits on the throne with [[House Lannister]] ruling, Robert\xe2\x80\x99s brothers have fled, and the [[Hand of the King]] has been seized for treason. Jorah does not think it likely that Eddard is a traitor, saying the long summer will come again before he besmirches his honor. Daenerys wonders if her brother would have been wiser had he known that vengeance was so close at hand. When asked, the captain replies he is not returning to [[Westeros]] for a year or more since his ship will sail east from Qarth, making the trader\xe2\x80\x99s circle around the [[Jade Sea]]. When Daenerys states he has brought her a precious gift, he tells her that he has been amply repaid by being allowed to see dragons. She aks him to come to her one day in [[King\'s Landing]].\n\nAfter the trader leaves, Ser Jorah warns Daenerys of speaking so freely. Daenerys replies that the [[Seven Kingdoms]] are flying to pieces like the khalasar did after Khal Drogo died. Ser Jorah tells her that she will still need gold, armies, and ships. Daenerys responds that she knows this, but she is the blood of the dragon. Jorah goes on to say that King Robert killed a dragon with a warhammer. To this she replies that dragons die, but so do dragon slayers.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n*Analyses and summary of the chapter [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2011/11/re-read-daenerys-ii.html in the course of a 10th reread] by Slynt. \n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/03/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-13 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 27]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Daenerys Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Qarth]]\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 27]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 28, Daenerys]]</text>\n      <sha1>rvol3kg1z5gh54093nc8rhzh51yicbf</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Game of Thrones-Chapter 1</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>3345</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>197716</id>\n      <parentid>139801</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2017-02-28T14:16:15Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6448">__NOTOC__\n{{Infobox Chapter AGoT\n| pov\t\t= [[Bran Stark]]\n| place         = North of [[Winterfell]]\n| title\t\t= Bran I\n| page\t\t= \n| previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Prologue|Prologue]]\n| current\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 1|Bran I]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 2|Catelyn I]]\n| arc previous\t= \n| arc next\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 8|Bran II]]\n}}\n\nLord [[Eddard Stark]] dispenses justice to a [[Night\'s Watch]] deserter. When they are on their way back to [[Winterfell]], and [[Jon Snow]] and [[Robb Stark]] find six orphaned [[direwolf]] pups.\n\n==Synopsis==\nIt is the ninth year of summer&lt;ref group=&quot;N&quot;&gt;Seasons in [[Westeros]] are of varying length, with summer and winter usually lasting several years. However, this has been an exceptionally long summer.&lt;/ref&gt; Seven-year-old [[Bran Stark]] is traveling with a party of twenty men, including his father Lord [[Eddard Stark]], to see the king\'s justice done. This is the first time that he is allowed to join. Bran\'s older brother [[Robb Stark|Robb]] thinks the man to be executed must be a [[wildling]] sworn to [[Mance Rayder]], the [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]], which makes Bran think of the tales Old [[Nan]] has told him about wildlings. \n\nThe [[Gared|offender]] turns out to be an old man dressed in the ragged blacks of the [[Night\'s Watch]] who has lost his ears and a finger to frostbite.&lt;ref group=&quot;N&quot;&gt;The [[Night\'s Watch]] [[ranger]] [[Gared]] from the [[A Game of Thrones-Prologue|Prologue]]&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Eddard questions the man briefly. Then two guardsmen drag the man to the stump of a tree and [[Theon Greyjoy]], Eddard\'s ward, brings Eddard his [[Valyrian steel]] sword, [[Ice]]. Eddard pronounces the sentence (desertion of the Night\'s Watch is punished by death) and raises the blade. [[Jon Snow]], Bran\'s [[bastardy|bastard]] brother, reminds Bran not look away and so Bran watches as his father strikes off the man\'s head with a single stroke. The head lands near Theon, who laughs and kicks it away. Jon calls Theon an ass under his breath and compliments Bran on his poise during the execution.\n\nOn the way back to [[Winterfell]], Robb and Jon argue about whether or not the deserter died bravely before racing their horses to the bridge, leaving Bran and his pony behind. Eddard rides up and asks if Bran knows why he executed the man himself. Bran replies that the man was a wildling. Eddard corrects that the man was a deserter, then explains that the [[First Men]] &amp;ndash; of whom the [[House Stark|Starks]] descendant &amp;ndash; believed that the man who passes the sentence should perform the execution himself, lest he become too comfortable with ordering deaths; the Starks still hold to that principle.\n\n[[File:Mark Evans direwolf pups.jpg|thumb|310px|left|[[Jon Snow]] and [[Robb Stark]] find the corpse of a direwolf.]]\n\nJon calls from up ahead for them to come see what he and Robb have found. They find Robb holding something in his arms next to the corpse of a wolf larger than Bran\'s pony. Jon correctly identifies the corpse as a [[direwolf]]. Theon comments that direwolves have not been seen south of [[the Wall]] for two hundred years. Bran then notices that Robb is cradling a small pup, and gives it a stroke after Robb reassures him. Then Jon gives him another pup. \n\nWhen they inspect the mother\'s corpse, they find a large piece of shattered antler lodged in her throat. The soldiers in the company feel this to be a bad omen. Theon offers to kill the pups but Bran protests. Eddard initially states killing them would be best but changes his mind when Jon points out that there are five pups, one for each of Eddard\'s legitimate children; since the direwolf is the sigil of House Stark, they must be meant to have the wolves. Bran immediately realizes, along with everyone else, that the comparison only works because Jon is not claiming a pup for himself.\n\nRobb and Bran both declare that they are willing to nurse their pups by hand themselves. Eddard stresses that the children must feed and raise the pups themselves, not pass them off to the servants, and must treat them well lest they become dangerous. Both Robb and Bran state they will not allow the pups to die. As they begin to ride away, Jon hears a noise and goes back to discover [[Ghost|a sixth pup]], an albino with red eyes, that had crawled away from its mother. Bran finds it curious that it is the only pup that has opened its eyes. Theon claims that the albino will die quicker than the others, but Jon disagrees, claiming it for himself.\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:60;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Bran Stark]]\n*[[Desmond]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n*[[Gared]]\n*[[Ghost]]\n*[[Grey Wind]]\n*[[Harwin]]\n*[[Hullen]]\n*[[Jon Snow]]\n*[[Jory Cassel]]\n*[[Lady (direwolf)|Lady]]\n*[[Nymeria (direwolf)|Nymeria]]\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Rodrik Cassel]]\n*[[Shaggydog]]\n*[[Summer (direwolf)|Summer]]\n*[[Theon Greyjoy]]\n}}\n| style=&quot;width:20;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Mance Rayder]]\n*Old [[Nan]]\n*[[Rickon Stark]]\n*[[Robert I Baratheon]]\n|}\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:20;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[Riverrun]]\n*[[Seven Kingdoms]]\n*[[Valyria]]\n*[[Wall]]\n*[[Winterfell]]\n| style=&quot;width:40;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Houses:\'\'\'\n*[[House Baratheon]]\n*[[House Cassel]]\n*[[House Greyjoy]]\n*[[House Stark]]\n*[[House Targaryen]]\n*[[House Tully]]\n| style=&quot;width:30;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n{{Columns|2|\n*[[Andal]]\n*[[Direwolf]]\n*[[First Men]]\n*[[Ice]]\n*[[King-Beyond-The-Wall]]\n*The [[Long Night]]\n*[[Night\'s Watch]]\n*[[Others]]\n*[[Rhoynar]]\n*[[Bastardy|Snow]]\n*[[Valyrian steel]]\n*[[Warden of The North]]\n*[[Wildling]]}}\n|}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notes}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2009/05/prologue-bran.html Humorous review of the chapter]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/03/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-1 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/002/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 01]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Bran Stark|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 01]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in the North]]\n\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 02, Bran]]\n[[pt:A Guerra dos Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 1]]\n[[zh:&amp;#26435;&amp;#21147;&amp;#30340;&amp;#28216;&amp;#25103;-&amp;#31456;&amp;#33410; 1]][[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\x91\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0\xd0\xbd I]]</text>\n      <sha1>ld5m7wvd5puh048i4fgzq0s91pohdpw</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 41</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5704</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>165736</id>\n      <parentid>98374</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-10T09:55:49Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Frernok</username>\n        <id>5007</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <comment>/*References and Notes*/</comment>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2608">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Jon Snow|Jon]]\n| title\t\t= Jon V\n| place         = [[Queenscrown]]\n| page\t\t= 461\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 40|Bran III]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 41|Jon V]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 42|Daenerys IV]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 30|Jon IV]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 48|Jon VI]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Jon Snow|Jon]] is with [[Styr|the Magnar]]\xe2\x80\x99s men nearing [[Queenscrown|a village]] alongside a lake.

The [[Thenn|Thenns]] captured an old man camped in one of the ruined houses, and Styr commands Jon to kill the man. Jon balks, but [[Ygritte]] slits the man\xe2\x80\x99s throat with her dagger. As Styr begins to command his men in the Old Tongue, a crash of thunder sounds, and suddenly a [[direwolf]] is attacking the Thenns. Jon mistakes the wolf for [[Ghost]] or [[Grey Wind]] for a moment, wondering if [[Robb Stark|Robb]] returned to the North, but he never realizes that it is [[Summer (direwolf)|Summer]]. The direwolf slaughters several [[wildlings]], and in the confusion, Jon mounts the old man\xe2\x80\x99s horse and begins to flee. He is hit with an arrow in the calf, believing the shot was fired by Ygritte. Jon gets away, forcing the horse to gallop for hours without rest, heading for Castle Black.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Jon Snow]]\n*[[Styr]]\n*[[Ygritte]]\n*[[Ghost]]\n*[[Grey Wind]]\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Alysanne Targaryen]]\n*[[Jaehaerys I Targaryen]]\n}}\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Queenscrown]]\n*[[Castle Black]]\n*[[Thenn]]\n*[[Direwolf]]\n*[[Wildlings]]\n}}\n\n\n==References and Notes==\n*The synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/03/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-23 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Part 23].

Quentyn promises to double the amount being paid to the Windblown by the [[Yunkai]] once they arrive in Dorne, but the Tattered Prince is unmoved. Quentyn reveals that he plans to steal one of the two remaining dragons in [[Meereen]], and the Prince names [[Pentos]] the price of his allegiance.\n\n{{Stub}}\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n* [[Quentyn Martell]]\n* [[Gerris Drinkwater]]\n* [[Beans]]\n* [[Books]]\n* [[Old Bill Bone]]\n* [[Tattered Prince]]\n* [[Rags]]\n* [[Pretty Meris]]\n* [[Barristan Selmy]]\n* [[Archibald Yronwood]]\n* [[Doran Martell]]\n* [[Anders Yronwood]]\n* [[Denzo D\'han]]\n* [[Orson Stone|Ser Orson]]\n* [[Dick Straw]]\n* [[Hugh Hungerford]]\n* [[Will (of the Woods)|Will of the Woods]]\n* [[Harghaz]]\n* [[Hizdahr zo Loraq]]\n* [[Cletus]]\n* [[Zahrina]]\n* [[Caggo]]\n* [[Robert Baratheon]]\n* [[Yurkhaz zo Yunzak]]\n* [[Yezzan zo Qaggaz]]\n* [[Morghaz zo Zherzyn]], the &quot;Drunken Conqueror&quot;\n* [[Lord Wobblecheeks]]\n* [[The Rabbit]]\n* [[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 60]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Quentyn Martell]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Meereen]]\n\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 60]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 61, Le pr\xc3\xa9tendant \xc3\xa9conduit]]</text>\n      <sha1>fwvn9qa5djq7di566k7j2u5w4dlwksd</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Game of Thrones-Chapter 19</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>3823</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>172441</id>\n      <parentid>165962</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-08-31T15:49:50Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Fyr</username>\n        <id>7293</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <minor/>\n      <comment>Allister -&gt; Alliser</comment>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8376">{{Infobox Chapter AGoT\n| pov\t\t= [[Jon Snow]]\n| place         = [[Castle Black]]\n| title\t\t= Jon III\n| page\t\t= \n| previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 18|Catelyn III]]\n| current\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 19|Jon III]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 20|Eddard IV]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 10|Jon II]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 26|Jon IV]]\n}} __NOTOC__\n\nAfter training, [[Jon Snow]] is attacked by several other recruits but saved by [[Donal Noye]], who shows Jon the error of his ways. Then Jon meets up with [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] and later learns from the Lord Commander that [[Bran Stark|Bran]] has awoken.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:Alliser Thorne.jpg|thumb|170px|left|Ser Alliser Thorne - \xc2\xa9 Amok]]\n\n[[Jon Snow|Jon]] is training with the other recruits under [[Castle Black]]\xe2\x80\x99s master-at-arms, Ser [[Alliser Thorne]]. Jon is by far the most skilled swordsman and during a sparring match he accidentally injures [[Grenn]]. Disgusted with the recruits, Thorne calls an end to training for the day. Jon knows that Thorne dislikes him, but that he dislikes the other boys more. Thorne mercilessly berates them all and has given Jon the moniker \xe2\x80\x9cLord Snow\xe2\x80\x9d in mockery of Jon\xe2\x80\x99s bastard status. To Jon\xe2\x80\x99s annoyance, everyone has taken up using the name.\n\nJon has found Castle Black cold and the people colder. He has no friends among the 20 recruits and finds that he despises them more as time goes by. Jon resents that nobody but [[Tyrion Lannister]] told him that [[the Wall]] would be like this. The fact that even [[Eddard Stark|his father]] never told him makes it hurt all the worse. Even Jon\xe2\x80\x99s uncle [[Benjen Stark|Benjen]] seems to have abandoned him, becoming a very different man who spends all his time among the high officers. Three days after arriving at the Wall, Jon had pleaded to be allowed to come on a ranging with his uncle. Benjen had told him that he was just a boy who had yet to earn the right to go. Benjen also explained that, while he loved [[House Stark|his family]], the men of the [[Night\'s Watch]] are his true brothers. The next morning, Benjen had had smiles, but not for Jon, telling him that they would speak when he returns.\n\nJon goes to his sleeping cell to be with [[Ghost]], thinking of how much he misses his family. His thoughts are interrupted by the arrival of Grenn, [[Todder|Toad]], and two other recruits. All of them are brutes and bullies sent to the Wall for crimes. After Grenn insults Jon\xe2\x80\x99s mother, a short fight breaks out that soon has Jon on the ground. However, before the boys can hurt Jon, [[Donal Noye]] the smith intervenes.\n\nAfter the others leave, Noye tells Jon that the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch has need of every man and that there is no honor in killing boys like Grenn. When Jon insists that they insulted his mother, Noye points out that them saying it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make it true. When Noye reminds Jon that he is in the Night\'s Watch for life, Jon reflects angrily on the fact that Donal Noye had a life before taking the black. He feasted and wenched and fought in battles, only taking the black after losing an arm during the siege of [[Pyke]].\n\n[[File:Matt Olson CastleBlack.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Castle Black - \xc2\xa9 Matt Olson]]\n\nJon claims that the others hate him because he is better than them, but Noye insists that they hate him because he \'\'thinks\'\' he is better. Noye then calls Jon a bastard and a bully. Being called a bully surprises Jon because his attackers were all older and bigger than him. Noye explains that Jon has humiliated and shamed the other recruits, who have had no formal training in swordsmanship whereas Jon was trained by an anointed knight. Jon starts to feel ashamed but is still angry. Noye tells him to accept his life on the Wall and reconsider how he treats his companions, or else to sleep with a dagger by his bed.\n\nAs he leaves, Jon looks up at the Wall, a massive blue-white cliff of ice that fills up half the sky and dwarfs Castle Black beneath it. The Wall is the largest structure built by men according to Benjen and the most useless according to Tyrion. Older than the [[Seven Kingdoms]], to Jon the Wall seems to represent the edge of the world. \n\nTyrion interrupts Jon\xe2\x80\x99s look up at the Wall by commenting that it makes you wonder about what lies beyond. Since arriving, Jon has seen little of Tyrion, who has been an honored guest among the high officers. When Tyrion asks Jon if he is curious about what lies [[beyond the Wall]], Jon replies that there is nothing special but inside wishes he could have ridden with his uncle Benjen on a ranging. When Tyrion calls him \xe2\x80\x9cLord Snow\xe2\x80\x9d by mistake, Jon objects but Tyrion asks him if he would prefer to be called \xe2\x80\x9cthe Imp&quot; and reminds Jon to make his weakness his strength by accepting it. \n\n[[File:Jeor Mormont by reneaigner.jpg|thumb|270px|left| Lord Commander Jeor Mormont - \xc2\xa9 Rene Aigner]]\n\nTyrion asks about Ghost, and Jon tells him that he chains the [[direwolf]] in the old stables during training but that the rest of the time he stays with Jon in his sleeping area in Harden\xe2\x80\x99s Tower. Tyrion says he thought those buildings were abandoned but Jon explains that, since most of the undermanned castle is abandoned, nobody cares where a person sleeps. He continues on to tell Tyrion that he sleeps alone because the others are afraid of Ghost. Tyrion declares the others wise, then mentions that Benjen Stark is late returning from his ranging. Jon recalls that his uncle was supposed to be back by his name day, which is now a fortnight past. Tyrion says that he has heard that a great number of rangers have disappeared recently.\n\nIn the Common Hall, Jon gets food and chooses a spot away from the other recruits and Tyrion sits opposite him. Ser Alliser interrupts Jon\xe2\x80\x99s conversation to tell him that the [[Lord Commander of the Night\'s Watch|Lord Commander]] wants to speak with him about a message concerning his half-brother. Tyrion suspects the worst and gives Jon his sympathy. Jon races to the Commander\xe2\x80\x99s Keep where Lord Commander [[Jeor Mormont]] gives him a message from [[Robb Stark|Robb]] at [[Winterfell]]. The message explains that [[Bran Stark|Bran]] has woken up, but is now a paraplegic. \n\nJon, overjoyed that Bran will live, rushes back to tell Tyrion. In his joy, Jon also apologizes to Grenn and offers to show him how to defend against the move that injured him. Ser Alliser sarcastically remarks that he would have an easier time teaching a wolf to juggle than training Grenn to fight. Jon replies that he will take the wager as he would love to see Ghost juggle. All the men in the hall, including Grenn, begin to laugh. As Ser Alliser clenches his fist in anger, Jon realizes that he has made himself a life-long enemy.\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n* [[Jon Snow]]\n* [[Alliser Thorne]], master-at-arms\n* [[Grenn]], a new recruit\n* [[Jeren]], a new recruit \n* [[Todder]], a new recruit\n* [[Dareon]], a new recruit\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n* [[Pypar]], a new recruit\n* [[Halder]], a new recruit\n* [[Donal Noye]] armorer \n* Lord Commander [[Jeor Mormont]]\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]]\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Bran Stark]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n*[[Benjen Stark]]\n*[[Sansa Stark]]\n*[[Arya Stark]]\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Rickon Stark]]\n*[[Ghost]]\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n*[[Stannis Baratheon]]\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Jon Arryn]]\n*[[Rodrik Cassel]]\n*[[Bowen Marsh]]\n*[[Cotter Pyke]]\n*[[Mance Rayder]]\n*[[Waymar Royce]]\n*[[Maester Aemon]]\n*[[Rhaegar Targaryen]]\n*[[Yoren]]\n|}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2009/05/catelyn-jon.html Humorous review of the chapter]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/05/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-10 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/020/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 19]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Jon Snow|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 19]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Castle Black]]\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 19]]\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 20, Jon]]\n[[pt:A Guerra dos Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 19]]\n[[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\x94\xd0\xb6\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbd III]]</text>\n      <sha1>8cmiielryw253orwlduh0af2wjm5g7b</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Feast for Crows-Chapter 19</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5655</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>142437</id>\n      <parentid>98532</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2014-09-22T20:11:00Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Scafloc</username>\n        <id>28</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3964">{{Infobox Chapter AFfC\n| pov\t\t= [[Aeron Greyjoy]] \n| title\t\t= The Drowned Man\n| place         = [[Nagga\'s Hill]]\n| page\t\t= 267\n| previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 18|The Iron Captain]]\n| current\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 19|The Drowned Man]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 20|Brienne IV]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 1|The Prophet]]\n| arc next\t= \n}}\n   \n==Synopsis==   \n[[Aeron Greyjoy|Aeron]] is wading in the ocean, berating himself for running from [[Euron Greyjoy|Euron]]. He considers [[Nagga\'s Hill|Nagga\'s bones]], where the [[Grey King]] ruled for 1000 years and warred against the [[Storm God]]. At dawn, Aeron has his drowned men sound the drums and warhorns to announce the onset of the kingsmoot. The prophet wishes for [[Victarion Greyjoy|Victarion]] to win the claim, and hopes Euron will make a mistake and declare early. But the first claimant is [[Gylbert Farwynd]], who rules a small barrier island far to the west of the [[Iron Islands]] where shapeshifters are said to live. Aeron sees madness in the lord\'s eyes. He offers to lead the ironmen to a bountiful land beyond the [[Sunset Sea]]; few of the gathered captains shout his name.\n\nNext up is [[Erik|Erik Ironmaker]], who once might have made a great king. But age and his immense weight make him an easy target for [[Asha Greyjoy|Asha]] to dismiss by asking him to stand up from his chair. The following claimant is another famous ironborn, Lord [[Dunstan Drumm]], who asks the gathering, &quot;Where is it written that our king must be a kraken?&quot; But the Drumm\'s downfall is the cheap loot he offers to swing the vote of the captains. \n\nVictarion steps forth next and asks for Aeron\'s blessing. His speech is short and concise and he offers to continue the rule his brother [[Balon Greyjoy|Balon]] set. His offerings are generous, and many captains give him their voice.\n\nBut it is Asha who interrupts the shouts of &quot;Victarion!&quot;, and declares that her claim is best as she is Balon\'s daughter. She tells the ironborn that war is bleeding their people and to continue it would be folly. She offers peace with the Northmen, and prosperous land on the western shores of the North. When she opens her chests to show the scant spoils of her warring in the [[North|Northlands]], the tumult of support she receives is staggering. \n\nFearing that a woman will win the kingsmoot, Aeron is shocked back to reality by the horrible bellowing of a horn. All eyes turn to a giant war-horn bound with ancient [[Valyrian Freehold|Valyrian]] glyphs being sounded by [[Cragorn|one of Euron\'s &quot;mongrels&quot;]]. After sounding the horn several times, the giant mute nearly falls over, his lips bloody and blistering. Euron steps forward and announces that he has sailed further and braved more than any other ironman. He offers not only peace and land, but all of [[Westeros]] itself to the ironborn. When Asha asks him how he means to do so, her uncle responds that he will use dragons to conquer the [[Seven Kingdoms]], as [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon]] did, using the [[Dragon Horn]] he found amongst the ashes of Old Valyria. When he tells the crowd that the horn can bind dragons to his will, and that he knows where three dragons can be found, he receives the overwhelming cheers of &quot;Euron! Euron! Crow\'s Eye! EURON KING!&quot;\n\n==References and Notes==\n*The synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/05/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-feast-for-crows-part-13 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Feast for Crows, Part 13].

The new Warden of the West spits when he discovers that it was [[Vargo Hoat]] who had Jaime\'s hand amputated, informing him that he offered [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] to forage for Hoat, but he refused, saying that some tasks are fit for lions, but foraging is best left for goats and dogs.\n\nDaven reveals how much the [[House Frey|Freys]] are vexing him, and even their own uncle [[Emmon Frey]] is trying his patience, complaining that he doesn\'t want his new seat destroyed by a siege. Worst of all is Ser [[Ryman Frey|Ryman]], who keeps tying a noose around [[Edmure Tully]]\'s neck each morning threatening the [[Brynden Tully|Blackfish]] that he means to hang him unless Riverrun surrenders; however, the Blackfish has long exposed Ryman\'s threat to be empty. \n\nThey speak of [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]] and his abandonment of [[Darry]], which reminds Jaime of the looks on [[Amerei Frey|Ami]]\'s family\'s faces when Lancel made his intentions clear. He is all too aware of how Lord [[Walder Frey|Walder]] [[Red Wedding|deals with]] [[Robb Stark|those who break Frey marriage proposals]]. Daven tells the Lord Commander that their uncle [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]]  passed through the camps heading west. He also mentions that Edmure\'s wife [[Roslin Frey|Roslin]] is pregnant, and oddly she is fond of the dispossessed Lord of Riverrun. He also tells Jaime of Lord [[Gawen Westerling]] constantly hounding him to rescue his wife and children, who are being held captive by Ser Brynden Tully. \n\nJaime is perturbed to learn how little help they are receiving from the bannermen of the Tullys who bent the knee to the [[Iron Throne]] after the [[Red Wedding]]. He realizes that he must secure Riverrun quickly to put down any threat of rebellion. Starving them out would take far too long.\n\nThe next morning, Jaime is considering a parley with Ser Brynden, and recalls when he was a squire of [[Sumner Crakehall]], sent to Riverrun with a message. Lord [[Hoster Tully|Hoster]] seated Jaime next to [[Lysa Tully|Lysa]], but the young man was far more interested in Lysa\'s famous uncle, the Blackfish. Within sight of the walls of Riverrun, Jaime has his tent pitched, and soon receives a visit from his Aunt [[Genna Lannister|Genna]] and her husband, Emmon Frey. \n\nGenna is still a Lannister through-and-through, with the wit and sharp tongue also shared by all of Lord [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]\'s children. Jaime lies to them that their son [[Cleos Frey|Cleos]] died bravely, and then listens to Emmon\'s complaints about a siege damaging his castle. Jaime enlightens Emmon to the fact that he was named Lord of Riverrun, but [[Petyr Baelish]] is the [[Lord Paramount of the Trident]]. Emmon is outraged to learn he is a vassal of Petyr, but Jaime is unconcerned, as there is nothing he can do about it and Cersei won\'t indulge someone like Emmon Frey. Genna tells Emmon to leave so she can speak in private with her nephew.\n\nLady Genna makes it known how she feels about Queen [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] rearming the Faith (namely that the decision is idiotic, given the trouble the [[Faith Militant]] caused the [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]] before they were finally put down and disbanded), Cersei\'s choice of councillors, in particular rejecting her brother Kevan as Hand, and Lancel\'s foolish decision to leave behind his lordship. When Jaime remarks that he plans to treat with Ser Brynden, his aunt tells him that he would be better off beheading Edmure. But Jaime feels this may further the Blackfish\'s resolve, and would sooner assault the walls of Riverrun if a parley will not work. \n\nAt last, they discuss Lord Tywin, and Jaime asks her if she loved her eldest brother. Lady Genna tells him how it was Tywin, a boy of only ten, who objected to their lord father\'s decision to wed the seven year old Genna to Emmon Frey, who was not even the heir to [[the Twins]]. For that alone, she loved him, stating, \'\'&quot;...every little girl needs a big brother to protect her. Who will protect us now?&quot;\'\' \n\nWhen Jaime insists that he is his father\'s son, his aunt replies, \'\'&quot;You smile like [[Gerion Lannister|Gerion]] and fight like [[Tygett Lannister|Tyg]], and there\'s some of Kevan in you, else you would not wear that cloak... but [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] is Tywin\'s son, not you.&quot;\'\'\n\n==References and Notes==\n* The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html]. \n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/07/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-feast-for-crows-part-24 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Feast for Crows, Part 24].

Twice they evade and once drive off [[longship]]s of the [[ironmen]], before they reach their destination and undergo customs inspections. The ironborn now control many of the outlying towns and fortifications surrounding the [[Arbor]] and along the [[Mander]] nearly to Oldtown, having sacked [[Ryamsport]] and taken [[Vinetown]] and [[Starfish Harbor]]. They have also been raiding ships in the area. [[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] learns that even Oldtown is at risk until Lord [[Paxter Redwyne]] can bring his fleet back from [[Dragonstone]]. Meanwhile, Lord [[Leyton Hightower]] has not left his tower in years, while his sons struggle to protect the great city. His youngest son, Ser [[Humfrey Hightower|Humfrey]], has sailed to the [[Free Cities]] to hire sellsails or persuade his half-sister [[Lynesse Hightower|Lynesse]] to loan him some of the Archon of Lys\' ships. As Sam prepares to disembark for the [[Citadel]], he considers whether it will be safe for [[Gilly]] at [[Horn Hill]], since it will only have a small regiment of guards left. Fortunately, Sam knows that Gilly will be safe aboard the \'\'Cinnamon Wind\'\', at least until he can learn more of the situation in Oldtown.\n\nUpon reaching the [[Citadel#Seneschal\'s Court|Seneschal\'s Court]], Sam is forced to wait a long while before he will be admitted to speak with the [[Seneschal]]. His patience running thin at the delay, Sam is approached by [[Alleras]], who informs him that it will take a penny to get past the acolyte. But when Alleras introduces himself, Sam is taken aback when he learns that the boy is called &quot;the Sphinx&quot;. Samwell then tells Alleras the story of how he reached Oldtown, leaving out only the secrets he has sworn to keep. After hearing all that has transpired, especially Maester [[Aemon Targaryen (son of Maekar I)|Aemon]]\'s plea that the Citadel learn of [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]], Alleras tells him to forget the Seneschal. The archmaesters will believe little of what Sam has to say, but there is one who will: Archmaester [[Marwyn]]. At the [[Isle of Ravens]], Sam recognizes [[Leo Tyrell]], but before many words can be exchanged, Marwyn the Mage appears and ushers Sam and Alleras into his chambers.\n\nMarwyn first describes how the [[Valyria|Valyrians]] used [[dragonglass]] for various magical means, noticing Sam\'s interest in the [[glass candle|Obsidian candle]]. Sam then repeats what he told Alleras, stating that Maester Aemon was convinced that Daenerys was the promised one in the prophecy, not Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]] or [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]. To this, Archmaester Marwyn reveals how fickle and treacherous prophecy can be, but he is still intrigued. He makes it clear to Sam that Maester Aemon may have been killed by the archmaesters had he spoken his mind to them. When Sam inquires why, Marwyn replies, &quot;Who do you think killed all the dragons the last time around? The world the Citadel is building has no place in it for sorcery or prophecy or glass candles, much less for dragons. Ask yourself why Aemon Targaryen was allowed to waste his life upon the [[Wall]], when by rights he should have been raised to archmaester. His blood was why. He could not be trusted. No more than I can.&quot;\n\nCommanding Alleras to look after Sam, Marwyn makes known his plan to travel to [[Slaver\'s Bay]], as Maester Aemon had intended. He intends to take the \'\'Cinnamon Wind\'\', hoping to reach Daenerys prior to the &quot;grey sheep&quot;, as he calls the other archmaesters. He advises Sam to work rapidly toward his chain, and to never mention anything of prophecies, dragons, or Daenerys to anyone in the Citadel. Marwyn quickly departs, and Alleras reveals to Sam that their meeting was not happenstance. The Mage knew Sam was coming, supposedly from the dragonglass candle. The [[Alchemist|novice]] in the room the whole time shows Sam to his quarters, finally divulging his name, &quot;I\'m [[Pate (Novice)|Pate]], like the pig boy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;It is implied that this Pate is in fact the [[Alchemist]], having taken Pate\'s identity  after the events of the [[A Feast for Crows-Prologue|Prologue]].

He remembers his attempt to escape with the bedwarmer [[Kyra]], but that had been a ruse by [[Ramsay Bolton]] for his own amusement.

[[Reznak mo Reznak]] keeps a strong voice in court, counseling the new King.\n\n[[Harghaz]] is now acclaimed as a hero after his fight against Drogon.{{Ref|aDwD|52}}\n\nSer Barristan notices the presence of [[Quentyn Martell]] and his two Dornish companions at court, remembering his former companionship to Prince [[Lewyn Martell]], his [[Kingsguard]] colleague and also Quentyn\'s uncle.  He considers the possibility that the [[poisoned locusts]] that [[Belwas|Strong Belwas]] ate might have been meant for Hizdhar, as part of a plot to direct Daenerys into marrying Quentyn, given that [[Oberyn Martell|another of the prince\'s uncles]] was notorious for poisoning those who got in his way.\n\nBefore he makes up his mind on the matter, three [[Wise Masters]] envoys from [[Yunkai]] arrive, along with their sellsword [[Bloodbeard]], to talk with Hizdahr.  They show Admiral [[Groleo]]\'s severed head as a gesture of intimidation, claiming his death as payback for the death of [[Yurkhaz zo Yunzak]], who was trampled to death during the panic when [[Drogon]] attacked the [[Fighting pits]].{{Ref|aDwD|52}}\n\nSer Barristan reminds King Hizdahr that Yurkhaz\'s death was accidental, while the Yunkai representatives free three of the six remaining hostages.  They demand that the dragons be destroyed as a condition for the release of the last three hostages. Barristan is also suspicious of Hizdahr\'s lack of reaction, given that all three of the [[Westeros|Westerosi]] kings he served under- [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys]], [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] and even the supposedly weak [[Jaehaerys II Targaryen|Jaehaerys]]- would have responded to such an insult by ordering every member of the Yunkish delegation killed; he also believe Bloodbeard is trying to start violence in order to get the plunder the peace has denied him.\n\nAs the court is ended for further deliberation of the King\'s council, Ser Barristan decides to counsel the [[Dornishmen]].  Despite appearing weak, the King has taken notice of Quentyn, and Ser Barristan considers it dangerous for them to remain in [[Meereen]].  He advises them to return immediately to [[Dorne]], going so far as offering the coin for the trip, and reveals that there was an attempt at poisoning either Daenerys or her consort during the fighting pits reopening.{{Ref|aDwD|52}}  Quentyn\'s shocked reaction reassures Ser Barristan that the Dornishmen had no part in the poisoning, but he still counsels Quentyn and his companions to leave Meereen and return to Dorne, for he considers his prospects of marriage unpromissing and his situation dangerous.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n* [[Barristan Selmy]]\n* [[Quentyn Martell]]\n* [[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n* [[Marghaz zo Loraq]]\n* [[Hizdahr zo Loraq]]\n* [[Reznak mo Reznak]]\n* [[Harghaz]]\n* [[Lewyn Martell]]\n* [[Belwas]]\n* [[Bloodbeard]]\n* [[Groleo]]\n* [[Aerys II Targaryen]]\n* [[Robert Baratheon]]\n* [[Jaehaerys II Targaryen]]\n*[[Yurkhaz zo Yunzak]]\n* [[Drogon]]\n}}\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Brazen Beasts]]\n*[[Wise Masters]]\n*[[Yunkai]]\n*[[Westeros]]\n*[[Meereen]]\n*[[Dorne]]\n*[[Dornishmen]]\n*[[Fighting pits]]\n*[[poisoned locusts]]\n}}\n\n\n==References==\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 59]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Barristan Selmy]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Meereen]]\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 59]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 60, Le chevalier \xc3\xa9cart\xc3\xa9]]</text>\n      <sha1>abl5r0u8po3htr0kgp2g1a4h05y7v7l</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Clash of Kings-Chapter 16</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5688</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166419</id>\n      <parentid>165433</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-23T20:47:14Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12618">{{Infobox Chapter ACfK\n| pov\t\t= [[Bran Stark]]\n| place         = [[Winterfell]]\n| title\t\t= Bran II\n| page\t\t= 179\n| previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 15|Tyrion III]]\n| current\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 16|Bran II]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 17|Tyrion IV]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 4|Bran I]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 21|Bran III]]\n}}\n\n[[Bran Stark|Bran]] receives the lords of [[the North]] at [[Winterfell]] for the [[harvest feast]]. Each has business to discuss, and many are interested in wedding Lady [[Donella Hornwood]], whose [[Halys Hornwood|husband]] and [[Daryn Hornwood|only son]] have died in the south. Lady Hornwood herself is concerned that [[Ramsay Snow]], the bastard of [[the Dreadfort]], means to seize her lands. The night [[Cley Cerwyn]] arrives with news that [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] has declared [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] a bastard, Bran dreams of a [[Jaime Lannister|golden man]] throwing him from a tower.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Bran Stark|Bran]] is awake long before dawn. [[Winterfell]] is full of guests for the [[harvest feast]], and he must play the prince. He always wanted to be a [[knighthood|knight]], not a prince, but now that he is broken he must spend his days listening to old men discuss things he barely understands. Lord [[Wyman Manderly]] arrived from [[White Harbor]] two day ago, and Bran welcomed him from [[Eddard Stark|his father]]\'s high seat. Afterward, Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]] said he had done well, but Manderly was only the first. Many lords with matters to discuss with their overlord will use the feast as a pretext.\n\n[[Hodor]] arrives to help him dress. Bran prefers to dress himself, but some things are just quicker with help. Bran is astonished by Hodor\'s deftness and strength and says he could have been a great knight if the gods had left him his wits. Mounting into his basket, Bran instructs Hodor to carry him downstairs. \n\nOut in the yard, Bran watches the Walders jousting against quintains. Bran notes that [[Little Walder]] struck harder, but [[Walder Frey (son of Jammos)|Big Walder]] sat his horse better. When Little Walder sees Bran on Hodor\'s back, he remarks that Hodor is an ugly horse, which angers Bran. The Walders continue to insult Hodor and Little Walder begins bumping him with his horse. Bran grows angrier and threatens to sic [[Summer (direwolf)|Summer]] on them, but Little Walder points out he is wearing armor and says he wants a wolfskin cloak. Then, [[Maester]] [[Luwin]] arrives to break up the argument and chastise the Walders. Big Walder has the grace to look ashamed, but Little Walder remains haughty. Luwin reminds them that good lords protect the weak and warns them to stay out of the [[godswood]]. He then calls on Bran to come with him to meet Lord Wyman.\n\n[[File:Wyman Manderly by cabepfir.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Lord Wyman Manderly - by Cecilia Latella\xc2\xa9]]\n\nThe maester tells Bran he was right to defend Hodor, but it should not have been necessary to fetch him to meet Lord Wyman. Bran apologizes and asks if they will talk of the [[War of the Five Kings|war]]. Luwin reminds Bran that he is only eight and should not speak unless spoken to. Inside, Bran is seated in his father\'s chair with Maester Luwin and Ser Rodrik beside him. The morbidly obese Lord Wyman Manderly is very pleasant, insisting no prince is ever late. He talks about White Harbor being the best place to mint currency and build a fleet for Robb\'s new kingdom. Talk of warships piques Bran\'s interest and he thinks it a splendid idea, but no one asks him. The meeting continues through lunch, during which Lord Wyman inquires about his widowed cousin Lady [[Donella Hornwood]], whose [[Halys Hornwood|husband]] and [[Daryn Hornwood|only son]] died on the [[Battle of the Green Fork|Green Fork]] and in the [[Battle of the Whispering Wood|Whispering Wood]]. He suggests that he would be interested in marrying her, or she could wed his son Ser [[Wendel Manderly|Wendel]]. Later, Lord Wyman informs them that [[Tywin Lannister]] has offered to ransom his son Ser [[Wylis Manderly|Wylis]] (who was taken captive on the Green Fork) if he withdraws his support for King [[Robb Stark|Robb]]. He has of course refused, but hopes for an equitable prisoner exchange as soon as possible.\n\n[[File:Donella Manderly.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Lady Donella Hornwood - by sir-heartsalot\xc2\xa9]]\n\nLady Hornwood arrives during supper, and Bran expresses his condolences to the grief-stricken widow. She thanks them, but asks leave to rest and continue the next day. The next morning\'s talk is devoted to preparations for the coming winter until Lady Hornwood warns them that [[Roose Bolton]]\'s bastard son [[Ramsay Snow]] is massing men at [[the Dreadfort]] and refuses to explain his purpose. When Ser Rodrik says he does not know the man, Lady Hornwood explains that Ramsay lived with his mother until [[Domeric Bolton]] died and left Roose without an heir. She adds that Ramsay brought along an equally-cruel servant named [[Reek]] who is said to never bathe. The two hunt together, and not for deer, and there are other tales that are hard to believe even of a Bolton. \n\nLady Hornwood fears Ramsay covets her lands now that her husband and son are gone. Bran wants to give her a hundred men, but Ser Rodrik only promises to protect her lands and adds that in time it may be prudent for her to wed again. She remarks that she is beyond childbearing age yet attracts more suitors than ever. She promises to marry if commanded, but there is no one to her liking. She points out that Lord Manderly is too big to share a bed with or lie underneath; Bran knows that men sleep on top of their wives, and imagines sleeping under Lord Wyman would be like sleeping under a horse. Ser Rodrik sympathizes and promises to look for a suitor more to Lady Hornwood\'s taste, at which point she hints interest in Ser Rodrik himself.\n\nAfter she leaves, Maester Luwin points out Lady Hornwood\'s hint, which makes Ser Rodrik uncomfortable. Bran notes that she is sad; Ser Rodrik adds that she is also gentle and not unattractive, but still a threat to the realm. Bran is incredulous, but the maester explains that without a direct heir there will be many claims to her lands, which Robb must adjudicate as the liege lord. When Bran suggests Ser Rodrik, the old castellan replies that he is only a knight and too old; when he dies the problem would resurface. Thinking of his own half-brother, Bran next suggests Lord Hornwood\'s twelve-year-old bastard [[Larence Snow]]. Ser Rodrik doubts that will please Lady Hornwood, but Maester Luwin insists they consider it.\n\nBran asks to be excused and Ser Rodrik agrees, saying he did well. There are still a few hours of daylight, so Bran goes to the godswood to visit Summer. He has Hodor take him to his favorite place by the pool near the [[heart tree]]. Suddenly, a naked [[Osha]] explodes out of the cold pool, startling everyone. When Bran asks about the cold, Osha says she likes it. She notices Bran staring at her and asks if he has never seen a naked woman. Bran has bathed with his sisters and seen serving women bathing, but Osha is hard and covered in scars, which she tells him were earned fighting men, mostly [[Night\'s Watch]]; she even killed one. Then she mentions overhearing that the Walders mocked Hodor. Bran recalls that Hodor never fights and says that [[Septon]] [[Chayle]] says Hodor has a gentle spirit. Osha replies that Little Walder is well named: big outside, little inside, and mean to the bones. Then she asks if Bran has had any more wolf dreams. When he say no, Osha declares a prince should lie better and begs his leave before hurrying back to the kitchens.\n\n[[File:MorsCrowfoodUmber.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Mors &quot;Crowfood&quot; Umber - by Robert O\'Leary\xc2\xa9]]\n\nThat night, Bran dreams of a [[weirwood]] calling to him and a [[three-eyed crow]] pecking at his face. He wakes to clamor of the arrival of the [[House Umber|Umber]]s from beyond the [[Last River]]. The next day, he greets their leaders, two of [[Greatjon Umber]]\'s uncles: [[Mors Umber]] (known as &quot;Crowfood&quot; because he lost an eye to a crow that thought him dead), and [[Hother Umber]] (known as &quot;Whoresbane&quot; for reasons no one will tell Bran). Mors immediately asks to wed Lady Hornwood; Luwin and Rodrik explain she is grieving but promise to consider it. Hother asks for longships to stop [[wildling]] raids across the [[Bay of Seals]]; Ser Rodrik recommends Hothor cooperate with Lord Manderly to provide lumber and receive shipwrights and sailors.\n\nDuring the audience, the steward of [[Deepwood Motte]] arrives with apologies from Lady [[Sybelle Glover]], who is tending to her young children. Bran quickly realizes the steward is the true ruler while Lord [[Galbart Glover]] and his brother [[Robett Glover]] are away fighting. After discussing the harvest, Ser Rodrik questions the steward about Larence Snow, and afterward Maester Luwin praises Bran\'s notion of making the bastard heir to Hornwood and says he will make a good lord for Winterfell one day. Bran protests that Robb\'s sons with his [[House Frey|Frey]] girl will be lords instead of him, but Ser Rodrik points out that nothing is certain; he has only his daughter [[Beth Cassel|Beth]] despite three marriages, and his brother [[Martyn Cassel]]\'s line died with his son [[Jory Cassel|Jory]] despite having four sons.\n\nThe next day, [[Leobald Tallhart]] from [[Torrhen\'s Square]], who arrived the day before, has his audience. He brings word that his nephew [[Benfred Tallhart]] is raising his own company of young lancers who all think themselves another young wolf; Leobald dismissed them as young rabbits once, so now they call themselves the [[Wild Hares]]. Bran remembers Benfred visiting Winterfell and being friendly with Robb and [[Theon Greyjoy]]. Clearly displeased, Ser Rodrik orders that Benfred is to remain at Torrhen\'s Square as commanded. Then Leobald mentions that his own wife [[Berena Hornwood|Berena]] was sister to Lord Halys Hornwood and suggests sending his younger son [[Beren Tallhart|Beren]] to foster with Lady Hornwood, saying he may even take up the Hornwood name if made heir. Bran has learned the proper answer and promises to bring up the matter with Robb and Lady Hornwood. After the audience, Maester Luwin states that he likes the idea, but Ser Rodrik thinks it will be hard for a boy to hold the lands. Luwin admits that with [[the Riverlands]] now part of the kingdom, it may be best to wed her to one of the lords of the [[Trident]].\n\nIn the days that follow, ravens arrive with regrets from the other Houses. The bastard Ramsay Snow will not be joining them, the [[House Mormont|Mormont]]s and [[House Karstark|Karstark]]s have all gone south, Lord [[Ondrew Locke]] is too old, Lady [[Lyessa Flint]] is too pregnant, and there is sickness at [[Widow\'s Watch]]. That leaves just Lord [[Howland Reed]], who has not left his swamps in sixteen years, and the [[House Cerwyn]], whose Lord [[Medger Cerwyn]] is a captive of the Lannisters.\n  \nThen, one blustery day, fourteen-year-old [[Cley Cerwyn]] arrives with a dozen lancers while Bran is riding [[Dancer (horse)|Dancer]] in the yard. Cley has always been a friend to Bran and his brothers and he immediately asks if [[Stannis Baratheon]] wrote Winterfell about [[Joffrey Baratheon]] being illborn. Bran suddenly feels like a giant hand is crushing his chest. When Cley asks if he is alright, Bran declares that Robb will beat Stannis, too. That night he does not have the dreamless sleep he prayed for. The three-eyed crow pecks out his eyes, telling him to fly. Then the crow pecks his brow until it pecks through his skull and then, suddenly, Bran can see again. He is climbing to a tower, slipping. He calls for help and a [[Jaime Lannister|golden man]] appears above him, saying, &quot;The things I do for love,&quot; and then tossing him out into empty air.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n*Analyses and summary of the chapter [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2011/07/re-read-bran-ii.html in the course of a 10th reread] by Slynt.\xc2\xa0\n*[http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2010/08/bran-tyrion.html Humorous review and summary of the chapter] by Jason.\xc2\xa0\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/02/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-8 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 16]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Bran Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Winterfell]]\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 16]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 17, Bran]]</text>\n      <sha1>58u8bvt0vv2jzqr9o76u9np0jmg6i65</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Game of Thrones-Chapter 64</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6025</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166006</id>\n      <parentid>117148</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-17T14:58:08Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7538">{{Infobox Chapter AGoT\n| pov\t\t= [[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n| place         = [[Dothraki Sea]]\n| title\t\t= Daenerys VIII\n| page\t\t= 587\n| previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 63|Catelyn X]]\n| current\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 64|Daenerys VIII]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 65|Arya V]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 61|Daenerys VIII]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 68|Daenerys VIII]]\n}} __NOTOC__\n    \n[[Khal]] [[Drogo]] falls off his horse. [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] orders the \'\'[[khalasar]]\'\' to halt and calls for [[Mirri Maz Duur]]. The godswife declares that only blood magic can save Drogo. As the rite is being performed, Drogo\xe2\x80\x99s [[bloodrider]]s attempt to intervene. A fight ensues in which Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] is injured and all of Drogo\xe2\x80\x99s bloodriders are killed. Daenarys starts to hemorrhage and Ser Jorah carries her into Drogo\'s tent.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Khal]] [[Drogo]] is looking drawn and swaying in his saddle. He makes no reaction as the large [[bloodflies]] circle and bite him. This concerns [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] who is used to seeing her husband catch the hated insects with his hands, quick as a snake, when they come too near. Drogo tore off the poultice [[Mirri Maz Duur]] had prepared for him six days ago, complaining that it itched. Instead, he used the soothing mud plaster of the herb women. He has also been drinking poppy wine, fermented mare\xe2\x80\x99s milk, and pepper beer heavily but not eating much. At night, he thrashes violently and even the kicking of their unborn child not longer seems to interest him.\n\nAs Daenerys reaches for him, Drogo reels from the saddle and falls heavily to the ground. Daenerys rushes to him. Only half conscious and struggling in her arms, Drogo insists that he must ride, for the \'\'khal\'\' who cannot ride is no \'\'khal\'\'. Now Drogo has fallen from his horse and it has been seen. When Drogo\xe2\x80\x99s [[bloodrider]]s come up, Daenerys commands that they will halt for the day and that the slaves be called to erect Drogo\xe2\x80\x99s tent. The bloodriders are not happy with either command; the region is not a camping ground and a woman cannot command. Daenerys insists that Drogo will punish them if they do not obey her and commands [[Qotho]] to find Mirri Maz Duur.\n\nOnce the tent is erected, Daenerys and her handmaidens bring the feverish Drogo inside and bathe him. Finally, Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] arrives with word that Drogo\xe2\x80\x99s fall is known all over the camp. He asks Daenerys to send her maids away and breaks the plaster from Drogo\xe2\x80\x99s wound. The wound has festered and is rank with corruption. Ser Jorah declares that Drogo is beyond saving and that they must flee before he dies. \n\nDaenerys asks why she should run, since her son will be \'\'khal\'\' after Drogo. Ser Jorah explains that the [[Dothraki]] follow only the strong; the \'\'[[khalasar]]\'\' will not follow a baby. Instead, the \'\'[[ko]]\'\'s will fight for the leadership and her baby will be killed as a challenge to their authority. Daenerys insists that her \'\'[[khas]]\'\' and Drogo\xe2\x80\x99s bloodriders will keep her child safe, but Jorah reminds her that the bloodriders\' last duty is only to return her to the \'\'[[dosh khaleen]]\'\' in [[Vaes Dothrak]] and then follow their \'\'khal\'\'. Daenerys does not want to return to join the \'\'dosh khaleen\'\', but she also refuses to leave Drogo.\n\nMirri Maz Duur arrives with Qotho, looking exhausted. Both Qotho and [[Haggo]], taking one look at Drogo, blame the godwife and start beating her. When Daenerys demands that they stop, Qotho threatens to take Daenerys out to be raped along with the \'\'[[maegi]]\'\'. Ser Jorah intervenes and eventually the bloodriders leave. \n\nAfter they leave, Ser Jorah explains that the bloodriders die with their \'\'khal\'\' and are now beyond fear because they see their death approaching. Daenerys tells Ser Jorah to don his armor. Once the knight has left, Daenerys tells Mirri Maz Duur to heal Drogo. The godswife states that he is beyond help and will be gone by morning. Daenerys pleads with her, insisting that there must be a way, a magical way. Mirri Maz Duur admits she does know some dark magic learned at great cost from a bloodmage from the [[Shadow Lands]]; it will cost a life. Daenerys asks if it means her life, but Mirri Maz Duur assures her it does not.\n\n[[File:Blood magic ritual by Kerry Barnett.jpg|thumb|280px|left|Blood Magic in Drogo\xe2\x80\x99s Tent - Kerry Barnett. \xc2\xa9 Fantasy Flight Games]]\n\nThey lower Drogo into a bath and bring his stallion into the tent. [[Jhogo]] pleads with Daenerys not to use forbidden bloodmagic and to allow him to kill the \'\'maegi\'\'. It takes [[Rakharo]], [[Quaro]], and [[Aggo]] to force the frightened stallion to the tub while Mirri Maz Duur chants. The godswife uses a red bronze knife covered in glyphs to cut the horse\xe2\x80\x99s throat and fill the tub with blood. The godswife then orders Daenerys, who is now filled with fear, to leave the tent; no one must look upon the old and dark powers the godswife\xe2\x80\x99s spell will wake. Outside, the gathered crowd stares at her. When Ser Jorah, now in his armor, sees the bloody footprints Daenerys leaves he asks what foolish thing she has done.\n\nDaenerys can hear the \'\'maegi\xe2\x80\x99s\'\' voice and see the shadows moving inside the tent. The Dothraki start to mutter and draw back. Drogo\xe2\x80\x99s bloodriders return with the healing eunuchs. When Qotho sees what is happening he moves toward the tent, intending to kill Mirri Maz Duur and then Daenerys. He pushes Daenerys aside as she tries to interfere and she screams for her \'\'khas\'\' to stop him. Quaro is quickly cut down, but Ser Jorah steps forward to confront Qotho. Without his helmet, the knight is hard pressed by Qotho\xe2\x80\x99s rapid strikes. Then Qotho\xe2\x80\x99s \'\'[[arakh]]\'\' cuts into Ser Jorah\xe2\x80\x99s hip and catches on the bone, giving Ser Jorah the opportunity to kill him.\n\nMeanwhile, the other bloodriders and members of Daenerys\xe2\x80\x99 \'\'khas\'\' have also come to battle. Jhogo\xe2\x80\x99s whip catches [[Haggo]] around the neck, giving Rakharo the chance to kill him. Daenerys is hemorrhaging from the birth of her child and crawling toward the tent, screaming that the price is too high. The bloodrider [[Cohollo]] catches her and is about to kill her when [[Aggo]]\xe2\x80\x99s arrow takes him in the chest.\n\nWhen Daenerys raises her head again, the crowd is dispersing. Some are saddling horses and riding off as the sun sets. She cannot rise and the shadows are whirling inside the tent. Ser Jorah comes to assist her and calls for her handmaids to get the birthing women. [[Doreah]] informs him that they believe Daenerys is cursed and are gone. Then she hears someone (possibly Aggo) telling them to take her to the \'\'maegi\'\'. Daenerys knows she does not want to go into the tent, but cannot speak. [[Irri]] and Doreah both agree that they heard Mirri Maz Duur say she knows about birthing. \n\nSer Jorah carries Daenerys into the tent.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/11/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-31 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/065/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 64]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Daenerys Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in the Dothraki Sea]]\n\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 64]]\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 65, Daenerys]]\n[[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\x94\xd1\x8d\xd0\xb9\xd0\xbd\xd0\xb5\xd1\x80\xd0\xb8\xd1\x81 VIII]]</text>\n      <sha1>dcr7q8aewt369jkxrpp8w4m7iddam3m</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 68</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>7030</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166647</id>\n      <parentid>144495</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-26T19:37:27Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1980">{{Infobox Chapter ADwD\n| pov\t\t= [[Quentyn Martell]]\n| place         = [[Meereen]]\n| title\t\t= The Dragontamer\n| page\t\t= 887\n| previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 67|The Kingbreaker]]\n| current\t= The Dragontamer\n| next\t\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 69|Jon XIII]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 60|The Spurned Suitor]]\n| arc next\t= \n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:The_dragontamer.png\xe2\x80\x8e|The Dragontamer by [http://ashleyhunterrice.tumblr.com/ Ashley Hunter Rice] |thumb|250px|left]][[Quentyn Martell|Quentyn]] goes ahead with his plan to steal the dragons. With the help of the [[Windblown|Windblown Company]], they make it to the pit where [[Rhaegal]] and [[Viserion]] are kept. There, however, they use the codeword &quot;dog&quot; on the [[Brazen Beasts]], who are actually part of the scheme to overthrow the king that very night. A fight ensues, and the four guards are slain, although Quentyn is almost slain by a spear. They enter and find that Rhaegal has also broken his chains since he was last in the pit, and that Viserion has created a cave for himself in the ceiling of the pit. Viserion is first attracted to [[Pretty Meris]], as he is looking for Daenerys, but then tries to exit the pit. Throughout this encounter, Quentyn tries to dominate the dragons like he had seen [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] do with [[Drogon]], but when he strikes Viserion with a whip, Rhaegal spews fire on him, setting him aflame.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n* [[Quentyn Martell]]\n* [[Rhaegal]]\n* [[Viserion]]\n* [[Pretty Meris]]\n*[[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n*[[Drogon]]\n}}\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Windblown]]\n*[[Brazen Beasts]]\n}}\n\n{{Stub}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 68]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Quentyn Martell]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Meereen]]\n\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 68]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 69, Le dompteur de dragons]]</text>\n      <sha1>fmqn4mynzt93e9y9yhkx0uswyujo0xo</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 11</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6817</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>197151</id>\n      <parentid>184477</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2017-01-28T22:00:42Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6002">{{Infobox Chapter ADwD\n| pov\t\t= [[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n| place         = [[Meereen]]\n| title\t\t= Daenerys II\n| page\t\t= 148\n| previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 10|Jon III]]\n| current\t= Daenerys II\n| next\t\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 12|Reek I]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 2|Daenerys II]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 16|Daenerys III]]\n}}\n\n[[File:Sarah Biddle Guided by Quaithe..JPG|350px|thumb|right|\'\'&quot;Hear me, Daenerys Targaryen....&quot;\'\' \xc2\xa9 Fantasy Flight Games]]\n==Synopsis==\nThere have been more murders by the [[Harpy\'s Sons]] on the streets of [[Meereen]]. This time they involved an attack on fully-armed [[Unsullied]] in pairs. Nine died, including one of [[Missandei]]\'s brothers, [[Mossador]]. Once again, [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] orders an investigation, permitting [[Skahaz mo Kandaq]] to torture a wineseller when she discovers that three [[freedmen]] were among the slain. Furious, Dany orders the Unsullied to restrict themselves to patrolling the walls, and imposes a blood tax on the great families of Meereen to fund a new mixed force of freedmen and [[shavepates]] to patrol the city streets under the control of Skahaz. The families of [[House of Zhak|Zhak]] and [[House of Merreq|Merreq]] are preparing to leave the city; the Queen orders that their wealth must remain behind, as well as some of their children in her custody.\n\nThat night, Dany offers Missandei the chance to return to [[Naath]], but the girl feels safer with her. Dreaming of [[Daario Naharis]], Dany hopes that the sellsword will remain loyal to her. Dany goes to take a bath on her terrace, when she is surprised by the voice of [[Quaithe]], speaking to her via some magic. &quot;Hear me, Daenerys Targaryen. The [[glass candle]]s are burning. Soon comes the [[bloody flux|pale mare]], and after her the others. [[House Greyjoy|Kraken]] and dark flame, [[Tyrion Lannister|lion]] and griffin, the [[Quentyn Martell|sun\'s son]] and the mummer\'s dragon. Trust none of them. Remember the [[House of the Undying|Undying]]. Beware the [[perfumed seneschal]].&quot; After telling her to remember who she is, Quaithe is gone. As the sun rises, Dany breaks her fast and prepares for court.\n\nAt court she gazes suspiciously at [[Reznak mo Reznak]] - could he be a traitor? [[Hizdahr zo Loraq]] pleads for the seventh time for the reopening of the fighting pits, this time cunningly presenting former fighters who themselves willingly ask to be returned to combat. She promises to consider all they have said and then ends the session.\n\n[[Barristan Selmy]] relates how he escaped from [[King\'s Landing]] and [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]]\'s guards, and defends [[Eddard Stark]] when Daenerys angrily denounces him as a traitor, asserting that Stark argued against having her killed in the [[small council]]. Dany asks to see her dragons: [[Rhaegal]] and [[Viserion]] have been chained up in a pit since the killing of the little girl [[Hazzea]], but [[Drogon]] could not be taken and was last seen flying off north to the [[Dothraki Sea]].\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Daenerys Targeryen]]\n*[[Irri]]\n*[[Jhiqui]]\n*[[Skahaz mo Kandaq]]\n*[[Reznak mo Reznak]]\n*[[Grey Worm]]\n*[[Missandei]]\n*[[Quaithe]]\n*[[Hizdahr zo Loraq]]\n*[[Khrazz]]\n*[[Barsena Blackhair]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Camarron of the Count]]\n*[[Goghor the Giant]]\n*[[Spotted Cat]]\n*[[Fearless Ithoke]]\n*[[Belaquo Bonebreaker]]\n*[[Barristan Selmy]]\n*[[Rhaegal]]\n*[[Viserion]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Daario Naharis]]\n*[[Black Fist]]\n*[[Cetherys]]\n*[[Mossador]]\n*[[Duran]]\n*[[Eladon Goldenhair]]\n*[[Loyal Spear]]\n*[[Marselen]]\n*[[Rylona Rhee]]\n*[[Willem Darry]]\n*[[Viserys Targaryen]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Aerys II Targaryen]]\n*[[Drogon]]\n*[[Green Grace]]\n*[[Belwas]]\n*[[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n*[[Sandor Clegane]]\n*[[Cersei Lannister]]\n*[[Jaime Lannister]]\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n*[[Janos Slynt]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Varys]]\n*[[Rhaenys Targaryen (daughter of Rhaegar)|Rhaenys Targaryen]]\n*[[Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaegar)|Aegon Targaryen]]\n*[[Hazzea]]\n*[[Aegon III Targaryen]]\n*[[Rhaenyra Targaryen]]\n*[[Aegon II Targaryen]]\n*[[Sallor]]\n*[[Prendahl na Ghezn]]\n|}\n\n==Places and Terms Mentioned==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[Meereen]]\n*[[Mazdhan\'s Maze]]\n*[[Naath]]\n*[[Basilisk Isles]]\n*[[Astapor]]\n*[[Yunkai]]\n*[[Westeros]]\n*[[Dragonstone]]\n*[[King\'s Landing]]\n*[[Slaver\'s Bay]]\n*[[Lhazar]]\n*[[Qarth]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[Gates of Fate]]\n*[[Dothraki Sea|Great Grass Sea]]/[[Dothraki Sea]]\n*[[White Sword Tower]]\n*[[Harvest Hall]]\n*[[Red Keep]]\n*[[River Gate]]/[[River Gate|Mud Gate]]\n*[[Gate of the Gods]]\n*[[Great Sept of Baelor]]\n*[[Great Pyramid]]\n*[[Harrenhal]]\n*[[Temple of the Graces]]\n*[[Skahazadhan]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[Khaleesi]]\n*[[Sons of the Harpy]]\n*[[Good Masters]]\n*[[Unsullied]]\n*[[Maiden (the Seven)|Maiden]]\n*[[Shavepates]]\n*[[Great Masters]]\n*[[House of Zhak]]\n*[[House of Merreq]]\n*\'\'[[arakh]]\'\'\n*[[Lamb Men]]\n*[[Balerion (ship)|Balerion]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[Bloody flux|Pale mare]]\n*[[Undying Ones]]\n*\'\'[[tokar]]\'\'\n*[[Faith of the Seven|Seven gods]]\n*[[Mother\'s Men]]\n*[[Free Brothers]]\n*[[Stalwart Shields]]\n*[[Andals]]\n*[[Rhoynar]]\n*[[First Men]]\n*[[Kingsguard]]\n*[[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard|Lord Commander]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[City Watch of King\'s Landing]]\n*[[Hand of the King]]\n*[[House Lannister]]\n*[[House Stark]]\n*[[Field of Fire]]\n*[[Dance of the Dragons]]\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 11]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Daenerys Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Meereen]]\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 11]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 12, Daenerys]]</text>\n      <sha1>srun3gftxvsoemyc9w951y2ycmiujfz</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 17</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5762</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>108862</id>\n      <parentid>99423</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2013-10-08T03:37:10Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Tyrus Madrox</username>\n        <id>5448</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <comment>/* Character List appearing/mentioned */</comment>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3596">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Arya Stark|Arya]]\n| title\t\t= Arya III\n| place         = [[Riverlands]]\n| page\t\t= 187\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 16|Sansa II]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 17|Arya III]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 18|Samwell I]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 13|Arya II]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 22|Arya IV]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Hot Pie]] has decided to stay with [[Sharna]] as a baker at the [[Inn of the Kneeling Man|inn]]. The others depart for [[Riverrun]], or so [[Tom of Sevenstreams|Tom]] tells [[Arya Stark|Arya]]. [[Harwin]] tells Arya the tale of how they first rode out in search of [[Gregor Clegane]], and about all the men they lost when Gregor\'s men fell on them. Most of the 120 men from the original group are dead, including [[Lothar Mallery]] and [[Gladden Wylde]]. It was all a trap; Lord [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] had planned for [[Eddard Stark|Eddard]] himself to ride out and deal with Gregor, but [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] didn\'t know of the plan when he attacked Ned in the streets of [[King\'s Landing]]. As Eddard\'s leg was broken, he had to send others out. [[Beric Dondarrion|Dondarrion]] and his men learned a sharp lesson when the trap sprung. Dondarrion should have died, having been run through with a lance, but [[Thoros of Myr]] saved him. After Tywin became [[Hand of the King]] they became outlaws themselves but they kept fighting in the name of [[Robert Baratheon|King Robert]]. They harried the foraging parties and attacked the baggage trains of Tywin\'s army, and their brotherhood began to grow as many flocked to their cause, mostly commoners uprooted by the war. \n\nLater, they meet up with [[Greenbeard]] and learn that Jaime Lannister has escaped from Riverrun. When Arya discovers that they mean to bring her before Lord Beric rather than take her to Riverrun, she tries to ride off, but Harwin catches her.

Rivers]] and his outriders. She learns that [[Robb Stark|Robb]] has crushed Ser [[Stafford Lannister]]\xe2\x80\x99s levies, and that the [[Jon Umber|Greatjon]] has seized three of the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]]\' gold mines. Robb reached [[Battle of Oxcross|Oxcross]] by following a trail [[Grey Wind]] had discovered around the [[Golden Tooth]]. However, Martyn tells her that Lord [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] is marching on Riverrun as they speak. Catelyn makes all haste back to her father [[Hoster Tully|Hoster\'s]] castle, but first takes [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]] as her sworn sword, to prevent the girl from doing anything foolish. Catelyn is fearful of her brother [[Edmure Tully|Edmure\'s]] chances in battle against Lord Tywin, and outside Riverrun discovers [[House Lannister guards|Lannister men]] hanging from the walls. Edmure informs her that four men from Ser [[Cleos Frey|Cleos\'s]] party attempted to free Ser [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]], and nearly succeeded. They were hanged for their deeds, and the Kingslayer was placed in the deep dungeons and chained to the wall. Her father\'s steward, [[Utherydes Wayn]], asks Catelyn if there is no hope of aid from the south, hoping that [[Stannis Baratheon]] will be forced to make common cause with them, but Catelyn gives no answer, since \'Stannis has made common cause with \'[[R\'hllor|a power greater and darker]]\'.\n\nEdmure also explains that birds have arrived from [[Storm\'s End]], with messages from Ser [[Cortnay Penrose]] seeking help. Cortnay  claimed he feared for the boy [[Edric Storm]], [[Robert I Baratheon|Robert\'s]] only known high-born bastard. Catelyn makes known her dissent in Edmure giving Lord Tywin battle. Her brother has commanded [[Roose Bolton]] to take [[Harrenhal]], and has also called the levies from the [[Twins]], those under the command of Ser [[Helman Tallhart]]. Catelyn argues that Robb left those men to make certain Lord [[Walder Frey|Walder]] kept faith. She learns that Roose wed [[Walda Frey|one of Lord Walder\'s daughters]].\n\nCatelyn then visits her father, but Lord Hoster mistakes her for [[Lysa Arryn|Lysa]], and mumbles several strange, disjointed lines, &quot;[[Jon Arryn|Jon]]\xe2\x80\x99s a good man\xe2\x80\xa6strong, kind\xe2\x80\xa6you\xe2\x80\x99ll wed when Catelyn does\xe2\x80\xa6That stripling\xe2\x80\xa6wretched boy\xe2\x80\xa6not speak that name to me, your duty\xe2\x80\xa6&quot;. Catelyn is then led by Utherydes to the [[silent sisters]] who possess Lord [[Eddard Stark|Eddard\'s]] bones. When she states that she must thank [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] for even this much, her father\'s steward tells her to thank the [[Tyrion Lannister|Imp]], since it was his doing. Catelyn thinks to herself &quot;One day I will thank them all&quot;.\n\nCatelyn commands the silent sisters to lay Ned\'s bones to rest in the [[crypts of Winterfell]], and then asks to be left alone with her husband\'s body, musing that she envies the silent sisters for their supposed ability to speak to the dead.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n\n* The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n*Summary and analyses of the chapter [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2012/01/re-read-catelyn-v-case-of-talking-heads.html in the course of a 10th reread].\n* [http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/05/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-18 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category:A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 39]]\n[[Category:A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Catelyn Tully]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Riverrun]]\n\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 39]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 40, Catelyn]]</text>\n      <sha1>37dnp6la9nyn7v8pmtjozrpv1hqdw5u</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Feast for Crows-Chapter 16</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5652</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166946</id>\n      <parentid>142434</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-06-05T19:12:15Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4921">{{Infobox Chapter AFfC\n| pov\t\t= [[Jaime Lannister]]\n| title\t\t= Jaime II\n| place         = [[King\'s Landing]]\n| page\t\t= 226\n| previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 15|Samwell II]]\n| current\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 16|Jaime II]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 17|Cersei IV]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 8|Jaime I]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 27|Jaime III]]\n}}\n   \n==Synopsis==\nAn honor procession flanks Lord [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]\'s casket as it heads west, led by many of the Lannister bannermen.&lt;ref&gt;The sigils mentioned match Houses [[House Crakehall|Crakehall]], [[House Lydden|Lydden]], [[House Bettley|Bettley]], [[House Sarsfield|Sarsfield]], [[House Prester|Prester]], [[House Yarwyck|Yarwyck]], [[House Stackspear|Stackspear]], [[House Myatt|Myatt]], [[House Turnberry|Turnberry]], [[House Hamell|Hamell]] and [[House Kenning of Kayce|Kenning]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] falls in with his uncle [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]], and they discuss the attack on [[Saltpans]]. Jaime cautions his uncle not to try and take on [[Sandor Clegane]] or [[Beric Dondarrion]], and that he would have made a good [[Hand of the King|Hand]]. Kevan rejects him coolly, and lets Jaime know he knows about the relationship of the twins. \n\nAs Jaime returns to [[King\'s Landing]], he looks upon the encamped Lannister army, which will soon board the [[House Redwyne|Redwynes\']] fleet to lay siege to [[Dragonstone]]. He finds his sister in her solar as Grand Maester [[Pycelle]] delivers news that Ser [[Bronn]] has named [[Lollys Stokeworth|Lollys]]\'s bastard newborn &quot;[[Tyrion Tanner|Tyrion]]&quot;. Jaime realizes that his sister may try to have Bronn killed for this jape, and he recalls the look on her face the night of [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]]\'s wedding when the [[Tower of the Hand]] was aflame. This called to mind the madness of King [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys]] and the way he would become arosed by fire. Jaime recalls Aerys\' rape of [[Rhaella Targaryen|his wife]] the evening he had Lord [[Qarlton Chelsted|Chelsted]] burned alive. Jaime had the guard of the queen\'s bedchamber when she was screaming for her husband to stop. When Jaime said that they were sworn to protect her too, his partner that night, Ser [[Jonothor Darry]], replied, &quot;We are, but not from him.&quot;\n\nJaime asks to speak with Cersei alone, and asks her why she keeps Lady [[Taena of Myr|Taena]] around all the time, knowing that she is a spy for [[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]]. Cersei responds that Taena is more her spy, considering that the Queen Regent can do more for the [[House Merryweather|Merryweather family]]. Jaime cautions that she doesn\'t truly know the woman, but Cersei remarks that she may make [[Orton Merryweather|Taena\'s husband]] the Hand. After Jaime asks her about the rumor that she plans to name [[Aurane Waters]] her new master of ships, he recommends that she would be better off naming [[Paxter Redwyne]]. But Cersei will not put any Tyrell vassals on her small council. Cersei also defends her choice of [[Qyburn]], a disgraced and twisted maester, to join the council. Cersei\'s growing paranoia and brutality are becoming more evident and Jaime retorts, &quot;You are seeing dwarfs in every shadow and making foes of friends. Uncle Kevan is not your enemy. \'\'I\'\' am not your enemy.&quot; However, Cersei throws him out of her solar in fury.\n\nIn the White Sword Tower, Jaime speaks with [[Loras Tyrell]], asking him what he knows of certain famous kingsguard. Ser Loras is well-versed, but when the Lord Commander mentions some lesser-known Kingsguard, the Knight of Flowers does not recognize their names. Jaime points out that all of them served well, perhaps even better than the famous knights.

He is interrupted by [[Osha]], who tells him about the [[old gods]] and the [[Others]]. She insists that [[Robb Stark|Robb]] should be marching north not south. Bran passes on her advice to Maester [[Luwin]]. Then Robb marches his army south.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Bran Stark|Bran]] watches from a guard turret with [[Maester]] [[Luwin]]\xe2\x80\x99s fareye as the [[House Karstark|Karstark]] forces arrive at [[Winterfell]]. When [[Robb Stark|Robb]] heard the news that [[Eddard Stark|their father]] had been taken captive in [[King\'s Landing]], he called the Stark bannermen together for war. The Karstarks are the last to arrive: three hundred horsemen and near two thousand foot lead by Lord [[Rickard Karstark]] with his sons [[Harrion Karstark|Harrion]], [[Eddard Karstark|Eddard]], and [[Torrhen Karstark|Torrhen]] riding beside him. The Karstarks are said to have Stark blood in them, going back hundreds of years, but the fierce men do not look like Starks to Bran.\n\nBran has not been allowed to leave the castle since the [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 37|incident]] in the [[wolfswood]]. Robb insists that there are no men available to guard him and is not dissuaded by Bran\xe2\x80\x99s argument that [[Summer (direwolf)|Summer]] will protect him. The incident in the Wolfswood shames Bran as he is not able to protect himself; even [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]] would have been able to kick them. A year ago he would have visited the village anyway, climbing over the walls, but now he can only watch with Maester Luwin and [[Hodor]]. \n\nMaester Luwin has taught Bran all the banners and now he has faces to associate with them. Bran asks how many knights there are and Luwin tells Bran that there are over 12,000 men, but only 300 knights because [[the North]] holds to the [[old gods]] and knights are anointed in a sept of the [[Faith of the Seven]]. However, Luwin assures him, &quot;a man\xe2\x80\x99s worth is not marked by a [[Knight|ser]] before his name.&quot; Bran asks when they will leave and is told they must leave soon or the countryside will be eaten clean. Robb has a long way to go and the fighting has started. More men will join Robb as he travels south. \n\nBran tells Hodor that he does not want to watch anymore. Maester Luwin reminds Bran that his brother is busy greeting the Karstarks, but Bran assures him that he wants to visit the [[godswood]]. Hodor now carries Bran in a basket strapped to his back, an idea Luwin got from the baskets used by the serving women to carry firewood. Being carried this way does not shame Bran the same as being carried like a baby, although Hodor sometimes forgets Bran is on his back when going through doorways. \n\nWhen Bran exits the castle there are Karstark men arriving. Some men mock him, but Bran has been warned of this by the maester. His attitude is to let them mock since he does not want to stay in his bedroom. Bran calls for Summer, and the Karstark horses reel as the [[direwolf]] goes by.\n\nWhen Bran arrives in the godswood, he pulls himself out of his seat on Hodor\xe2\x80\x99s back using a branch of the [[weirwood]]. Then he lets Hodor lower him down beside the water and says he wants to be alone with Summer. Bran has been finding himself drawn more to the [[heart tree]] and now he takes comfort from its deep red eyes; the old gods are watching over him. He feels safe and it gives him time to think, which he has been doing a lot of recently. \n\nBran prays for Robb not to go away, for the safety of his family, and for [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]] to understand. Rickon has grown wild and violent since he learned that Robb was leaving. Once Rickon disappeared and, when he was finally found down in the crypts, the youngest Stark had slashed at the men with a sword and [[Shaggydog]] bit [[Gage]] on the arm and took a chunk out of [[Mikken]]\xe2\x80\x99s thigh. It took Robb and [[Grey Wind]] to bring Shaggydog under control. After that [[Farlen]] chained Shaggydog in the kennels and now Rickon cries even more. \n\n[[File:Greatjon Umber by amoka.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Greatjon Umber - by Amok \xc2\xa9]]\n\nLuwin and Bran have both asked Robb to stay but he refuses, saying he has no choice. Bran believes this is only half a lie because Robb could send someone else to guard [[the Neck]]. Robb\xe2\x80\x99s response was that their father would not send others to die while he stayed behind the walls of Winterfell. Robb denies all who request being given supreme battle command. Many of the lords try to test Robb by making demands, but he is able to handle them much as his father did and bend them to his will, even when anger flares. When [[Jon Umber (Greatjon)|Greatjon Umber]] demanded the right to command, he drew his sword against Robb. [[Grey Wind]] immediately reacted by biting off two of his fingers. Since the incident, the Greatjon has been Robb\xe2\x80\x99s staunchest supporter. That night, Robb came to Bran\xe2\x80\x99s bedchamber pale and shaken. Robb also told Bran that the most frightening bannerman is [[Roose Bolton]], who never says a word but only looks at him. When Bolton does this, all Robb can think of is the room in the [[Dreadfort]] where the Boltons hang the skins of their enemies. Bran states that this is only a story of [[Old Nan]]\xe2\x80\x99s, but then asks for confirmation. \n\nThere are many horrible stories that come with travelers, and it is impossible to say which is real, although some are obviously untrue. Then the letter from Sansa arrived with the seal of House Stark. After Robb had read the letter he crushed it. Sansa had said nothing of Arya and Robb asked what is wrong with her. Bran replied that Sansa has lost her wolf, remembering the day four of the guardsmen returned with bones of [[Lady (direwolf)|Lady]]. They buried the bones in the cemetery with the faithful servants of Winterfell; she went south and only her bones returned, like Lord [[Rickard Stark]], [[Brandon Stark]], and two hundred men, and none returned. Now [[Eddard Stark|their father]], [[Arya Stark|Arya]], [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]], [[Jory Cassel]], and [[Tomard|Fat Tom]] have gone south and not come back and later [[Catelyn Tully|mother]] and Ser [[Rodrik Cassel|Rodrik]] left and have not come back. Now Robb is going south and it frightens Bran. Bran prays that the gods look after Robb and his men going south, and that they defeat the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] and bring Father back.\n\n[[File:Osha.jpg|thumb|165px|right|Osha the wildling- by Amok \xc2\xa9]]\n\nBran is surprised by words from [[Osha]] who is apparently able to move quietly in the shackles she has to wear. She tells him that she can hear the gods answering him. When Summer comes around the pool to sniff her, she flinches. Bran calls Summer back and asks Osha, whom he has not seen since she was taken captive, what she is doing here. The [[spearwife]] replies they are her gods too and the only gods beyond [[the Wall]]. Bran notes that she looks more womanly with her longer hair and her dress of brown roughspun. She tells Bran that [[Gage]] lets her out to do her prayers from time to time while she lets him do what he wants under her skirt when he feels the need; it is nothing to her, she likes the smell of flour on his hands and he is gentler than [[Stiv]]. \n\nShe offers to leave but Bran asks her to stay and tell him what she means about hearing the gods. She tells him to open his ears, to which Bran replies that it is only the wind. Osha asks him who sends the winds, insisting that the old gods can see him and hear his words. Bran asks what they say and Osha replies that they are sad because they cannot help his brother in the South. The old gods have no power there because all the weirwoods were destroyed thousands of years ago; they cannot watch over his brother because they have no eyes. \n\nNow Bran listens and it seems there is sadness in the wind, but then he only hears Hodor, who arrives naked from his bath in the hot springs. When Osha sees Hodor she declares that his size denotes [[Giants|giant]] blood in him. When Bran tells her that Maester Luwin taught him that there are no more giants, Osha tells him that the Maester should ride beyond the [[Wall]]. The giants sometimes breed with men [[beyond the Wall]], producing half-breeds, though it goes much worse on the women that have sex with a giant. She then asks Bran if he knows what she is talking about and he tells her does, as he has seen animals mating. \n\nAs Hodor leaves to dress at Bran\xe2\x80\x99s command, Bran admits that he is very big. Osha confirms there are giants beyond the Wall, and worse than giants: when men leave their fires they often do not come back, or sometimes they come back as [[wights]] with blue eyes and cold black hands. Osha explains that she tried to tell Robb, Maester Luwin, and even [[Theon Greyjoy]] of this, but they would not listen. She asks Bran why else she would flee south in the company of Stiv and the rest of those fools. She goes on to declare that [[Mance Rayder]], once a sworn brother of the [[Night\'s Watch]], thinks he can fight the wights. Osha states that she, unlike Mance, is of the north, from a long line of the [[free folk]]. Osha laments again that she cannot get Robb to listen and Bran suggests that perhaps Robb will listen to him. Osha is dubious but gives Bran the message: \n\n{{Quote|You tell him this, m\xe2\x80\x99lord. You tell him he\xe2\x80\x99s bound on marching the wrong way. It\'s north he should be taking his swords. North, not south.}}\n\nBran does not get to tell his brother this, because Robb takes his meal in the solar with the great lords to make final plans for the march, while Bran has to act as the host to the Karstarks in the [[Winterfell#The Great Hall|Great Hall]]. When he arrives in the hall, Bran can feel the eyes on him and hears them murmuring about him being broken. He whispers under his breath that he wants to be a knight, which Maester Luwin overhears. He tells Bran that some call his order the \xe2\x80\x9cknights of the mind,\xe2\x80\x9d and that Bran could forge a maester\xe2\x80\x99s chain at the [[Citadel]] in [[Oldtown]]. Bran states that he wants to learn magic and that the [[Three-eyed crow|crow]] promised he would fly. The maester says he can teach Bran many things but no one can teach him magic. Bran replies that the [[children of the forest]] could teach him. Then he remembers what he promised Osha, and tells the maester of the threat in the north. The maester promises to talk to Osha, but it is obvious even to Bran that what he has said has made little impression.\n\nTwo days later, Robb and his army march south. Robb tells Bran that now he must be the lord, the Stark in Winterfell. Bran\xe2\x80\x94who has never felt so little, alone, or scared\xe2\x80\x94does not know how to be a lord. He is told to listen to Maester Luwin and to take care of Rickon who has refused to say goodbye, claiming that no one ever comes back. Robb states that Mother will be home soon and promises to bring Father back. As Robb\xe2\x80\x99s force leaves, Bran remembers Osha\xe2\x80\x99s words: he is marching the wrong way. Then he hears the cheers from the village, and thinks they will never cheer for him. All that seems to be left in Winterfell are women, children, old men, and Hodor.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/09/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-26 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/054/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 53]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Bran Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Winterfell]]\n\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 53]][[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 54, Bran]][[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\x91\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0\xd0\xbd VI]]</text>\n      <sha1>gfbbfhb443b8kivujsltu0b4tlcv1x2</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Game of Thrones-Chapter 25</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5990</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>183419</id>\n      <parentid>165968</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-04-28T19:15:21Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8780">{{Infobox Chapter AGoT\n| pov\t\t= [[Eddard Stark]]\n| place         = [[King\'s Landing]]\n| title\t\t= Eddard V\n| page\t\t= \n| previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 24|Bran IV]]\n| current\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 25|Eddard V]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 26|Jon IV]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 20|Eddard IV]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 27|Eddard VI]]\n}} __NOTOC__\n\t\n[[Eddard Stark|Ned]] speaks with [[Maesters|Grand Maester]] [[Pycelle]] about Lord [[Jon Arryn]]\xe2\x80\x99s final days. On his way back, he finds [[Arya Stark|Arya]] training to be a [[water dancer]] on the steps of the [[Tower of the Hand]]. Later, he is visited by [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] who has found four of Lord Arryn\xe2\x80\x99s household remaining in [[King\'s Landing]].\n\n==Synopsis==\t\n\n[[File:Grand Maester Pycelle.jpg|thumb|170px|left|Grand Maester Pycelle - \xc2\xa9 Amok]]\n\n[[Eddard Stark|Ned]] meets with Grand [[Maester]] [[Pycelle]] in the stifling heat that has covered the city. Pycelle talks about how the smallfolk claim that the last year of summer is the hottest. The Grand Maester goes on to say that he does not believe this, noting that the King Maekar\xe2\x80\x99s Summer was even hotter and broke in the seventh year, leading to a short autumn and a terrible long winter. Then Pycelle digresses about being a young man, forging his maester\xe2\x80\x99s chain during the reign of King [[Maekar I Targaryen|Maekar I]].\n\nFinally, Pycelle remembers that Ned asked about [[Jon Arryn]] and explains that Lord Arryn was melancholy but healthy, then suddenly became ill. He had asked Pycelle about a [[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms|book]], and  Pycelle remembers noting that something was troubling him. The next day, Lord Arryn was twisted over in pain, unable to get out of bed. Ned mentions that he has heard that Pycelle sent away Lord Arryn\xe2\x80\x99s maester. Pycelle states that this was because he felt Maester [[Colemon]] didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand the older body and was endangering Lord Arryn\'s life with purging potions. \n\nNed asks if Lord Arryn had any final words. Pycelle responds that Jon Arryn called out the name \xe2\x80\x9cRobert\xe2\x80\x9d several times, but does not know if he was talking about [[Robert Baratheon|the king]] or [[Robert Arryn|his son]]. His last words were whispered to [[Lysa Arryn]] and King Robert: &quot;The seed is strong.&quot; \n\nNext, Ned asks if there was anything unnatural about the death, and follows up by asking if Pycelle had seen anything like this illness before. Pycelle states that he has seen more of illness than he would like to remember and that every illness is different and yet alike. Eventually, Pycelle says that Jon Arryn\xe2\x80\x99s death was no stranger than any other. When Ned mentions that Lysa thinks otherwise, Pycelle says that grief can derange minds--and Lysa\xe2\x80\x99s mind was not the best before, seeing enemies in every corner. \n\nWhen Ned suggests that Jon Arryn could have been poisoned, the Grand Maester rebuffs him, asking who would do such a thing. Ned replies that he has heard poison is a woman\xe2\x80\x99s weapon. Pycelle replies that poison is the preferred weapon of women, cravens, and eunuchs. He continues by telling Ned that [[Varys]] was born a slave in [[Lys]], and that Ned shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t trust him. Ned scarcely needs reminding, as he already has a bad feeling about Varys.\n\nNed excuses himself but the Grand Maester halts him to offer any other service Ned may require. Ned uses the opportunity to ask for the book Jon Arryn asked for. Pycelle says it is a ponderous tome of lineages that Ned would find boring. Ned insists he would like to see the book in any case, and Pycelle promises to send it to him once he finds it. On the way out, Ned also learns that Queen [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] was not in [[King\'s Landing]] when Jon Arryn died. Pycelle\xe2\x80\x99s parting words are \xe2\x80\x9cI am here to serve,\xe2\x80\x9d leading Ned to think, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, but whom.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOn his return to the [[Tower of the Hand]], Ned finds [[Arya Stark|Arya]] on the steps, standing on one foot. When Ned asks what she is doing she tells him that [[Syrio Forel]] says that a [[water dancer]] can stand on one toe for hours. Ned expresses his concern about her falling down the steps but Arya states that a water dancer never falls. Then Arya asks if [[Bran Stark|Bran]] will come to live with them now, and Ned responds that first he must grow stronger. Speaking of Bran leads Ned to recall taking the girls to the castle [[godswood]] to offer their thanks when the news of Bran\xe2\x80\x99s recovery arrived. The girls had gone to sleep and dreamed of Bran while Ned stood vigil all night.\n\n[[File:Brittmartin Littlefinger.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Littlefinger - by BrittMartin \xc2\xa9 Green Ronin Publishing]]\n\nWhile balancing on her leg, Arya asks about Bran\xe2\x80\x99s plans to be a knight of the [[Kingsguard]]. Ned admits that Bran won\'t become a knight, but he may become a lord, a councilor, an architect, an explorer, or even the [[High Septon]], even while privately noting that Bran will never lie with a woman or father a son. When Arya asks if she can do any of these things, Ned says that she will marry a king and her sons will do these things. Arya replies that that is [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]], not her.\n\nLater, Ned meets with [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] in his solar. Littlefinger, who is watching the Kingsguard practicing in the yard below, starts with small talk about who might win the tourney. This does not interest Ned at all, so he asks Littlefinger to get to the point. Ned cannot find it in himself to trust Littlefinger. Littlefinger tells him that four of Jon Arryn\xe2\x80\x99s household are still in the city, which surprises Ned, who thought that all had gone back to the [[Eyrie]] with Lysa.\n\nLittlefinger reveals the names, which include Jon Arryn\'s squire, Ser [[Hugh]] of the Vale. He also reveals that Ser Hugh was knighted by the king after Lord Arryn died. Ned states that he will send for them, but Littlefinger does not think this is a good idea and asks Ned to come to the window. Littlefinger identifies some of the spies among those outside his window: one is Varys\xe2\x80\x99, the other is the queen\xe2\x80\x99s. He tells Ned that there are others, and some even he does not know. He cautions Ned to send a man he trusts completely to question these people rather than doing it himself; even Varys cannot watch every man in Ned\'s service every hour of the day. As Littlefinger departs, Ned expresses his gratitude and says he was perhaps wrong to distrust him. Littlefinger fingers his beard and replies that distrusting him is the wisest thing Ned has done since he climbed down off his horse.\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n*Maester [[Pycelle]]\n*[[Arya Stark]]\n*[[Alyn]]\n*[[Petyr Baelish]]\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Jon Arryn]]\n*[[Maekar Targaryen]]\n*[[Robert Arryn]]\n*[[Lysa Tully]]\n*Maester [[Colemon]]\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n*[[Cersei Lannister]]\n*[[Aerys II Targaryen]]\n*[[Jaehaerys II Targaryen]]\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Aegon V Targaryen]]\n*[[Catelyn Stark]]\n*Maester [[Aethelmure]]\n*Lord [[Varys]]\n*Maester [[Malleon]]\n*[[Tywin Lannister]]\n*[[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n*[[Jaime Lannister]]\n*[[Old Nan]]\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Maester Luwin]]\n*[[Bran Stark]]\n*[[Syrio Forel]]\n*[[Sansa Stark]]\n*[[Brandon the Builder]]\n*[[Barristan Selmy]]\n*[[Sandor Clegane]]\n*[[Renly Baratheon]]\n*[[Hugh]] of the Vale\n|}\n\n==Terms and places mentioned==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[Citadel]]\n*[[Oldtown]]\n*[[Seven Kingdoms]]\n*[[Free Cities]]\n*[[Lys]]\n*[[Casterly Rock]]\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[Tower of the Hand]]\n*[[Winterfell]]\n*[[Sunset Sea]]\n*[[King\'s Landing]]\n*[[Eyrie]]\n*[[Valyria]]\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[Great Summer]]\n*[[Milk of the poppy]]\n*[[Godswood]]\n*[[Weirwood]]\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[Kingsguard]]\n*[[Faith of the Seven]]\n*[[High Septon]]\n*[[City Watch of King\'s Landing|City Watch]]\n|}\n\n==References and Notes==\n* The synopsis was copied from AoL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\t\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/06/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-13 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/026/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 25]]\t\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Eddard Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 26, Eddard]][[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\xad\xd0\xb4\xd0\xb4\xd0\xb0\xd1\x80\xd0\xb4 V]]</text>\n      <sha1>lm0t4hueyjov3r3ekcjumqvclxegooi</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 61</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6925</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>183422</id>\n      <parentid>166639</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-04-28T19:15:59Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7227">{{Infobox Chapter ADwD\n| pov\t\t= [[Jon Connington]]\n| place         = [[Griffin\'s Roost]]\n| title\t\t= The Griffin Reborn\n| page\t\t= 801\n| previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 60|The Spurned Suitor]]\n| current\t= The Griffin Reborn\n| next\t\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 62|The Sacrifice]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 24|The Lost Lord]]\n| arc next\t= \n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:Daniel ClarkeGreyscale.png|300px|thumb|left|[[Jon Connington]] has been infected with greyscale. \xc2\xa9 Fantasy Flight Games]]\n[[Jon Connington]] and the [[Golden Company]] have landed at [[Cape Wrath]] in [[Westeros]], and manage to seize [[Griffin\'s Roost]] and other small castles by taking them unawares.

Any raven trying to leave the castle was shot down, followed shortly by the castle\'s [[maester]] being thrown from his tower. After that, what was left of the garrison surrendered.\n\nTaking his leave of the Golden Company officers by claiming to be going to pray at his father\'s tomb in the castle sept, Jon instead goes to the battlements and reminisces over the time [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]] visited his home and seemed impressed with Connington\'s lands. Jon then reflects on what happened next to [[House Connington|his House]]; after [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys]] exiled Jon, furious at his failure to stop Robert, the lands and title went to his cousin [[Ronald Connington]] (who had been Jon\'s castellan while he was in [[King\'s Landing]]) but after the end of [[Robert\'s Rebellion]], [[Robert Baratheon|King Robert]] stripped Ronald of his lordship and gave most of House Connington\'s lands to houses that had fought for him. Jon, however, is glad that he will not have to fight his deceased cousin or Ronald\'s son [[Ronnet Connington|Ronnet]], who is away fighting in the Riverlands, to reclaim Griffin\'s Roost, not wanting to celebrate his return by killing one of his own kin. Nor does he blame his cousin any longer for taking advantage of his downfall, since as far as Jon is concerned, the one responsible for House Connington\'s downfall is himself.\n\nJon\'s musings then turn to where he lost everything: [[Stoney Sept]]. Taking over pursuit of Robert from the [[House Tyrell|Tyrells]] after the [[Battle of Ashford]], Jon cornered the rebel in the town and began searching for him. But the search yielded nothing, as the townsfolk were protecting Robert, hiding him and constantly moving him. All of Connington\'s efforts to find Robert- offering bribes for information, taking hostages, threats and pardons- got him nowhere, and the delays bought time for [[Eddard Stark]] and [[Hoster Tully]] to bring a rebel army to Robert\'s rescue. The rebels attacked Connington\'s men at the same time Robert and his followers emerged from the town in a counterattack, and the [[Battle of the Bells|ensuing battle]] ended in a rebel victory. For years, Jon reflects that he insisted he did all he could, until [[Myles Toyne]] disabused him of that notion by pointing out that [[Tywin Lannister]] would have burned Stoney Sept to the ground to kill Robert, then offered pardons to Stark and Tully when they arrived to convince them to give up and go home. Connington, however, knew this would mean killing everyone in the town, and he both didn\'t want to be branded a murderer and wanted the glory of slaying Robert for himself. Jon reflects that his failure at Stoney Sept led to Rhaegar\'s death at the Trident and vows not to fail Prince Aegon as he failed his father.\n\nRe-joining his fellows, Jon takes note of the captives, including Ronnet\'s brother, sister and bastard son. Most of the castle staff swear loyalty to him.  Connington pays a visit to [[Haldon]], who is trying to interpret where most of the Golden Company, scattered along the coast by the Volantene ships that transported them from [[Essos]] to send a message to [[Doran Martell]] to inform him that his nephew [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaegar)|Aegon]] is alive, in order to gain the Dornish alliance. Jon reflects that he could not have expected loyalty from these men if he had reclaimed his home while [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] and [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]] still held the Stormlands. Haldon also argues that they need to offer incentives to convince recalcitrant lords to join them-as most of the gold and land will go to the Golden Company officers that was taken from their ancestors, Haldon suggests offering the hands of Prince Aegon and Jon himself for marriage alliances. Jon, however refuses, in the face of his illness and his insistence that Aegon must be free to wed [[Daenerys Targaryen]] if she ever returns home. In his chambers, Jon privately treats his [[greyscale]] with wine. If his condition became known, he fears that any lords still loyal to [[House Connington]] would abandon him.\n\nFour days later, Prince Aegon arrives along with [[Rolly Duckfield|Duck]], the first member of his [[Kingsguard]]. Jon recalls his disapproval of that choice and how he argued with Aegon that they should leave places in his Kingsguard open to both warriors of great renown or the younger sons of important lords to add lustre to their cause, but Aegon refused, saying all he wanted from his Kingsguard was their willingness to die defending him, pointing out that Jon\'s criteria for the Kingsguard perfectly fits [[Jaime Lannister|the Kingslayer]]. Jon informs him that his men plan to take [[Storm\'s End]] in ten days (he had refused the suggestions of the Golden Company officers to make an alliance with [[Stannis Baratheon]], who holds it, arguing that Stannis is Robert\'s brother, a rival claimant to the throne and leagues away from them with nothing to offer). Aegon agrees to this plan, and tells him that he intends for the siege to go forward with one change: Aegon will lead the attack himself.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n* [[Jon Connington | Jon Connington (Griff)]]\n* [[Balaq|Black Balaq]]\n* [[Harry Strickland]]\n* [[Franklyn Flowers]]\n* [[Malo Jayn]]\n* [[Brendel Byrne]]\n* [[Haldon|Haldon Halfmaester]]\n* [[Rhaegar Targaryen]]\n* [[Armond Connington]]\n* [[Lester Morrigen|Lord Morrigen]]\n* [[Aerys II Targaryen]]\n* [[Ronald Connington]]\n* [[Robert Baratheon]]\n* [[Ronnet Connington]]\n* [[Eddard Stark]]\n* [[Hoster Tully]]\n* [[Tywin Lannister]]\n* [[Myles Toyne]]\n* [[Jaime Lannister]]\n* [[Raymund Connington]]\n* [[Alynne Connington]]\n* [[Ronald Storm]]\n* [[Renly Baratheon]]\n* [[Stannis]]\n* [[Tristan Rivers]]\n* [[Laswell Peake]]\n* [[Gorys Edoryen]]\n* [[Cersei Lannister]]\n* [[Margaery Tyrell]]\n* [[Mace Tyrell]]\n* [[Myrcella Baratheon]]\n* [[Doran Martell]]\n* [[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n* [[Elia Martell]]\n* [[Rhaenys Targaryen]]\n* [[Lemore|Lady Lemore]]\n* [[Lymond Pease]]\n* [[Dick Cole]]\n* [[Marq Mandrake]]\n* [[Tommen]]\n* [[Lysono Maar]]\n* [[Rolly Duckfield]]\n* [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaegar)]]\n}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 61]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Jon Connington]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in the Stormlands]]\n\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 61]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 62, Le griffon ressuscit\xc3\xa9]]</text>\n      <sha1>2sly206vdd1l6z86xy5sihy8vwoiz54</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Clash of Kings-Chapter 9</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6234</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166406</id>\n      <parentid>129430</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-23T20:44:04Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7788">{{Infobox Chapter ACfK\n| pov\t\t= [[Arya Stark]]\n| place         = South of the [[Gods Eye]]\n| title\t\t= Arya III\n| page\t\t= 101\n| previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 8|Tyrion II]]\n| current\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 9|Arya III]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 10|Davos I]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 5|Arya II]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 14|Arya IV]]\n}}\n\n[[Arya Stark|Arya]] and the others have abandoned the [[kingsroad]] to avoid the [[City Watch of King\'s Landing|gold cloaks]]. As they travel west they come upon a burned village. When Arya goes to make water in the forest, she runs into a wolf pack, which scares her. She reports this to [[Yoren]], who laments they should have taken a ship instead.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe road [[Arya Stark|Arya]] and the other travel is now little more than two ruts through the weeds and the human flood has slowed to a trickle, so there is no one to say which way they go. However, the road wanders back and forth, tangles with other trails, and sometimes vanishes entirely. Arya hates it. The terrain is gentle enough, but even so the path is narrow enough that the wagons slow their pace to a crawl. A dozen times a day they must stop to free a wheel or double up the teams to climb a muddy slope. \n\nArya constantly looks over her shoulder, wondering when the [[City Watch of King\'s Landing|gold cloaks]] will catch them. She does not trust their sentries, especially the orphan boys, who seem lost out in the woods. Arya can sneak past any of them when she goes off in the night to make water alone. Once she snuck right up to [[Lommy Greenhands]] and considered jumping on him, but changed her mind at the thought of [[Yoren]] punishing her again.\n\nThe orphans all treat [[Gendry]] like someone special because the queen wants his head. Gendry will have none of it, though. He insists he was only an apprentice armorer until Master [[Tobho Mott]] told him he was to join the [[Night\'s Watch]]. Then he goes off to polish his bull helm, but never wears it. Lommy guesses Gendry is the &quot;[[Eddard Stark|wolf lord]]\'s&quot; bastard, which angers Arya, who knows [[Jon Snow]] is her father\'s only bastard. She wishes she could ride home alone, but she knows that would mean no one to scout ahead, watch behind, stand guard while she sleeps, and help her fight off the gold cloaks.\n\nYoren decides the [[kingsroad]] will not be safe until they cross the [[Trident]], so they intend to travel around the west (far) side of [[Gods Eye]]. Settlements and farmland gives way to forest and the terrain grows rougher. Their provisions soon run out, so Yoren turns to the poachers [[Koss]] and [[Kurz]] to range ahead to hunt, and the younger boys are set to pick berries and plunder orchards along the road. Arya is a skilled climber and a fast picker, and one day she comes across a rabbit, which Yoren stews. Everyone else gets a spoonful, but Arya gets a whole leg and shares it with Gendry.\n\nAt [[Briarwhite]], some fieldhands force them to pay for the sweetcorn they have taken. Yoren gives them some coppers, but complains that brothers of the Night\'s Watch used to be feasted throughout the realm, even by high lords. That night, Yoren is too angry to eat and only paces around the camp, muttering to himself. After that they find men guarding the fields more and more.\n\nThe next day, Koss reports a camp of twenty or thirty men in mail and halfhelms armed with spears. Some of the men are wounded or dying and they have only one horse, which is lame. The soldiers carry a banner of a [[House Myatt|spotted treecat]], which Yoren cannot identify. They go wide around the camp, since the men might be desperate enough to take their horses or worse. The detour costs them two days at least, but Yoren insists they will spend the rest of their lives at [[the Wall]], so there is no rush to get there.\n\nOne evening, [[Dobber]] spies a fire on the northern horizon. As night falls the fire seems to grow brighter until it looks as if the whole north is ablaze. From time to time they can smell the smoke, but the wind holds steady and the flames never get any closer. By morning the fire has burned out, but no one has slept very well. \n\nIt is midday when they come upon the remains of a village. The fields are scorched for miles around and there are burnt bodies everywhere. Leaving the rest to guard the wagons, Yoren takes [[Murch]] and [[Cutjack]] to investigate the ruined holdfast. When Arya turns to Gendry he has his helmet on. After a long time, Yoren returns with a [[Weasel|little girl]] and a woman whose right forearm is missing. The girl only cries and the woman only whimpers, &quot;Please,&quot; over and over again. [[Rorge]] thinks this is funny and he and [[Biter]] laugh until Murch curses them and tells them to shut up. \n\nThey fix the woman a place in a wagon. [[Hot Pie]] murmurs that he is scared and Arya admits she is too. Hot Pie admits he never actually kicked a boy to death, he just sold his mother\'s pies. Arya rides as far ahead of the wagons as she dares to get away from the little girl crying and the woman whispering. The one-armed woman dies at evenfall, and Gendry and Cutjack bury her on a hillside beneath a weeping willow. When the wind blows, Arya thinks she can hear the tree\'s branches whispering, &quot;Please,&quot; over and over, which frightens her badly.\n\nThat night, Yoren orders no fire, so supper is sparse and Arya fills her belly with water instead. When she wakes it is pitch-black and her bladder is full to bursting. As she is leaving to make water, Hot Pie is on guard and insists Yoren ordered everyone to stay close. When Arya explains her need, Hot Pie tells her to use a nearby tree and explains that he heard wolves earlier. Rather than fight with him, Arya acts afraid and pretends to go back to sleep until Hot Pie leaves, then sneaks into the woods on the other side of the camp. Just to make sure, she goes out twice as far as usual. As she is doing her business, Arya hears a rustling and sees the eyes shining out from the wood. She grabs for [[Needle]] and counts the eyes of a whole pack. One wolf comes forward and bares his teeth, but then retreats into the darkness and the wolves leave.\n\nShe follows the sound of Yoren sharpening his knife back to camp. She climbs into the back of a wagon with him and tells him there are wolves in the woods. Yoren is unperturbed, and comments that he thought Arya\'s [[House Stark|kind]] were fond of wolves. Arya tells him about her [[direwolf]] [[Nymeria (direwolf)|Nymeria]] and how she was forced to drive her off. Yoren comments that the only wolves they have to fear are the human kind, like the ones who burned that village. He wonders aloud if he should have left them all back in the city where it seems safer. Arya insists that she wants to go home. Yoren replies that he has been bringing men to the Wall for nearly thirty years and only lost three, but this time he should have taken a ship.\n\nYoren tells Arya to get some sleep, and she tries, but she can hear the wolves howling, and fainter than that she hears what might be screams.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n\n* [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2011/05/re-read-arya-iii-squatting-before.html Review of the chapter] in the course of a tenth reread. \n*[http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2010/03/tyrion-arya.html Humorous review and summary of the chapter] by Jason.\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/02/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-5 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 09]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Arya Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place by the Gods Eye]]\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 9]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 10, Arya]]</text>\n      <sha1>1j2wuvuihek505dx5liogelykelwhai</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 24</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6830</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>181035</id>\n      <parentid>166561</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-02-16T19:51:43Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5890">{{Infobox Chapter ADwD\n| pov\t\t= [[Jon Connington]]\n| place         = [[Volon Therys]]\n| title\t\t= The Lost Lord\n| page\t\t= 306\n| previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 23|Daenerys IV]]\n| current\t= The Lost Lord\n| next\t\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 25|The Windblown]]\n| arc previous\t= \n| arc next\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 61|The Griffin Reborn]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\nAfter the disappearance of [[Tyrion Lannister]],{{Ref|aDwD|22}} Lord [[Jon Connington]] decided to continue their route to [[Volon Therys]]. There, the former lord of [[Griffin\'s Roost]], [[Haldon]] and Prince [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaegar)|Aegon]] arrive at the camp of the mercenary [[Golden Company]] to meet their officers.\n\nOn their way, the man called Griff recalls memories of the time when he served with the mercenaries himself - the Golden Company was founded by former combatants and knights of the [[Seven Kingdoms]] who were defeated in the [[Blackfyre Rebellion]]. Jon Connington joined the Golden Company after his own defeat at the [[Battle of the Bells]], at [[Stoney Sept]], when he failed to capture the then-rebel [[Robert Baratheon]], seventeen years ago. It is revealed that Connington was dismissed from the Golden Company for ostensibly stealing from their war chest, but in reality left their service as part of a plan staged by Lord [[Varys]] to make his ignominious dismissal more forgettable. The Company was previously led by Connington\'s close friend Toyne but now it is led by &quot;Homeless&quot; [[Harry Strickland]], a man skilled in negotiating lucrative contracts but cowardly facing combat, in the eyes of Connington.\n\nAfter presenting the young Griff as Prince Aegon Targaryen, son of the late Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]], to the highest-ranking members of the Company, the officers, including Connington, voice their lack of enthusiasm for the complicated situation. They did not anticipate that Daenerys would decide to remain in [[Meereen]] instead of marching out to meet her enemies and joining with them. Strickland reveals that the Golden Company has received a large number of alternative offers, including some which would involve them joining the coalition currently arrayed against [[Daenerys Targaryen]]. They also bemoan the constantly-changing plans of [[Illyrio Mopatis]] and Varys, who did not anticipate [[Viserys Targaryen]]\'s death  or that Daenerys would go to Slaver\'s Bay rather than [[Westeros]]. Seeing their disillusionment and an opportunity to claim the Iron Throne for his own, Prince Aegon offers them an alternative, earlier proposed by Tyrion: He does not wish to try to rally Daenerys and her dragons, but instead to sail to Westeros with the hope of obtaining support from [[Dorne]] in accordance with [[Doran Martell]]\'s own plan for avenging Princess [[Elia Martell]]. Aegeon reasons that once he and the Golden Company have begun the rebellion, Daenerys will cross the [[Narrow Sea]] to join him. This proposal is met with great enthusiasm from the officers, except Harry Strickland, who nevertheless has no choice but to comply.\n\nOnce agreed on the new plan, Aegon is taken on a tour of the mercenary camp. Connington retires to his quarters, satisfied with the new situation and impressed with a side of Aegon he has not previously seen. He hopes to return home to the castle of his ancestors and repay his debt to his old friend Rhaegar. It is then revealed that he is slowly succumbing to [[greyscale]] (presumably acquired during the attack by the Stone Men&lt;ref&gt;Between [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 18|Chapter 18 (Tyrion V)]] and [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 22|Chapter 22 (Tyrion VI)]]&lt;/ref&gt;), which is beginning to spread in his hand - he hopes that he will live several more years to see his ward sit the Iron Throne.\n\n==Character List==\n{{columns|7|\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Griff]]\n*[[Lemore]]\n*[[Yandry]]\n*[[Haldon]]\n*[[Young Griff]]\n*[[Franklyn Flowers]]\n*[[Marq Mandrake]]\n*[[Balaq]]\n*[[Gorys Edoryen]]\n*[[Lysono Maar]]\n*[[Harry Strickland]]\n*[[Watkyn]]\n*[[Laswell Peake]]\n*[[Tristan Rivers]]\n\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Rolly Duckfield]]\n*[[Malaquo]]\n*[[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n*[[Cersei Lannister]]\n*[[Myles Toyne]]\n*[[Rhaegar Targaryen]]\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n*[[Aerys II Targaryen]]\n*[[Rhaella Targaryen]]\n*[[Elia Martell]]\n*[[Rhaenys Targaryen (daughter of Rhaegar)|Rhaenys Targaryen]]\n*[[Illyrio Mopatis]]\n*[[Viserys Targaryen]]\n*Khal [[Drogo]]\n*[[Arthur Dayne]]\n*[[Varys]]\n*[[Maelys I Blackfyre]]\n*[[Terrence Toyne]]\n*[[Aegor Rivers]]\n*[[Daemon I Blackfyre]]\n*[[Bloodbeard]]\n*[[Tattered Prince]]\n*[[Aegon I Targaryen]]\n*[[Tywin Lannister]]\n*[[Tommen Baratheon]]\n*[[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n*[[Jaime Lannister]]\n*[[Margaery Tyrell]]\n*[[Mace Tyrell]]\n*[[Ysilla]]\n}}\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{columns|7|\n*[[Shy Maid]]\n*[[Volantis]]\n*[[Selhorys]]\n*[[Sorrows]]\n*[[Volon Therys]]\n*[[Golden Company]]\n*[[King\'s Landing]]\n*[[Iron Throne]]\n*[[Westeros]]\n*[[Stoney Sept]]\n*[[Battle of the Bells]]\n*[[Battle of the Trident]]\n*[[Seven Kingdoms]]\n*[[Pentos]]\n*[[Slaver\'s Bay]]\n*[[Faith of the Seven]]\n*[[Dothraki]]\n*[[Rhoyne]]\n*[[the Reach]]\n*[[Cider Hall]]\n*[[House Fossoway]]\n*[[Lys]]\n*[[House Strong]]\n*[[House Peake]]\n*[[House Mudd]]\n*[[House Mandrake]]\n*[[House Lothston]]\n*[[House Cole]]\n*[[Summer Islands]]\n*[[House Strickland]]\n*[[Blackfyre Rebellion]]\n*[[Dragonstone]]\n*[[First Men]]\n*[[Disputed Lands]]\n*[[Myr]]\n*[[Meereen]]\n*[[Yunkai]]\n*[[New Ghis]]\n*[[Tolos]]\n*[[Unsullied]]\n*[[Narrow Sea]]\n*[[Dorne]]\n*[[House Lannister]]\n*[[Casterly Rock]]\n*[[Highgarden]]\n*[[Griffin\'s Roost]]\n}}\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 24]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Jon Connington]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Volon Therys]]\n\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 24]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 25, Le seigneur perdu]]</text>\n      <sha1>jeswg8koazwr2uytj3oxi40qcvm7md4</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Dance with Dragons-Epilogue</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>7037</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>198394</id>\n      <parentid>187511</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2017-04-06T16:56:30Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Melanie</username>\n        <id>1443</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10470">{{Infobox Chapter ADwD\n| pov\t\t= [[Kevan Lannister]]\n| place         = [[King\'s Landing]]\n| title\t\t= Epilogue\n| page\t\t= 944\n| previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 71|Daenerys X]]\n| current\t= Epilogue\n| next\t\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Appendix|Appendix]]\n| arc previous\t= \n| arc next\t= \n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\nLord Regent [[Kevan Lannister]] is hosting a small council meeting in the [[Red Keep]]\'s throne room; neither Queen [[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]] nor [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] are present, nor is [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], as Kevan thinks it kinder to let him spend as much time as possible with his mother before her trial and possible execution. The lord of [[Griffin\'s Roost]], [[Ronnet Connington]] stands before them, insisting that he is loyal to King Tommen and uninvolved with whoever claims to be his uncle [[Jon Connington]] and the [[Targaryen]] pretender he has brought with him, who have landed with the [[Golden Company]] in the [[Stormlands]], attacking towns and villages as they march on [[Storm\'s End]].{{Ref|ADWD|61}} Ronnet begs to prove his loyalty in battle, but the new [[Hand of the King]] [[Mace Tyrell]] refuses, and orders Ronnet kept in his quarters for the moment, in addition to sending the men-at-arms [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] sent to accompany Connington south - all former [[Mountain\'s men|thugs]] of [[Gregor Clegane]]\'s - to the [[Night\'s Watch]]. \n\nKevan has begun to resent the demands of Mace Tyrell as Cersei did, but he realises he cannot openly oppose them; Tyrell and his bannerman [[Randyll Tarly]] have both brought armies to [[King\'s Landing]], while the Lannisters\' standing army is still in the [[Riverlands]]. Tyrell insists that he will deal with Connington and his boy after Margaery\'s trial, but both he and Tarly show much reluctance about it; Kevan however chides them. Tyrell then asks why Tommen can\'t declare Margaery\'s innocence without a trial, but Kevan insists that defying the Faith will send them straight into the arms of Connington or [[Stannis Baratheon]] at a time when the [[Ironborn]] are attacking the Western lands as well. Mace Tyrell retorts that [[Paxter Redwyne]] will drive the Ironmen back and that Stannis has to face both [[Roose Bolton]] and the cold climate of the North. He also dismisses the threat Jon Connington and the exiles of the [[Golden Company]] pose but Kevan is unsure; he still remembers when [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys]] appointed Connington to the role of Hand, and while [[Tywin Lannister]]\'s assessment of Connington as unsuitable for the post proved true after his failure to kill [[Robert Baratheon]] at the [[Battle of the Bells]], Kevan believes age has surely made Connington wiser, more cautious and more dangerous.\n\nThe small council all agree that Connington and his pretender must be crushed, lest [[Daenerys Targaryen]] receive word and leave [[Meereen]] to join forces with them. [[Pycelle]] suggests that they buy off the Golden Company, but new [[Master of Coin]] [[Harys Swyft]] dismisses this idea; thanks to Cersei\'s economic mismanagement, the treasury is nearly empty, the [[Iron Bank of Braavos]] still demanding its money, pledges for new loans from [[Myr]] received no favorable response, and their hopes of replenishing the treasuries with the fabled wealth on [[Dragonstone]] following [[Loras Tyrell|Ser Loras\'s]] capture of the island have proven in vain. Mace Tyrell reacts angrily to that, arguing that Loras searched the castle and found no trace of gold or gemstones, nor the fabled cache of [[dragon egg]]s supposedly kept there; Kevan personally thinks that Loras didn\'t look very hard, given that he is a young man prone to rash judgments, even more so following his injuries, and the [[Valyria]]n sorcery used to construct Dragonstone likely hides many secrets, but Kevan defuses the argument by suggesting Stannis likely took everything of value with him when he fled. Kevan also suggests that Harys try [[Pentos]]hi [[magister]] moneylenders, or else go to Braavos and deal with the Iron Bank in person. \n\nNext, business turns to the forthcoming trials; Kevan says that Cersei has chosen [[trial by battle]], with Ser [[Robert Strong]] to represent her as her champion. Tyrell and Tarly express deep misgivings about the man, which Kevan shares as they have all heard rumours: [[Meryn Trant]] says he has never seen Strong eat or drink, and [[Boros Blount]] claims to have never seen him use the privy. Kevan muses that \'\'&quot;Dead men don\'t shit&quot;\'\', suspecting that he and the others know [[Robert Strong/Theories|who Strong really is]]. However, Kevan silences Mace\'s protests by arguing that if Cersei loses her trial, the legitimacy of her children, and thus Margaery\'s claim to the throne as Tommen\'s queen will be called into question. He also assures the council that even if Cersei proves her innocence, she will be sent back to [[Casterly Rock]] afterwards, and play no further part in ruling or Tommen\'s education.\n\nThe meeting adjourns, intending to reconvene in five days\' time and leaving for later decisions about an inheritance involving [[House Rosby]] and six claims, as well as the preparation for [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]]\'s upcoming marriage. Mace Tyrell makes plain his scorn for the marriage, particularly after Myrcella\'s injuries, and suggests a better match for her; Kevan muses that Mace likely has his son [[Willas Tyrell|Willas]] in mind. He dismisses the idea, warning that reneging on Myrcella\'s betrothal now could be all the cause [[Doran Martell]] needs to side with Connington. Harys Swyft suggests that they get the Dornish to deal with Connington and his pretender; Kevan agrees that it would save them a lot of trouble. After Tyrell and Tarly are gone, Pycelle asks Kevan for guards, fearing that Mace Tyrell means to do him harm for his part in Cersei\'s claims about Margaery, but Kevan dismisses his concerns. \n[[File:SaraWintersVarys.jpg|[[Varys]], crossbow in hand. \xc2\xa9 FFG|thumb|300px|right]]\nIt is snowing heavily in King\'s Landing and Kevan retires to his study for a time to warm up. He muses on the possibility of raising his son [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]] to the Kingsguard to end his newfound piety, before his thoughts turn to Cersei, the charming and sweet girl once was; he believes that, had Aerys accepted Tywin\'s offer and wed his son to Cersei, [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]] would never have looked twice at [[Lyanna Stark]], and perhaps many now dead would still be alive. He then thinks on Cersei\'s [[walk of atonement|walk of shame]] and how similar it was to what Tywin did to their [[Tytos Lannister|father\'s]] [[Tytos Lannister\'s mistress|mistress]], but Kevan reassures himself it was necessary; the Faith had to be appeased, and left unchecked, Cersei would have corrupted Tommen as she did [[Joffrey]].\n\nKevan then goes to Cersei\'s chambers, where he has dinner with her and Tommen. Cersei is very calm and guarded after her walk of atonement, which Kevan thinks a good sign. She makes a humble request that [[Taena Merryweather]] attend on her once more after the trial and that her son be brought to court as a companion for Tommen; she also asks after her brothers, but Kevan has no news of Jaime or Tyrion. He also says that he has imprisoned the remaining Kettleblack brothers for their crimes of fornicating with a Queen; if they confess, he will send them to the Wall. If not, they will face Robert Strong.\n\nA messenger then announces that Grand Maester Pycelle is asking for Kevan\'s presence. Kevan arrives at the Maester\'s chambers and enters to find a [[white raven]] sitting on the window ledge, a sign from the [[Citadel]] that winter has come. Kevan turns to leave, and is hit in the chest by a crossbow bolt. He calls out for help, but then sees Pycelle sat at his table, already dead. For one moment, Kevan calls out to [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]], thinking his nephew responsible, but a familiar voice tells him otherwise as the real killer emerges: [[Varys]]. Varys explains to the dying Kevan that he bears the man no ill will, that Kevan is simply a good man in service to a bad cause, but he was becoming too successful in uniting the realm behind Tommen and undoing the damage Cersei had caused. The eunuch adds that Cersei will suspect the Tyrells (with help from the Imp) for Kevan\'s murder, the Tyrells will blame her, someone will blame the Dornish and the alliances shoring up Tommen\'s hold on the [[Iron Throne]] will crumble as [[Aegon VI Targaryen|Aegon]] makes his presence known at Storm\'s End and the realm flocks to the side of the Targaryens.\n\nKevan insists that Aegon was killed during the [[Sack of King\'s Landing]] but Varys explains otherwise; that Aegon has been groomed since birth to be king, taught not just in skill at arms and ruling, but how to look after himself, what it means to go hungry, to be hunted and most importantly, that it is his \'\'duty\'\' to rule, not his right, and to put his people first. Varys then summons some of his &quot;[[little birds]]&quot; and instructs them to finish the dying Kevan off.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n* [[Kevan Lannister]]\n* [[Tommen]]\n* [[Ronnet Connington]]\n* [[Cersei Lannister]]\n* [[Margaery Tyrell]]\n* [[Aerys II Targaryen]]\n* [[Mace Tyrell]]\n* [[Grand Maester Pycelle]]\n* [[Robert Baratheon]]\n* [[Randyll Tarly]]\n* [[Gregor Clegane]]\n* [[Jaime Lannister]]\n* [[Qyburn]]\n* [[Jon Connington]]\n* [[Aegon VI Targaryen]]\n* [[High Sparrow| High Septon]]\n* [[Rhaegar Targaryen]]\n* [[Owen Merryweather]]\n* [[Tywin Lannister]]\n* [[Qarlton Chelsted]]\n* [[Rossart]]\n* [[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n* [[Harys Swyft]]\n* [[Loras Tyrell]]\n* [[Robert Strong]]\n* [[Meryn Trant]]\n* [[Boros Blount]]\n* [[Myrcella Baratheon]]\n* [[Willas Tyrell]]\n* [[Doran Martell]]\n* [[Garth Tyrell]], Lord Seneschal of Highgarden\n* [[Paxter Redwyne]]\n* [[Euron Greyjoy]]\n* [[Nymeria Sand]]\n* [[Oberyn Martell]]\n* [[Littlefinger]]\n* [[Balon Swann]]\n* [[Darkstar]]\n* [[Osmund Kettleblack]]\n* [[Osfryd Kettleblack]]\n* [[Lyanna Stark]]\n* [[Elia Martell]]\n* [[Tytos Lannister]]\n* [[Taena Merryweather]]\n* [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n* [[Dorna Swyft]]\n* [[Osney Kettleblack]]\n* [[Varys]]\n}}\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 72]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV miscellaneous]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Ep\xc3\xadlogo]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 73, \xc3\x89pilogue]]</text>\n      <sha1>7zofaj9xfebrlx6ask2ln6xcky08qej</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 64</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6937</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>181526</id>\n      <parentid>166607</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-03-05T06:51:22Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Gonzalo</username>\n        <id>4306</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3321">{{Infobox Chapter ADwD\n| pov\t\t= [[Arya Stark]]\n| place         = [[Braavos]]\n| title\t\t= The Ugly Little Girl\n| page\t\t= 835\n| previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 63|Victarion I]]\n| current\t= The Ugly Little Girl\n| next\t\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 65|Cersei II]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 45|The Blind Girl]]\n| arc next\t= \n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\nAfter a gathering of eleven [[Faceless Men]], [[Arya Stark|Arya]] is interrogated by [[plague face]] and deemed ready for her first assassination. The [[kindly man]] informs Arya that she will need a new face for this job, since Cat of the Canals would be easily recognized. He and the [[waif]] lead her down into a hidden chamber deep under the [[House of Black and White]]. The walls are covered with mask-like faces, which Arya realizes are the faces of people who die at the House of Black and White. The face chosen for Arya is that of a young girl who was abused to the point of permanent disfigurement, and came to the House seeking death.\n\nArya\'s blood is used to soften the leathery mask into living skin, which then bonds to her head and becomes her new face. The kindly man warns Arya that she will suffer the nightmares of the girl whose face she has taken, but only for a time. His promise proves to be true, \nand that night Arya dreams of the abuse that was suffered by the girl at the hands of her father. The next day, Arya is given her first target. He is an elderly man running an insurance scam at a shipyard.\n\n[[File:Paul Guzenko Poisoned Coin.JPG|350px|thumb|left|Arya\'s target bites the poisoned coin. \xc2\xa9 Fantasy Flight Games]]\nThe target is always accompanied by two guards, and the kindly man has forbidden her to kill anyone other than her target, so Arya must stalk the man for several days to find an opportunity. She eventually dispatches him by slipping a poisoned coin into the purse of his client, knowing the man selling insurance will bite into the coin to test its legitimacy. The Kindly Man is pleased by her success, and raises her to the status of an acolyte. He gives her a black and white robe to wear while at the House and restores her face. However, the next day she is to take a new face and leave for her first apprenticeship with someone named [[Izembaro]].\n\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n* [[Arya Stark]]\n* [[Lordling]]\n* [[Fat fellow]]\n* [[Plague face]]\n* [[Handsome man]]\n* [[Squinter]]\n* [[Kindly man]]\n* [[Gregor Clegane]]\n* [[Dunsen]]\n* [[Raff]]\n* [[Ilyn Payne]]\n* [[Meryn Trant]]\n* [[Cersei Lannister]]\n* [[Brusco]]\n* [[Brea]]\n* [[Red Roggo]]\n* [[Waif]]\n* [[Jaqen H\'ghar]]\n* [[Tickler]]\n* [[Talea]]\n* [[Sailor\'s Wife]]\n* [[Tagganaro]]\n* [[Casso]]\n* [[Izembaro]]\n}}\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n* [[Braavos]]\n* [[House of Black and White]]\n* [[Winterfell]]\n* [[Purple Harbor]]\n* [[Harrenhal]]\n* [[Warren]]\n* [[Gardens of Gelenei]]\n* [[Stones of the Silent God]]\n* [[Patternmaker\'s Maze]]\n* [[Black Canal]]\n* [[Ragman\'s Harbor]]\n* [[Drowned Town]]\n* [[Happy Port]]\n* [[The Ship]]\n}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 64]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Arya Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Braavos]]\n\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 64]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 65, La laideronne]]</text>\n      <sha1>eoefmyw5z5szz9jssm0g73fvbiiq1le</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 62</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6247</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166391</id>\n      <parentid>122051</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-23T20:34:29Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4176">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Jaime Lannister]]\n| title\t\t= Jaime VII\n| place         = unnamed inn - [[King\'s Landing]]\n| page\t\t= 693\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 61|Sansa V]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 62|Jaime VII]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 63|Davos VI]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 44|Jaime VI]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 67|Jaime VIII]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\nAt an unnamed inn on the road to [[King\'s Landing]], [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] hears that the king is dead, [[Joffrey Baratheon|his firstborn son]], but he is more concerned about [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]]. Jaime and [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]] have already learned of [[Robb Stark]]\xe2\x80\x99s demise, and found out that Lord [[Clement Piper]] rode to King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing to bend the knee since his son [[Marq Piper|Marq]] is held captive at the [[Twins]]. When they arrive at the [[Red Keep]], Ser [[Loras Tyrell|Loras]] confronts Brienne, accusing her of killing [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]]. Jaime reminds the Knight of Flowers that he is his Lord Commander and orders him to sheathe his sword, but has Brienne arrested and taken to a tower cell.\n\nJaime finds Cersei in the castle [[sept]], where [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] is lying in state, and shows her his stump. She asks him to kill [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] for murdering Joffrey. Despite Cersei\xe2\x80\x99s words that Tyrion threatened her when she held [[Alayaya]] prisoner, Jaime tells her he wishes to learn more about what happened. He has sex with her on the Mother\'s altar, and afterwards Cersei calls it folly, saying that they must be more careful with their father in the castle. He responds that they should stop hiding their love and wed, even if [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] would lose the [[Iron Throne]], he would still be heir to [[Casterly Rock]], but she sends him away in anger.\n\nJaime then visits his father, and Lord [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] is furious when he learns that [[Vargo Hoat]] maimed his son. The [[Hand of the King]] reveals that the [[Bloody Mummers]] were routed at [[Harrenhal]], and that [[Gregor Clegane]] will kill the Goat soon but is using him for amusement in the meantime. Tywin then speaks of his plans to bribe the [[High Septon]] to release Jaime of his vows to the Kingsguard, find a new husband for Cersei, and perhaps marry Jaime to [[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]]. Jaime vehemently refuses to hear of it, stating that he is a knight of the [[Kingsguard]], and that\xe2\x80\x99s all he means to be. Lord Tywin turns from his son in disgust, saying, &quot;You are not my son. You say you are Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. Very well, ser.

However, he is shocked when he finds that the Dornishmen are being led by Prince [[Oberyn Martell]] and not his brother, Prince [[Doran Martell|Doran]]. The Red Viper of Dorne has an infamous reputation for using poisoned weapons in battle. The man fought in the [[Free Cities]] and even formed his own [[sellsword]] company, he studied at the [[Citadel]] for a time, and most importantly, he crippled [[Willas Tyrell]] in a tourney. Though this was years ago, it has never been forgotten by the [[House Tyrell|Tyrells]], who will not be happy that this man is attending the marriage of one of them. \n\nThe Red Viper tells Tyrion the story of how he and [[Elia Martell|Elia]] traveled to [[Casterly Rock]] when Tyrion was an infant. It was just after the death of [[Joanna Lannister]]. [[Tywin Lannister]] was in mourning and ignored the Martells. Oberyn and Elia were disappointed to find out that Tyrion was only a dwarf, after the stories they had heard about him being Tywin\xe2\x80\x99s monster son. The Red Viper then gets down to the point, asking Tyrion, &quot;when will justice be served?&quot; He warns Tyrion that he does not mean to stop after killing [[Gregor Clegane]]: &quot;Before he dies, the Enormity that Rides will tell me whence came his orders, please assure your lord father of that.&quot; But Tyrion has a more subtle warning: The [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] have tens of thousands of Tyrell men present as allies. And the Tyrells hate the Dornish, and especially Prince Oberyn for what he did to Willas.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Oberyn Martell]] The Red Viper\n*[[Doran Martell]]\n*[[Willas Tyrell]]\n*[[Elia Martell]]\n*[[Joanna Lannister]]\n*[[Tywin Lannister]]\n*[[Gregor Clegane]]\n*[[Flement Brax]].\n*[[Merlon Crakehall]]\n*[[Leo Tyrell (Longthorn)]]\n}}\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Dorne|Dornishmen]]\n*[[Free Cities]]\n*[[Sellsword]]\n*[[Citadel]]\n*[[House Tyrell]]\n*[[Casterly Rock]]\n*[[House Lannister]]\n}}\n\n\n==References and Notes==\n* The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/03/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-21 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Part 21].

Tyrion goes to tell [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] the news, wanting very much to see her reaction. She tells him she could have frightened Bran into silence, but [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] reacted without thinking. Tyrion tells her that they must take good care of [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]], because with two of her sons dead, Lady [[Catelyn Tully|Catelyn]] might decide to kill Jaime. Cersei warns him that he trusts Varys too much, telling him that the Spider feeds them all information to make them think they would be helpless without him. She reveals that Varys told her Tyrion meant to take [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]] from [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], and Tyrion explains he needs Sandor Clegane and Ser [[Balon Swann]] to lead sorties in the upcoming battle. Tyrion also informs her he means to give Joffrey a small command far out of the main fighting, so that the men can see their King leading them. \n\nCersei then springs a surprise on Tyrion, bringing out who she thinks is Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s whore, [[Alayaya]]. The girl has been badly beaten, and the Queen reveals she did this because [[House Lannister|a Lannister]] always pays her debts, and Tyrion has been conspiring against her since he arrived. Tyrion pretends to be horrified, but is relieved that his sister had not found [[Shae]]. Cersei tells him the whore will not be harmed so long as [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] remains safe, but Tyrion bluffs by saying he will have Tommen treated the same way the girl is. Alayaya does not give Tyrion away, and goes along with the whole thing. Tyrion then threatens to pay Cersei back for what she did, when she least expects it. Having lost, the Queen shouts at him to get out. He finds Shae in his room, having come through the secret passage, but she was blindfolded by Varys and does not know where the entrance lies. \n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/07/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-26 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n*The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n\n[[Category:A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 54]]\n[[Category:A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Tyrion Lannister]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 54]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 55, Tyrion]]</text>\n      <sha1>koabzyon0ai0c606k2gz85xktwg8scd</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Feast for Crows-Chapter 21</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5676</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>142439</id>\n      <parentid>116714</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2014-09-22T20:13:43Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Scafloc</username>\n        <id>28</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4247">{{Infobox Chapter AFfC\n| pov\t\t= [[Arianne Martell]]\n| title\t\t= The Queenmaker\n| place         = [[Shandystone]] - the [[Greenblood]]\n| page\t\t= 298\n| previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 20|Brienne IV]]\n| current\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 21|The Queenmaker]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 22|Arya II]]\n| arc previous\t= \n| arc next\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 40|The Princess in the Tower]]\n}}\n[[File:Paco Rico Torres Arianne\'s Conspirators.JPG|Arianne with her conspirators. \xc2\xa9 FFG|thumb|350px|right]]\n==Synopsis==\nAt a hidden well at [[Shandystone]] in the desert of [[Dorne]], [[Arianne Martell|Arianne]] and her most trusted companions are awaiting the arrival of [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]] and her sworn sword. Although Arianne has the utmost trust in [[Garin (Orphans)|Garin]], [[Andrey Dalt|Drey]] and [[Sylva Santagar|Sylva]], she is still unsure about [[Gerold Dayne]] the Darkstar. She considers his cruel nature and the mystery surrounding him. She is worried that [[Arys Oakheart|Arys]] may be wary of him. But if this would happen and they would to come to blows, who would win? Garin warns Arianne that he does not like the man, but she reminds him that they may need his sword and eventually [[High Hermitage|his castle]]. Later, Darkstar tells her that this scheme to crown Myrcella will not work as she has planned. He then unsheathes his sword, and reveals that you incite a war with steel (meaning they should kill Myrcella).\n\nWhen Arys and Princess Myrcella arrive, Arianne introduces the girl to her companions. Myrcella recalls the great knight [[Arthur Dayne]] when she meets Darkstar, which seems to upset the Knight of [[High Hermitage]], because in his mind people always remember his cousin for his famous sword. Arys draws Arianne off alone and reveals that [[Tywin Lannister]] is dead. \n\nThey set off at night for the [[Greenblood]], where they will take an orphan\'s barge west along the river. Myrcella is confused, having been told nothing by Arys, especially the fact that everyone keeps calling her &quot;your Grace&quot;. Arianne tells her some of their plan, that they intend to crown her Queen, because her brother [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] was being controlled by evil councillors. During the trip, Myrcella asks Garin why they call him &quot;an orphan of the Greenblood&quot; when he has a mother and father. He explains that it is a metaphor for their mourning the loss of their homeland, and the &quot;mother&quot; river the [[Rhoyne]]. They built barges along the Greenblood and hammered them together, as they did in their ancestral land, for they were never comfortable in the deserts of Dorne. \n\nAs Arianne is considering her plan to crown Myrcella at [[Hellholt]], where [[Ellaria Sand]]\'s father [[Harmen Uller]] rules, they reach the river and spot the barge that Garin\'s people promised would be waiting. But as they get closer, [[Areo Hotah]] steps from the cabin with a dozen crossbowmen. Arianne yells for them to flee, while Drey recommends they yield. But Arys Oakheart charges  the boat, intent on protecting his two princesses at all costs. Hit with several bolts, he reaches the deck but falls to Captain Hotah\'s longaxe.  As Arianne falls off her horse screaming &quot;No!&quot;, she hears Myrcella shrieking, and Hotah commanding horsemen to chase after Darkstar, who fled. Arianne notices Myrcella on her hands and knees, her head in her hands and blood streaming down her arms. Then she is brought before Hotah, pleading to know how her father discovered what she planned. The Captain of the Guards responds, &quot;Someone told. Someone always tells.&quot;\n\n==References and Notes==\n*The synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/05/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-feast-for-crows-part-15 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Feast for Crows, Part 15].

[[Maester]] [[Luwin]] takes Bran down to the crypts to show him his father is not there. They find Rickon already there. They go back to the maester\xe2\x80\x99s turret where Luwin tells them about the coming of the [[First Men]], the treaty with the [[children of the forest]] and the coming of the [[Andals]]. A raven arrives with news of Lord Eddard\xe2\x80\x99s death.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Bran Stark|Bran]] is watching Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]] train the new young recruits in the yard of [[Winterfell]]. [[Maester]] [[Luwin]] is taking measurements of the comet through his lens tube. Bran comments that the recruits do not fight very well, and is told that Lord [[Eddard Stark|Eddard]] took the cream of the guard with him to [[King\'s Landing]] and then [[Robb Stark|Robb]] took the rest along with all the likely men for leagues around; men are needed to walk the walls of [[Winterfell]]. Bran stares resentfully at the boys below, remembering how he knocked Prince [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] down many times. Then Bran suggests that he could fight from [[Hodor]]\xe2\x80\x99s back, but Luwin dismisses the idea as impractical. Bran talks about the blind knight [[Symeon Star-Eyes]], but Luwin insists that that is only a story and that Bran must put his dreams aside.\n\nThe mention of dreams reminds Bran of his new dream of the [[three-eyed crow]], a dream that was very sad. He tells Luwin how the crow brought him down to the crypts and his father was there. His father was sad because of [[Jon Snow|Jon]]. When he woke up, Bran wanted to go down to the crypts to see if his father was there, but [[Hodor]] would not take him. Luwin tells Bran that Eddard will be down there someday, but not be for many years. Bran insists the dream was real and that his father was there. In order to dispel the boy\xe2\x80\x99s delusion, Maester Luwin calls for [[Osha]], who tells them that she has lived [[beyond the Wall]], so a hole in the ground will not scare her. Because of Osha\xe2\x80\x99s good behavior, her chains have been removed, but the shackles remain to show she is not totally trusted. She carries Bran in her arms, but he does not mind.\n\n[[File:Thaldir Shaggydog.jpg|When Maester [[Luwin]] sticks his arm into the future tomb of Lord [[Eddard Stark]] [[Shaggydog]] springs out and savages his arm. - art by Tiziano Baracchi. \xc2\xa9 Fantasy Flight Games|thumb|right|350px]]\n\nThe vault seems very dark and gloomy. Summer and Osha seem uncomfortable. When Bran states that the men represented by the granite statues were the [[King in the North|Kings of Winter]], Osha tells him that winter has no king; if he had seen a winter he would know. They proceed down the long corridor, past the statues, but Summer refuses to leave the steps. Bran tells the accomplishments of the different lords and kings: [[Jon Stark]], [[Rickard Stark (king)|Rickard Stark]], [[Theon Stark]], [[Brandon Stark (Shipwright)|Brandon the Shipwright]], [[Brandon Stark (Burner)|Brandon the Burner]], [[Rodrik Stark]], [[Torrhen Stark]], and [[Cregan Stark]]. When they get to the end with the statues of [[Brandon Stark]], [[Lyanna Stark]] and Lord [[Rickard Stark]], Luwin sticks his arm into the future tomb of Eddard, and [[Shaggydog]] springs out and savages Maester Luwin\'s arm. \n\nBran calls for Summer, who slams into Shaggydog, knocking the wolf off Luwin. Osha goes to assist Luwin. As the wolves fight, Rickon appears at the mouth of Eddard\xe2\x80\x99s tomb, telling Luwin to leave his father be. When Bran tells Rickon father is not there, Rickon states that he saw him last night, and that he is coming home. Luwin, now looking unsure, tells Rickon that Shaggydog was supposed to be chained. Rickon replies that he does not like to be chained, and Luwin states that he is now the third man Shaggydog has savaged and it will only be a matter of time before he kills someone. Bran calmly states they will wait in Maester Luwin\'s tower, which Luwin states is quite impossible. Osha replies that Bran is the lord. Rickon agrees to come if Shaggy comes too. Maester Luwin reluctantly follows.\n\nThey enter Maester Luwin\'s cluttered turret, where Osha bandaged the maester\'s wound, following his instructions. Luwin tries to explain to the boys about the logic of them both dreaming the same dream. He says that Rickon is too young to understand, to which Rickon states that he is four. Then he tells Bran that he is old enough to know that dreams are just dreams. Osha adds in that some dreams are just dreams and some are not; the [[children of the forest]] could teach him something about dreams. \n\nBran starts to go into the stories that [[Old Nan]] told about the children of the forest: they knew the songs of the trees, flew like birds, swam like fish, talked to animals, and made beautiful music. The maester says that a man who trusts in spells duels with a glass sword. Luwin takes out several arrowheads made of [[dragonglass]], or [[obsidian]], which the children of the forest forged. He tells them that the children used shirts of woven leaves and greaves of bark in place of armor and carried blades of obsidian; Osha comments that they still do. Bran and Rickon each take some arrowheads. \n\n\'The children lived during the [[Dawn Age]], before the coming of men in the land now called the [[Seven Kingdoms]]. They lived in the depths of the woods, in caves and crannogs and secret tree towns. Their wise men were called [[greenseer]]s and carved the faces in the [[weirwood]]s to watch over the forest. No one knows how long they reigned or where they came from.\' Twelve thousand years ago, the [[First Men]] crossed the [[Broken Arm]] of [[Dorne]] before it was broken. The First Men were mounted, tall of stature, and wielded bronze weapons.\n\nThe First Men chopped down the weirwood trees to build holdfasts, and the enraged children of the forest started a war. The [[greensight|greenseers]] supposedly used dark magic to make the sea rise and break the landmass that is now the broken arm of [[Dorne]]. Finally, a truce was called and the leaders of both races met on the [[Isle of Faces]] in the [[Gods Eye]]. After the [[Pact]] was forged, the greenmen formed to keep watch over the Isle of Faces and the First Men eventually adopted the [[old gods]] worshiped by the children. The signing of the Pact ended the Dawn Age and began the [[Age of Heroes]]. The Pact started 4000 years of friendship between the children and the First Men. While the kingdoms of the First Men endured, so did the Pact, all through the Age of Heroes, the [[Long Night]], and the birth of the Seven Kingdoms. \n\nEventually the [[Andal]] invaders came with steel, fire, and the seven-pointed star of the [[Faith of the Seven|new gods]]. The war lasted for hundreds of years, and the Andals burned most of the weirwoods remaining in the south, slaughtering the children where they found them. The children fled north. During the story, Osha adds that there are still children north of the [[Wall]], and also giants, and other old races; Maester Luwin is not happy with Osha filling the two boys with folly.\n\nLuwin\xe2\x80\x99s tale is cut off when the two [[direwolf|direwolves]] start howling. Now Bran is sure that he knew it. The direwolves quiet and a bloodied messenger raven appears. Even Maester Luwin is not sure he wants to know what is in the message. Bran, hugging Rickon hard, asks about the message and Osha tells him he knows, while putting a hand gently on his head. Maester Luwin reads the message and tears up as he tells them that they will need to find a stone carver that knew their father\xe2\x80\x99s likeness well.\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Bran Stark]]\n*[[Rodrik Cassel]]\n*[[Summer]]\n*[[Luwin]]\n*[[Osha]]\n*[[Shaggydog]]\n*[[Rickon Stark]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Tommen Baratheon]]\n*[[Hodor]]\n*[[Nan|Old Nan]]\n*[[Symeon Star-Eyes]]\n*[[Florian the Fool]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Jon Snow]]\n*[[Rickard Stark]]\n*[[Edwyle Stark]]\n*[[Cersei Lannister]]\n*[[Dancer (horse)|Dancer]]\n*[[Jon Stark]]\n*[[Rickard Stark (king)|King Rickard Stark]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Theon Stark]]\n*[[Brandon Stark (Shipwright)|Brandon the Shipwright]]\n*[[Brandon Stark (Burner)|Brandon the Burner]]\n*[[Rodrik Stark]]\n*[[Torrhen Stark]]\n*[[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]]\n*[[Cregan Stark]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Aemon Targaryen|Aemon the Dragonknight]]\n*[[Aerys II Targaryen|Mad King Aerys]]\n*[[Lyanna Stark]]\n*[[Brandon Stark]]\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n*[[Rhaegar Targaryen]]\n|}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/11/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-32 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2009/08/arya-bran.html Humorous review of the chapter]\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/067/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 66]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Bran Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Winterfell]]\n\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 67, Bran]][[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\x91\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0\xd0\xbd VII]]</text>\n      <sha1>qrhulwdndxemn5hvyenc2owazq4va0p</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 75</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6255</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>163594</id>\n      <parentid>122065</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-04-01T16:53:06Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Nittanian</username>\n        <id>3504</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3913">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Samwell Tarly|Samwell]]\n| title\t\t= Samwell IV\n| place         = [[Castle Black]]\n| page\t\t= 855\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 74|Arya XIII]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 75|Samwell IV]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 76|Jon XI]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 46|Samwell III]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 78|Samwell V]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\nAt [[Castle Black]], [[Gilly]] is nursing both her own son as well as [[Mance Rayder]]\xe2\x80\x99s, as [[Dalla]] died giving birth. [[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] and Gilly have recently returned to Castle Black, meeting up with Ser [[Denys Mallister]] and the men from the [[Shadow Tower]]. They also joined with [[Dywen]], [[Edd Tollett|Edd]] and [[Bedwyck|Giant]], survivors from the Bridge of Skulls where [[Bowen Marsh]] held back the [[Weeper]]\'s advance. Sam is happy to be reunited with [[Jon Snow|Jon]], although he is wary of King [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]\'s army being present at Castle Black. It was the king who defeated the [[wildlings]], scattering their remnants back into the [[haunted forest]]. [[Val]] wants to bring her sister\xe2\x80\x99s baby to Mance, but Jon tells her that only Maester [[Aemon Targaryen (son of Maekar I)|Aemon]] is permitted to see the imprisoned wildling king. Alone, Sam asks Jon, &quot;Could there be honor in a lie, if it were told for a good purpose?&quot; Sam is considering sending Gilly and her son to [[Horn Hill]], with a letter claiming that he  fathered the boy.\n\nJon reveals that [[Janos Slynt|Slynt]] still considers him a traitor, because he did not kill Mance as he was sent to do. Sam remembers swearing to [[Bran Stark|Bran]] and [[Jojen Reed]] not to reveal to anyone, even Jon, that Bran is still alive. [[Coldhands]]\xe2\x80\x99 last words to Sam were, &quot;Let the world believe the boy is dead. We want no seekers coming after us. Swear it, Samwell of the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch. Swear it for the life you owe me.&quot; And Sam has kept his vows to all three. Later, Sam considers the last vote for a new Lord Commander, with Ser Denys Mallister still leading, but no one near the majority. At dinner, Bowen Marsh withdraws his name from the voting, and backs Janos Slynt. When the votes are tallied that night, both Ser Denys and [[Cotter Pyke]] have lost votes, and Slynt has gained on both of them. Sitting with [[Grenn]], [[Pypar|Pyp]] and Dolorous Edd, Pyp suggests that if Sam were to persuade either Ser Denys or Cotter Pyke to set aside their quarrels and back the other, a new Lord Commander could be decided. Preferably one who would be beneficial to the Watch, so long as it was not Janos Slynt.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Gilly]]\n*[[Mance Rayder]]\n*[[Dalla]]\n*[[Samwell Tarly]]\n*[[Denys Mallister]]\n*[[Dywen]]\n*[[Edd Tollett]]\n*[[Bedwyck]] (Giant)\n*[[Bowen Marsh]]\n*[[Weeper]]\n*[[Jon Snow]]\n*[[Stannis Baratheon]]\n*[[Val]]\n*[[Aemon Targaryen (son of Maekar I)|Aemon]]\n*[[Janos Slynt]]\n*[[Bran Stark]]\n*[[Jojen Reed]]\n*[[Coldhands]]\n*[[Cotter Pyke]]\n*[[Grenn]]\n*[[Pypar]] (Pyp)\n}}\t\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Castle Black]]\n*[[Shadow Tower]]\n*[[Wildlings]]\n*[[Haunted forest]]\n*[[Horn Hill]]\n}}\n\n\n==References and Notes==\n* The synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/10/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-49 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Part 49].

[[Robb Stark|Robb]] goes ahead to find the [[direwolf|direwolves]] and Bran is attacked by six outlaws. Robb returns with the direwolves and defeats all but one. The last man holds a dagger to Bran\xe2\x80\x99s throat until [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] kills him with an arrow from behind. [[Osha]], the only survivor, is taken captive.\n\n==Synopsis==    \n[[Bran Stark|Bran]] is finally getting to ride outside of the castle in the oversize saddle that [[Tyrion Lannister]] designed for him. He has been riding a horse he named [[Dancer (horse)|Dancer]] in the yard for the past fortnight, getting bolder each time. With his legs unable to grip, the swaying motion of the horse makes him unsteady at first, but the straps around his chest and thighs prevent him from falling. Soon Bran gets into the rhythm and his anxiety fades into a tremulous smile.\n\nBran would have preferred to have gone out with just [[Robb Stark|Robb]], but neither [[Maester]] [[Luwin]] nor the new Captain of Guard, [[Hallis Mollen]], would allow it. The party includes Robb, [[Joseth]] the Master of Horse, [[Theon Greyjoy]], Maester Luwin, and the [[direwolf|direwolves]] [[Summer]] and [[Grey Wind]]. As they pass through the village, Theon calls out to two serving wenches by the ale house. [[Kyra|One]] blushes and Theon declares to Robb that she squirms like a weasel in bed but blushes if you say anything to her in the street. Before Theon can continue his ribald story, Robb insists he not talk about such things around Bran. Bran notes that Robb seems to admire Theon, but Bran has never warmed to him. \n\nBran asks to go faster, and Robb agrees and spurs his own horse. Bran brings Dancer to a gallop, and catches up to Robb at the edge of the [[wolfswood]]. Bran exclaims his excitement at being able to ride, and Robb smiles, but Bran can tell something is bothering his brother. Robb notes that something is bothering the direwolves as well before admitting there was a raven the night before. The news recently from the ravens has not been good: [[Benjen Stark|Uncle Benjen]] has still not been found and [[Catelyn Tully|their mother]] has taken [[Tyrion Lannister]] captive. Bran remembers Robb sending riders with commands throughout the north. Nobody had told him what was happening, but Bran knew it was about the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] and not good. There is something about the Lannisters that Bran knows he ought to remember, but when he tries to think what it is he becomes dizzy and his stomach clenches. \n\nRobb explains that the message was from [[Alyn]] in [[King\'s Landing]]. [[Heward]], [[Wyl (guard)|Wyl]], and [[Jory Cassel]] have been [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 35|murdered]] by the [[Jaime Lannister|Kingslayer]]. Bran cannot understand why anyone would kill Jory, whom he remembers chasing him across the roofs of [[Winterfell]]. Robb continues solemnly that their [[Eddard Stark|father]]\xe2\x80\x99s leg was shattered in the fight and he has not woken since. Robb promises Bran that he \xe2\x80\x9cwill not let this be forgotten.\xe2\x80\x9d Theon advises Robb to call the banners. Bran exclaims that only the Lord can call the banners, but Theon replies that if Eddard dies, Robb is Lord of Winterfell. Robb notes to Bran that the honor of [[the North]] is in his hands. Bran asks if Maester Luwin agrees with calling the banners, and Theon calls the maester as timid as an old woman. Bran tells Robb that their father and mother both listen to the maester\xe2\x80\x99s council; Robb states that he listens to everyone.\n\nThe joy of the ride is over and Bran asks if they can go back because he is cold. Robb states that first they need to find the wolves and the brothers ride into the wolfswood while Theon falls back to talk with a guardsman. Bran enjoys riding his horse in the woods while Theon and the guardsmen fall further behind. When they come to a stream, Robb asks Bran what is troubling him. Bran admits that he remembers Jory bringing them here to fish with [[Jon Snow]]. Bran asks if they will ever see Jon again and Robb reminds him that even Uncle [[Benjen]] came to visit. Then the wolves howl and Robb rides off to get them, asking Bran to stay there.\n\n[[File:Osha.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Osha the Wildling \xe2\x80\x94 by Amok \xc2\xa9]]\n\nBran is getting anxious about the others when four ragged men and two women surround him. Bran can tell they are neither foresters nor farmers and suddenly he remembers how richly he is dressed. The biggest man asks if he is lost and Bran says that his guard will be along shortly. Bran, seeing their clothes, believes that the rags could be the black of the [[Night\'s Watch]]; he remembers that his father said deserters are dangerous because they know their life is forfeit. \n\nThe outlaws demand his silver pin and his horse. When Bran tries to explain that he cannot dismount, they do not believe him. The big man, whom the others call [[Stiv]], grabs the reins before Bran thinks of turning and riding off. Finally, the tall woman, [[Osha]], sees the straps. The short woman named [[Hali]] asks if he is a cripple. Angered, Bran declares that he is Brandon Stark and that they had better let go of his horse or they will be dead. With Bran\xe2\x80\x99s arrogant outburst, the gaunt man named [[Wallen]] proclaims that only a Stark would threaten when a smarter man would beg. Hali tells the others to cut off his cock and stuff it in his mouth. Osha tells Hali that she is as stupid as she is ugly; [[Mance Rayder]] will pay well for a kinsman of [[Benjen Stark]]. Stiv states that he does not want to go back to the [[Others|White Walkers]], and cuts the strap on Bran\xe2\x80\x99s saddle, cutting Bran\xe2\x80\x99s leg in the process. Bran feels nothing, but starts to feel light headed.\n\nSuddenly Robb calls out for them to surrender. Bran sees that Robb is still mounted, with the body of an elk over the back of his horse. The outlaws only laugh and point out that it is Robb who is outnumbered and should surrender. Then the direwolves appear at Robb\xe2\x80\x99s whistle. Robb charges, killing one of the men and riding down Osha when she overextends with her spear. At the same time [[Grey Wind]] kills Wallen and the other unnamed man while Summer tears open Hali\xe2\x80\x99s belly. \n\n[[File:Brittmartin Theon.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Theon Greyjoy and his bow\xe2\x80\x94 by BrittMartin \xc2\xa9 Green Ronin Publishing.]]\n\nNow facing Robb and the direwolves alone, Stiv finishes cutting Bran free, hauls him from the saddle, and holds his knife to Bran\xe2\x80\x99s throat. Stiv tells Robb to drop his sword and Robb slowly complies. Then Stiv tells Robb to call the direwolves off, which Robb does. Bran can see that Osha is still alive. Stiv commands Osha to kill the wolves, but she refuses to go anywhere near them. Instead, Stiv orders Robb to kill the wolves. Bran screams \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d knowing that they will be defenseless without the wolves. Suddenly an arrow from Theon Greyjoy\xe2\x80\x99s bow bursts through Stiv\xe2\x80\x99s chest and the man collapses into the stream.\n\nThe Stark guardsmen appear and Osha throws down her spear and surrenders. The guardsmen grow pale and some even vomit when they see the carnage. Theon, ever smiling, is proud of his shot, but Robb scolds him for taking such a chance with Bran\xe2\x80\x99s life; he might have missed or the knife could have slipped. Then Robb turns on the guardsmen, asking where they were. They explain that at first they were waiting for Maester Luwin and Theon admits he lead them off to hunt a turkey. Robb is angrier than Bran has ever seen him. \n\nAs Maester Luwin examines Bran\xe2\x80\x99s wounds he points out to Robb that two of the attackers wear the black of the Night\'s Watch. Robb orders their heads cut off for transport back to [[the Wall]], but orders the bodies left unburied. The question of what to do with Osha comes up. The woman drops to her knees to beg Robb to spare her, proclaiming that she will serve him. When Robb asks what use he might have for an oath-breaker, Osha insists that, as a [[wildling]], she broke no oaths. Theon suggests that they give her to the wolves, which causes Osha to shudder and even some guardsmen to look queasy. Maester Luwin advises that they question her, so Robb orders her bound and brought back to Winterfell.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/08/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-19 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/038/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==    \n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 37]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Bran Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in the North]]\n\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 38, Bran]][[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\x91\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0\xd0\xbd V]]</text>\n      <sha1>6ey0lo80bsp4rbtx7qh5jfphcvjy0j4</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 56</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6904</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>197168</id>\n      <parentid>166634</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2017-01-30T15:38:25Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2501">{{Infobox Chapter ADwD\n| pov\t\t= [[Victarion Greyjoy]]\n| place         = [[Isle of Cedars]]\n| title\t\t= The Iron Suitor\n| page\t\t= 741\n| previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 55|The Queensguard]]\n| current\t= The Iron Suitor\n| next\t\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 57|Tyrion XI]]\n| arc previous\t= \n| arc next\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 63|Victarion I]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:Lukasz Jaskolski VictarionGreyjoyhandII.png|Moqorro apparently uses magic on the lord captain; when Victarion emerges from his cabin, his hand is charred and blackened. \xc2\xa9 FFG|thumb|350px|left]]\n[[Victarion Greyjoy]] is anchored near the [[Isle of Cedars]], right outside [[Slaver\'s Bay]], to find [[Daenerys Targaryen]].

Angered by [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]]\'s brazen demand to sit on the [[Iron Throne]] and at council, she realizes that [[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]] put him up to this. Cersei refuses to give her power up to anyone, at least until Tommen comes of age. \n\nNext, she sends away the [[Iron Bank of Braavos|Iron Bank]]\'s envoy [[Noho Dimittis]] after telling him there will be no payment until the rebellion is ended. She receives word from [[Pycelle]] that Lord [[Wyman Manderly|Manderly]] had Ser [[Davos Seaworth|Davos]] beheaded, and the [[House Frey|Freys]] confirmed this. Later, she speaks with [[Osmund Kettleblack]] about his [[Osney Kettleblack|younger brother]]\'s failed efforts to bed Margaery. Osmund swears that the young queen likes him, but that they are never alone. The [[Kingsguard]] names some of those always around her, including the male singers she prefers to entertain her and her companions.\n\nWhen Cersei crosses the yard and finds Tommen riding at the quintain, she is infuriated. Once again, this was Margaery\'s idea, and while all those gathered are cheering the young king\'s jousting ability, Cersei blunders by saying, &quot;One day you shall rule the lists, as your father did.&quot; Margaery astutely catches this and asks what tourneys [[Robert Baratheon|King Robert]] had won. The Queen Regent evades this by mentioning Robert\'s deeds at the Trident. She then berates [[Loras Tyrell|Loras]] for teaching Tommen how to ride, but the Kingsguard reminds her that there has been no master-at-arms at the [[Red Keep]] since [[Aron Santagar]] was killed. Walking back to her solar, she considers sending for another Dornish master-at-arms, just to irk the [[House Tyrell|Tyrells]].\n\nIn her solar, [[Qyburn]] informs her that Prince [[Doran Martell|Doran]] has imprisoned [[Daemon Sand]] for demanding the release of the [[Sand Snakes]], and that [[Sylva Santagar]] has been hastily married to the elderly [[Eldon Estermont]]. He also tells her that both Daemon Sand and Sylva are close friends of Doran\'s daughter [[Arianne Martell|Arianne]]. Cersei could not care less, but she is interested to hear of a treasonous puppet show. She commands Qyburn to have the four puppeteers put to death, but Qyburn wants the women for his &quot;experiments&quot;. Cersei has already given him [[Senelle]], but he tells her she didn\'t last. The Queen Regent recalls her screaming in the darkness when she was down in the [[black cells]], but grants Qyburn his test subjects. Later, as she is bathing in preparation for dinner, [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] arrives with Tommen, who is demanding to see her. The boy king wants his horse tomorrow so that Loras can continue training him, but his mother will have none of it. Jaime mocks her for suggesting that Ser Osmund is thrice the knight Ser Loras is, but Cersei finally convinces her son to wait for a new master-at-arms to be named.\n\nAs she gets dressed, Cersei recalls her fit of rage when her washerwoman shrunk several of her gowns; but it is obvious she is unaware that she is actually gaining weight from all the alcohol. Her guests for dinner are [[Falyse Stokeworth]] and her husband, [[Balman Byrch]]. It is revealed that [[Tanda Stokeworth]] has been thrown from her horse and fractured her hip, but Cersei thinks to herself that Tanda will not recover from the wound at her age. Falyse says she was refused hospitality by the [[ward of Lord Gyles Rosby]] and that she encountered [[sparrows|ruffians]] on the road. Cersei deftly convinces Falyse and Balman that she fears [[Bronn]] is either hiding Tyrion or gathering swords for him, and may mean to try and kill Tommen. They assure her that it was solely Bronn\'s responsibility for naming [[Lollys Stokeworth|Lollys\'s]] bastard son &quot;[[Tyrion Tanner|Tyrion]]&quot;, but Balman gets the hint that Cersei would like to see the ex-sellsword disposed of, and tells her not to worry any further.                                                                    \n\nOn her way to bed, Cersei peeks in on Tommen and sees three kittens in bed with him. [[Meryn Trant]] informs her that Margaery gave them to him. That night, Cersei thinks of Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]], and how King [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys]] blocked their betrothal out of spite. When she was 10, her father and her aunt [[Genna Lannister|Genna]] promised she would be betrothed to Rhaegar after the [[tourney for King Aerys II]] in [[Lannisport]]. She was so happy that she agreed to visit the witch [[Maggy]] the Frog with her friends. They laughed at her prophesies, but that night King Aerys mocked Lord Tywin for thinking he would give his son\'s hand to his servant Tywin\'s daughter. And after that, Maggy\'s predictions started to come true, one after another.\n\n==References and Notes==\n*The synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/06/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-feast-for-crows-part-17 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Feast for Crows, Part 17].

He sees that the city defenders have few enough ships, but the shore is well fortified, and dozens of catapults and archers line the walls of the city. Davos is glad to know that Stannis sent [[Melisandre]] back to [[Dragonstone]], because the king feared the commonfolk would say it was the sorceress who won the battle. \n\nAs they pass two winch towers on either side of the headwaters of the channel entering the [[Blackwater Rush]], Davos fears a chain boom, which he sees exists, but it is not raised. The old sailor is curious, but there is little time to consider what it means. Fighting breaks out, and despite his inexperience, Ser Imry\xe2\x80\x99s battle plans seem to be working well, until the barge with the [[wildfire]] in it explodes. The channel turns into a ruin of hundreds of ships, many burning from the unquenchable green liquid. Davos goes overboard as hundreds of men on both sides die screaming in the green blaze. As the mass of ships and debris begin to float back out towards the bay and Davos hopes he can reach the open sea, he sees the great chain boom raised closing off the Blackwater Rush, turning its mouth into the mouth of hell.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n* [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2012/01/re-read-davos-iii-no-time-for-sea.html Analyses and summary of the chapter] in the course of a 10th reread by Slynt.\n* [http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/07/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-28 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n* The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 58]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Davos Seaworth]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place on the Blackwater Bay]]\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 58]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 59, Davos]]</text>\n      <sha1>1wofrlzayfy4b3uk5gstg6nj4fie7u0</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Game of Thrones-Chapter 55</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6015</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>165998</id>\n      <parentid>117303</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-17T14:55:33Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10960">{{Infobox Chapter AGoT\n| pov\t\t= [[Catelyn Tully]]\n| place         = [[Moat Cailin]]\n| title\t\t= Catelyn VIII\n| page\t\t= 497\n| previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 54|Daenerys VI]]\n| current\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 55|Catelyn VIII]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 56|Tyrion VII]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 40|Catelyn VII]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 59|Catelyn IX]]\n}} __NOTOC__\n    \n[[Catelyn Tully|Catelyn]] and Ser [[Brynden Tully]] meet [[Robb Stark|Robb]]\xe2\x80\x99s army at [[Moat Cailin]], accompanied by the host from [[House Manderly]]. In private, Catelyn helps Robb refine his war plans and explains to him that they have no option but to win or die. Robb decides to go south in support of [[Riverrun]] with a feint down the [[kingsroad]] to keep Lord [[Tywin Lannister]]\xe2\x80\x99s force occupied.\n\n==Synopsis==  \nAs they approach [[Moat Cailin]], the ancient fortress of the [[First Men]] which guards [[the Neck]], [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] is relieved that they are not too late. She is accompanied by Ser [[Brynden Tully]] and Ser [[Wylis Manderly|Wylis]] and Ser [[Wendel Manderly|Wendel]] [[House Manderly|Manderly]] with their 1,500 men, including 20 knights and 200 mounted men. Their father, Lord [[Wyman Manderly]]\xe2\x80\x94who is too fat to sit a horse\xe2\x80\x94has remained to see to the defenses of [[White Harbor]] but sent his two stout sons, who would have been the fattest men Catelyn had ever seen if she had not met their father.\n\nSer Brynden, upon seeing the fortress, thinks it is a deathtrap. Most of the ancient fortress has long since rotted away leaving only 3 out of 20 towers. Catelyn reassures him that, according to [[Eddard Stark|her husband]], it is more formidable than it seems. The [[Gatehouse Tower|three]] [[Drunkard\'s Tower|remaining]] [[Children\'s Tower|towers]] command the only causeway across the impenetrable bogs of the Neck; to assault any one of the towers an enemy must wade through waist-deep muck and [[lizard-lion]]-infested moats then climb the moss-covered towers while exposed to attack from the other two towers. In addition, there are also supposed to be cold, vengeful ghosts of [[the North]] that hunger for southron blood. Ser Brynden jests that he, as a southron, should not linger in this place. \n\n[[File:Moat cailin by reneaigner.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Moat Cailin - \xc2\xa9 Rene Aigner]]\n\nCatelyn heads for the [[Gatehouse Tower]], understanding the lone [[House Stark|Stark]] banner to mean that [[Robb Stark|Robb]] has made his seat there. She arrives to find Robb surrounded by his father\xe2\x80\x99s bannermen in a drafty hall. At first, Robb does not notice Catelyn, but his [[Grey Wind|wolf]] does. After his bannermen fall quiet, her son looks up and is happy to see her. Each of the lords pay their respects to her, [[Theon Greyjoy]] being the last. He expresses surprise at Catelyn\xe2\x80\x99s presence, so she explains that she learned Robb had called the banners when she came ashore at White Harbor. She then introduces the Manderly brothers and her uncle. \n\nWhen Robb asks, Catelyn explains that she has sent Ser [[Rodrik Cassel|Rodrik]] back to [[Winterfell]] to act as [[castellan]] and to assist [[Maester]] [[Luwin]] in military matters. After some of the lords give Catelyn reassurance that Winterfell is safe, Lord [[Roose Bolton]] states that it is rumored she holds [[Tyrion Lannister]], who would be a good hostage. Catelyn admits she lost the dwarf because the gods saw fit to free him with help from [[Lysa Arryn|her sister]]. Speaking of Lysa, Catelyn recalls that before leaving the [[Eyrie]], she attempted to convince her sister to let her take [[Robert Arryn]] as a fosterling, but Lysa\xe2\x80\x99s rage had been frightening.\n\nCatelyn then sends the bannermen and Theon away to speak to Robb alone. Once they are gone, Catelyn notes that her son looks older, especially with his new beard. Catelyn, who is afraid for her son, notes to Robb that he is only fifteen and leading a host to war. Robb insists that there was no one else. Catelyn argues that he could have given command to any of the bannermen, or even Theon, although he would not have been her choice. Robb responds that none of them are Starks. Catelyn then reminds Robb that he was fighting with wooden swords less than a year ago. Robb\xe2\x80\x99s eyes flare with anger, but he softens and asks if she is sending him back to Winterfell. Catelyn explains that she cannot do such a thing; if she did, the bannermen would lose respect for him, which would hurt him when he becomes Lord of Winterfell one day. Robb\xe2\x80\x99s relief is obvious.\n\nRobb asks if Catelyn knows about Lord Eddard\'s capture and she says she does; [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]]\'s sudden death and Eddard\xe2\x80\x99s fall scared her greatly. Catelyn asks about the girls and Robb tells her that letters addressed to each of them from [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] arrived at Winterfell. Robb returns with a crumpled parchment and hands it to her. She reads it with concern giving way to disbelief, then to anger, and then to fear. She exclaims that it is [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei\xe2\x80\x99s]] letter, and that they have Sansa hostage and mean to keep her. Robb points out that there is no mention of [[Arya Stark|Arya]] and that he was hoping that Catelyn still held Tyrion to exchange for his sisters.\n\n[[File:Robb Stark by AniaEm.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Robb Stark - \xc2\xa9 Anja Dalisa]]\n\nRobb then asks about the knights of [[Vale of Arryn|the Vale]] and is told that Lysa will do nothing; only one knight of the Vale will ride to war: the best, Ser Brynden Tully. Robb asks Catelyn what they are going to do with the 18,000 men he does have. Catelyn can tell that Robb is caught in indecision, which will not do. Knowing he is worried about his father and sisters, Catelyn explains to her son that if he goes to [[King\'s Landing]] to bend the knee he will never be allowed to leave, and if he retreats to Winterfell his lords will lose respect for him. In either case, Cersei can then do as she likes to her captives without fear. Their only hope is that Robb can defeat the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] in the field; Cersei cannot harm her captives because she will need them as hostages if things go against her. However, if Robb loses there is no hope for any of them and they will suffer the fate of the [[Sack of King\'s Landing|Targaryen children]]; there is naught but stone at the heart of [[Casterly Rock]]. Robb states that that makes it simple: he will not lose. \n\nCatelyn then asks about the situation in the [[Riverlands]]. Robb informs her that [[War of the Five Kings#War in the Riverlands|the war]] has begun. A fortnight past, Ser [[Jaime Lannister]] [[Battle of the Golden Tooth|smashed]] the [[House Tully|Tully]] force led by Lords [[House Vance of Wayfarer\'s Rest|Vance]] and [[Clement Piper|Piper]] at the [[Golden Tooth]] and is now advancing on [[Riverrun]]. Meanwhile, Lord [[Tywin Lannister]] has come up from the south with an even larger army. This army [[Battle at the Mummer\'s Ford|ambushed]] the party of Lord [[Beric Dondarrion]] sent to bring Gregor Clegane to justice, killing [[Raymun Darry]] and most of the men from Winterfell. Lord Beric may have escaped, but no one knows for sure. Now Lord Tywin is marching north to [[Harrenhal]], burning as he goes.\n\nThe news is worse than Catelyn imagined. She asks Robb if he plans to await Lord Tywin\xe2\x80\x99s army at Moat Cailin, but Robb says that no one thinks that Tywin will be stupid enough to come that far; instead he will take the castles of the river lords one by one. Robb believes that they should march south to meet him. Catelyn questions the idea of leaving their strong position at Moat Cailin, fearing that her son has no chance against seasoned battle commanders like Tywin and Jaime Lannister. Robb explains that his supplies are running low and that an army the size of his cannot live off this land forever; now that Lord Manderly\xe2\x80\x99s force has arrived, they need to march. Catelyn realizes the truth in what Robb says, remembering that Robb\xe2\x80\x99s is not a standing army, but a levy of fishermen and farmers that will not stay cohesive if left idle. \n\nDeclaring that marching is all well and good, Catelyn asks Robb where he plans on marching \'\'to\'\'. Again Robb is uncertain; the Greatjon believes they should take the battle to Lord Tywin, while others think they should join with Ser [[Edmure Tully]] to defend Riverrun. Catelyn tells her son that, since he appointed himself battle commander, he must command; he cannot appear indecisive in front of his lords.\n\nCatelyn asks Robb again what he intends to do. He declares that both plans have their merits, but he does not think a commander as experienced as Lord Tywin will be easily surprised and his forces are too strong to defeat easily. Robb decides to have his infantry continue down the [[Kingsroad]] but to send his horse across the [[Trident#Green Fork|Green Fork]] and then south to relieve Riverrun. This will put the river between his two forces but also between Tywin and Jaime. However, the only available crossing of the Green Fork is at [[the Twins]], which is controlled by [[House Frey]]. Although a bannerman to [[House Tully]], Lord [[Walder Frey]] has never been the most loyal; all Catelyn can think of is that the \xe2\x80\x9cLate\xe2\x80\x9d Lord Frey failed to arrive at the [[Battle of the Trident]] until after the battle was done. She tells Robb that [[Hoster Tully|her father]] has never trusted Lord Walder and that he should not either. \n\nCatelyn, impressed by Robb\xe2\x80\x99s plan, asks who will command each force. Robb informs her of his plan to lead the mounted force to Riverrun himself, while command of his main army of foot soldiers moving south to intercept Lord Tywin will be given to the Greatjon. In an attempt to show Robb his error, Catelyn points out that his father considered the Greatjon one of his most fearless men, but that his father is not fearless; he is brave, but that is different. Robb reconsiders and decides he needs a man of caution and cold cunning to lead the main force. Robb realizes that he should put [[Roose Bolton]], whose cold cunning scares even him, in command; hopefully Bolton will scare Lord Tywin as well. \n\nRobb states that he wants Catelyn to return to Winterfell. She insists that her father is dying and her brother is surrounded by foes; her place is with them at Riverrun.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/10/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-27 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/056/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 55]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Catelyn Tully]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Moat Cailin]]\n\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 56, Catelyn]][[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\x9a\xd0\xb5\xd0\xb9\xd1\x82\xd0\xb8\xd0\xbb\xd0\xb8\xd0\xbd VIII]]</text>\n      <sha1>nf6cjff7o0j1ocicv6rz4piohnqdwtd</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Feast for Crows-Chapter 22</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5671</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166964</id>\n      <parentid>166953</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-06-05T19:22:35Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3543">{{Infobox Chapter AFfC\n| pov\t\t= [[Arya Stark]]\n| title\t\t= Arya II\n| place         = [[Braavos]]\n| page\t\t= 312\n| previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 21|Chapter 21]]\n| current\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 22|Arya II]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 23|Alayne I]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 6|Arya I]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 34|Cat of the Canals]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\nEvery day, the [[kindly man]] asks [[Arya Stark|Arya]] who she is. When she replies &quot;no one&quot;, he tells her that she lies, trying to get her to forget her true self and give up her past, but Arya resists. She works hard in the temple, cleaning and doing other chores. She witnesses many people entering the temple, some to light candles, others to curl up near a statue to die, and others to speak in private to the kindly man. When asked whose names she whispers at night, she finally admits that they are people she wants to kill, but the priest tells her that it is the [[Many-Faced God]] who determines who shall die, not her. He also finally convinces her to dispose of her possessions, and she does so with all but [[Needle]], which she hides outside the temple under a stone. Once she has done this, the kindly man comes to her and tells her some of their history. \n\nThe [[Faceless Men]] are older than [[Braavos]], having started amongst the slaves working the mines beneath the volcanoes of the [[Valyrian Freehold]]. The slaves worked under the harshest of conditions, and since they came from many different nations, they all prayed to different gods. But one amongst them (although he may have actually been a noble\'s  son or an overseer, no one knows) realized that they were actually all praying to one god- one who could set them free from their torture.\n\nThe kindly man does not finish the story, but now Arya is a novice at the temple, and she and the [[waif]] begin to teach each other their respective languages. As Arya learns Braavosi, the waif also teaches her how to read a lie on someone\'s face, and Arya discovers that the girl is actually well over thirty years old, having taken &quot;poisons&quot; as part of her sacrifice to become Faceless. One day, when other priests of the Many-Faced God visit the temple, Arya asks the kindly man how to change her face, as [[Jaqen H\'ghar]] did. While the priest knows not the name, he tells her it takes years of prayer, sacrifice and study to accomplish what he could do. Still, Arya wishes to learn, so he tells her to begin training the muscles of her face in front of a mirror every day. The next day, the kindly man tells Arya that she must leave the temple for a while, so as to learn the Braavosi tongue by being amongst them all the time. He instructs her to find a fishmonger named [[Brusco]], but to not reveal who she really is. Arya decides to use the name &quot;Cat&quot;, pretending to be an orphan girl from [[King\'s Landing]].\n\n==References and Notes==\n* The synopsis was copied from AoL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/05/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-feast-for-crows-part-16 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Feast for Crows, Part 16].

When the orphan boy known as [[Hot Pie]] tries to steal her sword \xe2\x80\x9c[[Needle]],\xe2\x80\x9d Arya beats him bloody. Yoren takes her aside for punishment and reveals that [[Eddard Stark|her father]] was supposed to be allowed to take the black, rather than be executed.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:Amokaarya.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Arya Stark as Arry the orphan \xe2\x80\x93 by Amok\xc2\xa9]]\n\nArya used to think her nickname of \xe2\x80\x9cArya Horseface\xe2\x80\x9d was bad, until the orphan boy [[Lommy Greenhands]] named her \xe2\x80\x9cLumpyhead\xe2\x80\x9d because of her lumpy, uneven haircut. Her head actually feels lumpy when she touches it.\n\nWhen [[Yoren]] dragged her into an alley after [[Eddard Stark|her father]]\xe2\x80\x99s [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 65|execution]], Arya was sure he meant to kill her. Instead, the smelly old [[Night\'s Watch|black brother]] had only cut her hair and promised to deliver her to her home at [[Winterfell]] when he and his new recruits pass by. However, Yoren insisted that she pretend to be an orphan boy named Arry because half of the new recruits would turn her over to Queen [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] quick as spit for a pardon and a few silvers, and the other half would do the same but rape her first. Yoren claimed it should not be too hard to pass as a boy; the hardest part would be passing her water in the woods alone.\n\nThere are 30 of them; some of the recruits are orphan boys recruited with promises of food and clothing, but others are criminals from the dungeons under the [[Red Keep]]. The most frightening are the three from the [[black cells]], whom Yoren keeps chained in the back of a wagon. The five wagons contain supplies for the Wall: hides, bars of pig iron, a cage of ravens, cloth, books, paper, ink, [[sourleaf]], oil, medicine, and spices. \n\n[[File:Yoren.jpg|thumb|170px|right|Yoren of the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch \xe2\x80\x93 by Amok\xc2\xa9]]\n\nThe gates of [[King\'s Landing]] were easy to pass, just as Yoren claimed. The [[House Lannister|Lannister]] guards were searching for the highborn daughter of the [[Hand of the King]], not a skinny boy with his hair chopped off. Yoren called one of them by name and they were waved through. As they were leaving, Arya wished that [[Blackwater Rush]] would rise and wash away the city until she remembered [[Sansa Stark|her sister]] would be washed away, too. Instead, she decided to wish for Winterfell.\n\nYoren was wrong about passing water being the hardest part. The men ignore her, but the orphan boys Lommy Greenhands and [[Hot Pie]] take her silence to mean she is frightened, stupid, or deaf. Arya is two years younger and quite a bit smaller than them. One morning, Lommy and Hot Pie begin questioning Arya about her sword, \xe2\x80\x9c[[Needle]],\xe2\x80\x9d wondering where she got it. Hot Pie sarcastically suggests that maybe she was a squire, but Lommy disagrees and argues that Needle is probably not even a real sword. Arya angrily shouts back that it is castle-forged steel, but this only gives rise to claims that she stole it. This angers Arya even more because Needle was a gift from her bastard brother [[Jon Snow]], and she will not let them call him a thief. \n\nThen Hot Pie gets the idea that he can steal Needle from her and Lommy encourages him. Hot Pie\xe2\x80\x99s declaration that she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even know how to use a sword takes Arya back to the stable boy she stabbed during her [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 50|escape]] from the [[Red Keep]], but she doesn\'t mention the incident. The boys continue to mock her, saying that she is going to cry and wet her pants.\n\n[[Gendry|The Bull]]\xe2\x80\x94an older boy with shaggy black hair and a bull-motif helmet\xe2\x80\x94tells them to let her be, but Hot Pie continues. Arya attempts to diffuse the situation by offering to surrender her wooden practice sword, but Hot Pie threatens to beat her up like he did another boy and reaches for Needle. Arya uses her practice sword to whack Hot Pie\xe2\x80\x99s donkey. The animal bucks and throws Hot Pie to the ground. Arya dismounts and breaks his nose with her practice sword before turning on Lommy, who cowers away in fear. The Bull shouts a warning and Arya turns to face Hot Pie. The injured boy throws a rock at her, but Arya ducks and closes the distance to strike him again on the hand, cheek, knee, and back of the head. Dazed and wounded, Hot Pie attempts to charge her, but Arya slips into a [[Water Dancer]] pose and stabs the boy in the groin.\n\nBy the time Yoren pulls her off, Arya has hit Hot Pie a dozen more times and the boy\xe2\x80\x99s pants are brown and smelly. Yoren drags her off the road into a tangle of trees, cursing and muttering. There he orders her to drop her breeches and scream loudly, then whacks her several times with her own stick sword. Arya does not want to scream, but cannot help it, and her thighs and cheeks are ablaze with pain. \n\nWhen he is finished, Yoren tells her that if she ever uses her stick sword on one of her companions again she will get twice what she gives. Yoren also explains that however much her punishment hurt, Hot Pie is feeling much worse. He points out that Hot Pie and Lommy had no part in her father\xe2\x80\x99s death and hitting them won\xe2\x80\x99t bring him back. Arya says she knows that. Yoren goes on to explain that he was set to leave when he received a message to wait for Lord Eddard, who was supposed to be allowed to take the black, only something went queer. Arya blames King [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] and declares someone should kill him. Yoren replies that someone will, but not him and not her.\n\nAfterward, Arya is unable to sit a donkey for several days, but Hot Pie is unable to do anything but lie in the back of a wagon for even longer and Lommy stays as far away from her as possible. The Bull points out that Lommy twitches whenever she looks at him now. Arya does not answer since it seems safer not to talk. That night, while looking up at the sky, the Bull calls the [[red comet]] the \xe2\x80\x9cRed Sword,\xe2\x80\x9d saying that it looks like a sword fresh from the forge. Arya can see it as a sword as well, but to her it is her father\xe2\x80\x99s greatsword [[Ice]], covered with her father\xe2\x80\x99s blood as it was after his head was cut off.\n\nWhen she finally falls asleep, Arya dreams of Winterfell. She longs to see [[Catelyn Stark|her mother]], [[Robb Stark|Robb]], [[Bran Stark|Bran]], and [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]], but more than anyone she misses her brother [[Jon Snow|Jon]] on the Wall. She wishes that somehow they could come to the Wall before Winterfell, just so she could see Jon again.\n\n==References and Notes==\n\n* [http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2010/01/prologue-arya.html Humorous review of the chapter] by Jason.\n* [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2011/03/re-read-arya-i.html Review in the course of a 10th reread] by Slynt.\n* [http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/01/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-1 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 01]] \n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Arya Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in the Crownlands]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place along the Kingsroad]]\n\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 1]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 02, Arya]][[zh:&amp;#21015;&amp;#29579;&amp;#30340;&amp;#32439;&amp;#20105;-&amp;#31456;&amp;#33410; 1]]</text>\n      <sha1>nm7so3ojx5hj5v7c79aq7yljbubr9o4</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Game of Thrones-Chapter 60</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6020</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166003</id>\n      <parentid>160758</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-17T14:56:31Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9411">{{Infobox Chapter AGoT\n| pov\t\t= [[Jon Snow]]\n| place         = [[Castle Black]]\n| title\t\t= Jon VIII\n| page\t\t= 544\n| previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 59|Catelyn IX]]\n| current\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 60|Jon VIII]] \n| next\t\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 61|Daenerys VII]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 52|Jon VII]] \n| arc next\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 70|Jon IX]] \n}} __NOTOC__\n\n[[Jon Snow|Jon]] is presented with the [[Valyrian steel]] sword [[Longclaw]] by [[Lord Commander of the Night\'s Watch|Lord Commander]] [[Jeor Mormont|Mormont]]. Jon attempts to refuse, but the commander insists. Later, Jon gets a message that Maester [[Aemon Targaryen (son of Maekar I)|Aemon]] wants to see him. The maester knows that Jon is divided between his duty and his family loyalties and explains that he sympathizes. When Jon rejects his empathy, the old man reveals that he is Aemon Targaryen, son of King [[Maekar I Targaryen|Maekar I]].\n\n==Synopsis==    \n[[Jon Snow|Jon]] lies that he is well when asked by [[Lord Commander of the Night\'s Watch|Lord Commander]] [[Jeor Mormont|Mormont]]. His right hand is swathed in bandages halfway to the elbow and pains him constantly. When he threw the burning curtains onto the [[Others#Wights|wight]] of [[Othor]], Jon burned his hand more seriously than he realized, but Maester [[Aemon Targaryen (son of Maekar I)|Aemon]] has assured him that there will be no permanent damage aside from the scars. Jon is glad, however, that only [[Ghost]] can see him writhe and weep from the pain at night. Yet, when he does manage to sleep, Jon has nightmares of battling a wight with [[Eddard Stark|his father]]\xe2\x80\x99s face that are far worse.\n\nJon notices that the Lord Commander looks old and grumpy without his beard, which has been shaved after it was badly singed in the fire. Mormont explains to Jon that the rangers\xe2\x80\x99 search has found no sign of [[Benjen Stark|his uncle]] or more wights; two of those were bad enough. Still both Mormont and Maester Aemon are sure there will be more because the cold winds are rising. \n\nJon states there was a bird last night, saying he hoped for news of his father. Mormont assures Jon that he would have told him if there was. This message brought word that Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] has been cast out of the [[Kingsguard]] and is now wanted for treason, having killed two [[City Watch of King\'s Landing|gold cloaks]] sent to arrest him. Mormont\xe2\x80\x99s distaste is plain for men who would send gold cloaks to arrest a knight as renowned of Ser Barristan the Bold. The Lord Commander goes on to lament that they have [[Others|white shadows]] in the woods, [[Others#Wights|undead]] stalking the halls, and a [[Joffrey Baratheon|boy]] on the [[Iron Throne]]. \n\nMormont notes that Grand Maester [[Pycelle]] did not include any news about Jon\xe2\x80\x99s sisters; they only tell the Night\'s Watch what they want them to know. Jon thinks that \'\'he\'\' is only told what Mormont want \'\'him\'\' to know; he has heard nothing of his brother [[Robb Stark]] in the south. \n\n[[File:Longclaw, Sword of Jon Snow.jpg|thumb|80px|left|Longclaw]]\n\nMormont asks when Maester Aemon believes Jon will be able to resume using his hand. Jon says soon and the Lord Commander brings out a sword, declaring that Jon is ready for it. Jon is puzzled but is told to take the sword. He recognizes it as a [[bastard sword]] of [[Valyrian steel]]. Mormont explains that the sword is named [[Longclaw]] and has belonged to [[House Mormont]] for five centuries. After it was burned in the fire in his tower, Mormont has had the pommel remade into the likeness of a white wolf\'s head with red garnets for eyes.\n\nWhen he was young, Jon dreamed of doing great deeds and being granted [[Ice]] in reward for saving his father\xe2\x80\x99s life, but he knew it was a folly. Now the memory that he might wish to steal his brother\xe2\x80\x99s birthright shames him. Jon does not feel that he deserves Longclaw either and attempts to decline, but Mormont insists he has earned it with his quick thinking to use fire to destroy the wight. Jon accepts, but reminds himself that Mormont is not his father and he still dreams of Ice. \n\nMormont tells Jon that he will now have to practice his two-handed strokes as well, suggesting that Ser [[Endrew Tarth]] from the [[Shadow Tower]], who will assume the duties of master-at-arms, can help him. Ser [[Alliser Thorne]] has been sent to [[King\'s Landing]] with the hand of [[Jafer Flowers]] to attempt to get the boy king\xe2\x80\x99s attention. Mormont explains that a message from an anointed high-born knight should get more attention than from an old crow. It also puts a thousand leagues between Jon and Ser Alliser. \n\nMormont insists, however, that none of this means that he approves of Jon\xe2\x80\x99s actions: it takes a man to wield Longclaw and he expects Jon to act the part. Jon agrees, thinking again that it is not the blade he would have chosen, but a fine one. He is also glad to be free from Ser Alliser. Then Mormont sends Jon to fetch his supper. As he leaves, Jon sees the guards smiling; one man comments on the sword\xe2\x80\x99s quality and another tells Jon he earned it. Jon is angry but cannot say why. \n\nOutside, Jon\xe2\x80\x99s friends are waiting for him, wanting to see the sword. Pyp jokes that Jon is probably the only man in the entire history of the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch to be rewarded for burning down the Lord Commander\'s Tower. Even Jon has to smile; no one blames him for setting the fire that destroyed the wight, even if it did gut the top two floors of the tower. The other wight was hacked to pieces, but not before killing Ser [[Jaremy Rykker]] and four other men. The thought of the wights sours Jon\xe2\x80\x99s mood and he quickly leaves his friends to get the Lord Commander\xe2\x80\x99s supper. Jon is deeply affected by facing the wight, but does not blame his friends for not understanding. They cannot understand; they did not see the pale glow of the blue eyes or feel the cold black hands. They also do not know of the fighting in the [[riverlands]]. \n\nGhost is lying beside the door to his room. Jon thinks back to when he found the [[direwolf]] hidden in the snow. He shows Ghost the pommel of the swords, stating it is him. Then [[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] arrives. He does not want to see the blade, stating he has seen his father\xe2\x80\x99s Valyrian steel [[Heartsbane|blade]] and it was so sharp he feared he might hurt one of his sisters. Sam then announces that Maester Aemon wants to see Jon. Jon is puzzled since it is not time for his bandages to be changed, but then accuses Sam of telling the maester that he knows about the riverlands. Sam insists that he thinks the maester knew anyway. Jon tells Sam that he will find the maester himself.\n\n[[Clydas]] is helping Maester Aemon in the rookery when Jon arrives. The maester dismisses Clydas and asks Jon to assist him with feeding the ravens. As they work, Aemon explains that although other birds can be trained to fly messages the [[Night\'s Watch]] has always preferred ravens. The old man goes on to explain that the sworn brothers do not wed because love is the bane of honor and duty, which the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch cannot afford; they must be totally committed to defending the realm from the darkness to the north. \n\nWhen Jon fails to understand, the maester explains that in every man\xe2\x80\x99s life there comes a day when he must choose between his duty and his family, and only one man in ten thousand is strong enough to choose duty. Jon questions if the maester believes this is his day. Maester Aemon only replies that he knows the choice is always hard. Jon insists that the old man does not know what it feels like to be in his situation. \n\nMaester Aemon sighs and sadly tells Jon that his vows have been tested three times: once as a boy, once in his prime, and once as an old man. The old maester elaborates that the last test was just as hard as the others, regardless that he was blind, frail, and helpless. He recalls how it grieved him to sit forgotten as his ravens brought news from the south of the ruin of his House and the death of his [[Aerys II Targaryen|brother\xe2\x80\x99s grandson]], and [[Rhaegar Targaryen|\'\'his\'\' son]], and even the [[Rhaenys Targaryen (daughter of Rhaegar)|\'\'little\'\']] [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaegar)|\'\'children\'\']].\n\nJon asks who Maester Aemon is, almost in dread. The old man insists that he is only a maester of the [[Citadel]] bound to [[Castle Black]] and the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch, but that his father was [[Maekar I Targaryen|Maekar]], the First of His Name, and that his brother [[Aegon V Targaryen|Aegon]] ruled after their father in his stead. Jon is astounded. Aemon declares that he \'\'does\'\' know how Jon feels, and so he will not tell Jon to stay or go. Jon must make his own choice, and live with it for the rest of his days as Aemon has.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/10/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-29 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/061/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 60]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Jon Snow]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Castle Black]]\n\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 60]]\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 61, Jon]]\n[[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\x94\xd0\xb6\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbd VIII]]</text>\n      <sha1>26dchtrp4tbi4whoejvdl4hhxplv9uh</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Feast for Crows-Chapter 30</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5722</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166958</id>\n      <parentid>142448</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-06-05T19:18:06Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3902">{{Infobox Chapter AFfC\n| pov\t\t= [[Jaime Lannister]]\n| place\t\t= [[Darry]]\n| title\t\t= Jaime IV\n| page\t\t= 445\n| previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 29|The Reaver]]\n| current\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 30|Jaime IV]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 31|Brienne VI]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 27|Jaime III]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 33|Jaime V]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]\'s small host reaches Castle [[Darry]], and he finds himself contemplating the genius of his uncle [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]] for his choice of a bride for [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], [[Amerei Frey]], whose mother is a [[House Darry|Darry]]. \n\nHe has dispatched [[Ronnet Connington|Red Ronnet]] to accompany [[Wylis Manderly]] to [[Maidenpool]], but nevertheless he has too many men to be fed at his cousin\'s new castle. Jaime takes note of all the armed [[House Frey|Freys]] and &quot;sparrows&quot; in the castle, far outnumbering Lannister men. Darry\'s maester greets Ser Jaime, surprised by this unexpected visit, and tells him that Kevan departed right after the wedding, and that Lancel is praying in the sept. The maester provides him with Lancel\'s own room, since Jaime\'s cousin has taken to sleeping in the sept. As Jaime bathes before the guest feast, he notices that [[Josmyn Peckledon]], his new squire, wishes to bed [[Pia]]. Jaime tells him to use Lancel\'s room for his first bedding, saying, &quot;You\'ll feel a lord yourself when you\'re done, if Pia knows her business.&quot; But Jaime warns him to treat her kindly, perhaps due to his own guilt for refusing the girl when [[Qyburn]] sent her during his recuperation at [[Harrenhal]].\n\nAt the feast, Jaime learns that his cousin has been fasting since the old [[High Septon]] died. Lancel also does not join them for dinner. Lady Amerei begs Jaime to stay and help them defeat Lord [[Beric Dondarrion]], the [[Sandor Clegane|Hound]], and the other outlaws. He learns that the outlaws seem to be following [[Lady Stoneheart|a woman]] now, cloaked and hooded, and no one has seen Beric Dondarrion for a while. Jaime\'s companion [[Lyle Crakehall|Strongboar]] claims to be moved by Ami\'s words, and promises to return after they take [[Riverrun]] to sort out the Hound. Jaime leaves the table and goes to the sept. Three armed sparrows bar his path, but Lancel lets him in. \n\nLancel admits that his father left after they quarrelled, and that he does not intend to consummate his marriage. And then he admits his greatest sins: serving the wine that resulted in King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]]\'s death, and that he had been sleeping with [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]]. \n\nLancel states that he plans to forsake his title as Lord of Darry, and head to [[King\'s Landing]] to swear vows as a [[Warrior\'s Sons|Warrior\'s Son]]. When Jaime learns that Cersei has rearmed the faith, he is almost as upset by this as he is to discover that [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] was not lying about Cersei\'s infidelity. Later, in the yard, Jaime admits to Ser [[Ilyn Payne|Ilyn]] that he slept with Cersei when she was at Castle Darry with Robert. Cersei wanted him to get [[Arya Stark]] and he would have killed her had he found her first.\n\n==References and Notes==\n* The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/07/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-feast-for-crows-part-22 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Feast for Crows, Part 22].

[[Roose Bolton]] comments that the northern gods do not favour [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] as he is at the mercy of the weather while they are sheltered in Winterfell. His men cheer, but [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] does not join in and notes that the [[House Frey|Freys]] do not join in either, unfamiliar with the north that has claimed three of their lives already.\n\n[[Wyman Manderly]] is eating at a feast of porridge, while [[Harwood Stout]] and [[Hother Umber|Whoresbane Umber]] chat. Theon spent the whole last night awake dreaming of escape, but ultimately decides he has no where to go; he is a ruined man in a ruined castle, and this is where he belongs. The bard Abel plays &quot;[[The Dornishman\'s Wife]]&quot; with one of his women beating a drum, but he switches the lyrics to a northman instead. Theon fears that this will be seen as a spite to the [[House Bolton|Boltons]], cost the man his life, angering Ramsay and getting Theon flayed as a result. But when both of the Boltons laugh, the others see that it is safe so they laugh as well and join in with the bawdy song.\n\nHis thoughts fall to [[Jeyne Poole|the fake Arya]], taking note that she has remained locked away in her room. There are whispers that [[Ramsay Bolton|Ramsay]] keeps her chained naked to the bed, but Theon believes that it is only the guards that keep her there. He has seen bruises on her body as [[Sour Alyn]] has assigned Theon as Jeyne\'s handmaid. Theon told her that Ramsay only hurts people when they make him angry, so she should do as he says and no harm will come to her. But she only cried and called him Theon, and he corrected her, telling her that his name is Reek.\n\n[[Rowan]], one of the bard\'s women, comes up to Theon and asks him about his exploits, telling him that Abel can make a song about his capture of Winterfell. She questions him on how he was able to conquer Winterfell so easily, wondering if there was a secret entrance or another way that he used to get in. Theon thinks this is another ploy from Ramsay as he desires Rowan, so he runs away, leaving her.\n\nOutside there is a snowball fight between boys from the [[Rills]] and [[Barrowton]], while squires build snowmen along the battlements. Theon observes that a new stable has been built, twice as large as the one that was burned down. He wanders through the castle and passes [[Rickard Ryswell]] cuddling one of Abel\'s women. He observes that they have few provisions to last the winter in the keep, but thinks that Stannis is in the same situation. He eventually arrives at the [[weirwood]], kneeling before the heart tree. There he apologizes for something, and asks for something that he is unsure of - strength? He hears someone crying and leaves, thinking that there are ghosts in Winterfell, and he is one of them.\n\nTheon returns and sees that to command the snowmen, the squires have built a dozen snowy lords, including ones resembling Lord [[Wyman Manderly]], Lord [[Harwood Stout]], Lady [[Barbrey Dustin]], and [[Whoresbane Umber]]. Lady Dustin asks him if he can show her the way to the crypts, as she cannot access them from the dungeons. As her men dig through the snow, Lady Dustin asks Theon to convince Ramsay to treat Arya better. The northmen love the [[House Stark|Starks]] and hate the Boltons, remaining loyal only out of fear. The tears of Arya Stark will upset them and do Roose and Ramsay more harm than anything Stannis could do.  \n\nInside the crypts they find that some of the dead kings\' swords are missing. A bad omen, Theon thinks, as the swords are said to protect the crypt and keep the spirits of the dead from wandering. Dustin asks Theon why he loves the Starks, and Theon reluctantly explains he always wanted to be one, but never could. Dustin remarks that they are similar in that regard, explaining how [[Brandon Stark]] took her maidenhead and was enamored with her rather than with his betrothed, [[Catelyn Tully]]. [[Rickard Stark]] arranged the betrothal of his eldest son to Catelyn, a match that served his ambitions more than one to Lady Barbrey, a daughter of one of his own northern vassals.  After Brandon\'s betrothal to Catelyn, the ambitious Lord Ryswell wanted Barbrey to marry [[Eddard Stark|Eddard]], but after Rickard and Brandon were both murdered by [[Aerys II Targaryen|the Mad King]], Eddard fulfilled his older brother\xe2\x80\x99s betrothal to Catelyn to ensure support from [[Riverrun]] during [[Robert\'s Rebellion]]. Left to marry Lord [[Willam Dustin]], she blames Ned for Lord Dustin\'s death at the [[Tower of Joy]] during Robert\'s Rebellion. She felt slighted that Eddard merely buried her husband in [[Dorne]], yet went to great lengths to transport [[Lyanna Stark|his sister\'s]] body north to be buried at Winterfell. \n\nShe claims that she intends to seize Ned Stark\'s bones, delayed by the Iron Born\'s occupation of [[Moat Cailin]], and feed them to her dogs, rather than let them be buried in the crypt. On the way back up she tells him to repeat nothing to the Boltons. Theon swears he will not, to which she says he has been trained well, leaving him there.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n* [[Theon Greyjoy]]\n* [[Stannis]]\n* [[Roose Bolton]]\n* [[Aenys Frey]]\n* [[Hosteen Frey]]\n* [[Ramsay Snow]]\n* [[Wyman Manderly]]\n* [[Harwood Stout]]\n* [[Hother Umber]]\n* [[Jeyne Poole]]\n* [[Kyra]]\n* [[Mance Rayder|Abel]]\n* [[Yellow Dick]]\n* [[Sour Alyn]]\n* [[Walda Frey (daughter of Merrett)]]\n* [[Barbrey Dustin]]\n* [[Sansa Stark]]\n* [[Walder Frey (son of Merrett)]]\n* [[Myrtle]]\n* [[Holly]]\n* [[Rowan]]\n* [[Luwin]]\n* [[Catelyn Tully]]\n* [[Mikken]]\n* [[Rickard Ryswell]]\n* [[Bran]]\n* [[Eddard Stark]]\n* [[Robert Baratheon]]\n* [[Robb Stark]]\n* [[Beron (serjeant)|Beron]]\n* [[Torrhen Stark]]\n* [[Edrick Stark]]\n* [[Brandon the Shipwright]]\n* [[Beron Stark]]\n* [[Theon Stark]]\n* [[Dagon Greyjoy]]\n* [[Rickon Stark]]\n* [[Rickard Stark]]\n* [[Lord Dustin]]\n* [[Rodrik Ryswell]]\n* [[Willam Dustin]]\n}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 41]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Theon Greyjoy]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Winterfell]]\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 41]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 42, Le tourne-casaque]]</text>\n      <sha1>izekszosjfl6r7g9xmb0b88147ttgeg</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Clash of Kings-Prologue</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5644</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>181333</id>\n      <parentid>166390</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-02-28T16:22:07Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20074">{{Infobox Chapter ACfK\n| pov\t\t= Maester [[Cressen]]\n| place         = [[Dragonstone]]\n| title\t\t= Prologue\n| page\t\t= 1\n| previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Appendix|Appendix]]\n| current\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Prologue|Prologue]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 1|Arya I]]\n| arc previous\t= \n| arc next\t= \n}}\n    \nMaester [[Cressen]] broods on the omens all around him on [[Dragonstone]]. When news arrives that the [[Stormlands|storm lords]] will not support [[Stannis Baratheon]]\xe2\x80\x99s quest for the [[Iron Throne]], Cressen comes into conflict with Queen [[Selyse Florent|Selyse]] and the red priestess [[Melisandre]] over what course to take. In a desperate attempt to kill Melisandre, Cressen shares poison wine with her, but dies while she remains unaffected.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:Dragonstone (day).jpg|thumb|280px|left|Dragonstone - \xc2\xa9 HBO]]\n\nMaester [[Cressen]] watches from his balcony as the [[red comet]] spreads across the dawn over [[Dragonstone]] like a wound in the sky. The feeble 80-year-old chides himself for considering it an omen, yet he has never seen a comet so bright nor of that color. It is even visible during the day now. At the same time, hot steam has begun to issue from vents beneath the Dragonmont volcano, and a [[white raven]] has arrived from the [[Citadel]], declaring the end of the longest summer in living memory (10 years, two turns and 16 days); too many omens to deny. It is enough to make any man believe in omens, but the old [[maester]] cannot decide what they might mean.\n\nCressen\xe2\x80\x99s eventual successor Maester [[Pylos]] interrupts his thoughts with word that Princess [[Shireen Baratheon|Shireen]] wishes to see the white raven. The title \xe2\x80\x9cprincess\xe2\x80\x9d is a new appellation for the young girl, now that her father, [[Stannis Baratheon]], is a king. Cressen bids Pylos to show her in. The shy princess enters, followed by her shuffling fool [[Patchface]], who wears a mock helm made from a bucket with antlers and cowbells. Perhaps once Patchface was a good fool, but now he has lost his wits and is incoherent as often as not. Only Shireen laughs at his antics or cares about him at all. Shireen\xe2\x80\x99s face is unattractive even discounting the disfigurement from a bout of [[greyscale]] that nearly claimed her life as an infant. Shireen asks to see the white raven, and the maester will not deny her since she has been denied too much during her life of almost ten years. She is the saddest child the maester has ever known and he considers her another mark of his failures. \n\nWhile Pylos goes to fetch the white raven, Cressen thinks how the solemn 25-year-old Pylos is not a good match for Dragonstone because grim places need lightening. However, a maester does not choose his post, and Cressen recalls coming to Dragonstone himself 12 years ago with his lord, though he never liked it here and never considered it home. Of late, when he wakes from restless nightmares of the [[Melisandre|red woman]], Cressen often does not know where he is.\n\nCressen asks Shireen why she is up so early. The girl explains that she had nightmares of dragons coming to eat her. The maester remembers that she has always had nightmares. Thinking of the many dragon-inspired statues and buildings of Dragonstone, Cressen attempts to comfort her by explaining that Dragonstone was once the westernmost outpost of the ancient Freehold of [[Valyria]]. The dragon towers were created to make the fortress seem more formidable. He explains that the Valryians had long-forgotten ways of shaping stone and used them to make the thousands of stone dragons on the island. Shireen is unconvinced, telling him that the red woman says the thing in the sky is dragon\xe2\x80\x99s breath. Cressen explains that it is only a comet and will be gone soon.\n\n[[File:Whiteraven.jpg|thumb|300px|left|A white raven - by Alberto Aprea \xc2\xa9FFG]]\n\nShireen states that her mother says the white raven means it is not summer any more, and the maester confirms that it is true. He then goes on to tell her about the white ravens, and how the Citadel has determined that summer is over. Cressen says that it is hoped that there will be a warm autumn with bountiful harvests. He knows that a long summer is said to bring a long winter, but does not want to frighten the child. When she asks if it will snow, the maester says it will, but he prays it will not be for years yet. Then, Pylos returns with the white raven, and the maester introduces the raven to Shireen. Shireen is delighted to learn that it can speak.\n\nPatchface begins to sing, \xe2\x80\x9cThe shadows came to dance, my lord, dance my lord, dance my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d hopping from one foot to the other, \xe2\x80\x9cThe shadows came to stay, my lord, stay my lord, stay my lord.\xe2\x80\x9d He jerks his head with each word, and his bells make a clangor. Shireen declares that Patchface has been singing that song often lately and it scares her. She asks the maester to make him stop. Cressen thinks back to how the old Lord [[Steffon Baratheon]] found the fool in [[Volantis]] while seeking a wife for [[Rhaegar Targaryen]]. Upon their return journey, within sight of [[Storm\'s End|home]], their ship sank, killing everyone aboard. Patchface was washed up on the shore three days later, naked, cold, and clammy. They took him for dead, but then he coughed up water and survived, albeit broken in mind and body, hardly capable of speech let alone wit. Many suggested that it would be kindest for Cressen to let the mad boy die, but he refused, and now he wonders at that decision. Cressen assures Shireen that Patchface is just rambling and does not comprehend any of what he says.\n\nPylos, who went to fetch Cressen\xe2\x80\x99s breakfast, returns to inform him that Ser [[Davos Seaworth]] returned during the night and has been with Stannis most of the night. Cressen complains that he should have been notified, as it is his duty to advise the king. Asking pardons of Shireen, the old man has Pylos help him hobble with his bad hips to the Stone Drum, the main keep of Dragonstone. He passes windows from which he can see 3,000 men in the camp outside the wall, and the anchorage filled with ships since no ship that has come within sight of Dragonstone has been allowed to leave. \n\n[[File:Davos Seaworth.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Davos Seaworth, the Onion Knight - by Amoka\xc2\xa9]]\n\nOnce inside the Stone Drum, Cressen leaves Pylos, stating he wants to see Stannis alone. As he ascends the stairs he regrets leaving Pylos. He meets Ser Davos coming down the stairs. Davos reveals that his mission as envoy to the [[Stormlands]] has been a failure. It is as Cressen warned: the lords sworn to [[Storm\'s End]] have no love for Stannis and will not support his claim. Instead, they have joined with the lords of the [[Reach]] in supporting Stannis\xe2\x80\x99 younger brother, [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]].\n\nNews of Renly claiming the crown leads Cressen to worry for the youngest [[House Baratheon|Baratheon]]. When Ser Davos mentions that Renly has instituted a [[Rainbow Guard|new Kingsguard]], Cressen recalls that Renly was always fond of games and rich bright fabrics as a child. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at me, I\xe2\x80\x99m a dragon,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cLook at me, I\xe2\x80\x99m a wizard,\xe2\x80\x9d the boy was always shouting. Cressen sees Renly\xe2\x80\x99s bid to be king as no more than another game: \xe2\x80\x9cLook at me, I\xe2\x80\x99m a king!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCressen asks Davos if he could bring Stannis any hope, but Davos insists that the only hope he could bring would have been the false sort. This leads Cressen to recall that Ser Davos was once a notorious smuggler who sailed a black ship past a [[House Redwyne|Redwyne]] blockade in the dead of night to deliver onions and salt fish to Stannis\xe2\x80\x99 starving garrison during the [[Siege of Storm\'s End]]. It allowed them to survive until Lord [[Eddard Stark]] could lift the siege. Stannis knighted Davos for his deed. However, as punishment for his past misdeeds, Stannis himself cut short all the fingers on Davos\xe2\x80\x99 left hand save the thumb; Davos had insisted that Stannis do the cutting. Cressen realizes that a man like that would give no false hope to Stannis. Ser Davos declares that if Stannis marches on [[King\'s Landing]] now, as is his intent, with so small an army it will only be to die. Cressen responds that Davos has done all he can and that it is now his turn. \n\n[[File:Dragonstone Chamber of the Painted Table by Kim Pope.jpg|thumb|370px|left|The Chamber of the Painted Table \xe2\x80\x93 by Kim Pope]]\n\nCressen finds Stannis in the top room of the keep, looking down at the [[Painted Table]], which is shaped as a detailed map of the continent of [[Westeros]]. Stannis greets him with the statement that he knew Cressen would come even without a summons. He says that Cressen is now old and needs his sleep, and that he would have learned what Davos knew on his own anyway. Talk between the maester and the king quickly turns into a rant by Stannis about how the [[House Baratheon|Baratheon]] birthright of Storm\xe2\x80\x99s End, the Stormlands, and its income should have passed to him rather than Renly when their brother [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] assumed the [[Iron Throne]]. Stannis did not want Dragonstone, but when his brother commanded it, he occupied it and built his brother\xe2\x80\x99s fleets. It is an old grievance made new by the fact that Dragonstone, ancient and strong though it is, commands the allegiance of only a handful of lesser lords whose stony island holdings are too thinly occupied to supply the men that Stannis needs to seize his rightful throne. \n\nCressen explains that Robert did him an injustice, but gave him lordship of Dragonstone because a man\xe2\x80\x99s strength was needed to hold it and Renly was just a boy. Stannis declares that Renly is \'\'still\'\' a boy, a thieving child who has never done anything to deserve the throne. Stannis wonders aloud why the gods inflicted him with brothers. Then he asks about the advice Renly gets from his maester, but Cressen doubts that Renly would seek council; Renly is bold and heedless, much like Robert.\n\nWhen Stannis asks what he is to tell the few anxious bannermen he does command, Maester Cressen reminds him that [[House Lannister]] is his true enemy and suggests that he join with Renly to defeat them. Stannis flatly refuses. Cressen yields immediately and suggests a partnership with the new [[King in the North]], [[Robb Stark]], who commands all the power of [[Winterfell]] and [[Riverrun]]. Stannis again refuses, claiming that Robb is a green boy and another false king that seeks to steal half of his kingdom. Cressen suggests that half a realm is better than none and that Robb may even submit in exchange for help in avenging his father, but Stannis remains adamant and launches into another rant about the slights he received at the hands of his brother Robert:\n\n{{Quote|\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I avenge Eddard Stark? The man was nothing to me. Oh, \'\'\'Robert\'\'\' loved him, to be sure. Loved him as a brother, how often did I hear that? I was his brother, not Ned Stark, but you would never have known by the way he treated me. I held [[Storm\'s End]] for him, watching good men starve while [[Mace Tyrell]] and [[Paxter Redwyne]] feasted within sight of my walls. Did Robert thank me? No. He thanked \'\'\'Stark\'\'\', for lifting the siege when we were down to rats and radishes. I built a fleet at Robert\xe2\x80\x99s command, took Dragonstone in his name. Did he ever take my hand and say, \'\'\'Well done, brother, whatever should I do without you?\'\'\' No, he blamed me for letting [[Willem Darry]] steal away [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]] and [[Daenerys Targaryen|the babe]], as if I could have stopped it. I sat on his council for fifteen years, helping [[Jon Arryn]] rule his realm while Robert drank and whored, but when Jon died, did my brother name me his [[Hand of the King|Hand]]? No, he went galloping off to his dear friend Ned Stark, and offered him the honor. And small good it did either of them.\xe2\x80\x9d}}\n\n[[File:Stannis by Giliberti.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Stannis Baratheon \xe2\x80\x93 by M.Luisa Giliberti\xc2\xa9]]\n\nCressen then proposes a marriage pact between Shireen and young [[Robert Arryn]]. Stannis dismisses the possibility of bringing the weak and sickly Robert to Dragonstone, as planned before Lord Arryn\xe2\x80\x99s death, because [[Lysa Arryn]] is paranoid and hides him in the [[Eyrie]]. Cressen urges him to send Shireen and her fool to the Eyrie instead\xe2\x80\x94Dragonstone is a grim home for a child. Stannis now agrees that it is worth a try.\n\nThen Stannis\xe2\x80\x99 wife, Queen [[Selyse Florent|Selyse]], arrives to argue that Stannis should not have to beg or bargain for help; they all owe their allegiance to him as the true king. Queen Selyse has been entirely converted to the worship of the foreign god [[R\'hllor]] by the red priestess [[Melisandre]] of [[Asshai]]. Stannis tells her he needs swords, and asks whether she has an army. She replies that [[House Florent]] can provide an army, but Stannis retorts that they can only provide 2,000 men, and are too close to [[Highgarden]]. The queen proclaims that the [[Red Comet|comet]] is an omen from the Lord of Light that He will aid Stannis in his conquest. Stannis, who does not share his wife\xe2\x80\x99s newfound faith, questions how many men the Red God will deliver him. Selyse insists that R\xe2\x80\x99hllor will provide all the power of [[Highgarden]] and [[Storm\'s End]]. Stannis reminds her that those men now support Renly. Selyse agrees, but suggests that if Renly should die, his army would join Stannis. She then notes that Melisandre has looked into the flames and seen Renly dead. Cressen is horrified by the notion and pleads that fratricide is evil. Stannis declares that he has heard Cressen\xe2\x80\x99s advice and will now hear hers, and sends the aged maester away.\n\nBy the time Cressen joins Pylos at the bottom of the steps, he can hardly stand erect, and needs to be helped back to his rooms. There, Cressen contemplates his options. He raised Robert, Stannis, and Renly after their father died, and cannot watch one kill the other. He knows that everything Queen Selyse said has been preached to her by Melisandre, the red priestess. It is she who must be silenced before she can convert King Stannis to her evil schemes and spread her mad religion beyond Dragonstone. \n\nTherefore, Cressen goes to a small workroom under the rookery stair and retrieves a small vial of purple crystals, a poison known in Westeros only as [[the Strangler]]. Dissolved in wine, one of the small crystals is enough to cause the victim\'s throat muscles to constrict more tightly than any fist, making it impossible for the victim to breathe. Cressen plans to put one in Lady Melisandre\xe2\x80\x99s drink at the feast Stannis is holding for his bannermen tonight. He knows it is a dreadful thing he is planning, but surely the gods will forgive him. As he lays down for a nap, Cressen wonders if the comet is his, foreboding murder.\n\n[[File:Melisandre by mrgotland.png|320px|thumb|Melisandre giving the poisoned cup to Maester Cressen by [http://mrgotland.deviantart.com/ mrgotland]\xc2\xa9]]\n\nHours later, Cressen wakes to discover he has overslept and is late for the feast. He calls for Pylos, who should have awoken him, but Pylos does not come, so he has to shout for the servants. As he crosses the long gallery, the comet outside the windows looks malevolent to him, but he thinks he should not fear. When he enters the great hall, he finds Stannis and his bannermen have begun without him. As Cressen crosses the room, Patchface the fool lurches into him while singing the same song from the morning and they both fall to the floor. Face-to-face with Cressen, the fool says \xe2\x80\x9cUnder the sea you fall up, I know, I know.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nCressen is too feeble to rise on his own, but fortunately strong hands lift him to his feet. When he turns to thank the knight he believes helped him, he comes face-to-face with Lady Melisandre herself, clothed in red silk with red eyes. The red priestess mockingly advises him to mind his steps, intoning her religion\'s prayer, \xe2\x80\x9cFor the night is dark and full of terrors.\xe2\x80\x9d Cressen insists that only children fear the dark. Melisandre gives him a riddle, \xe2\x80\x9cA clever fool and a foolish wise man\xe2\x80\x9d, and places Patchface\xe2\x80\x99s ridiculous antlered helm upon Cressen\xe2\x80\x99s head, telling him \xe2\x80\x9cA crown to match your chain, Lord Maester.\xe2\x80\x9d All around him, Cressen hears laughter. He removes the crown, fighting his rage. He tells her he needs no crown but truth, to which Melisandre replies that some truths are not taught in Old Town.\n\nWhen he reaches the high table, Cressen sees that Stannis has given his accustomed seat to Pylos. When questioned why he did not wake him, Pylos blushes and states he was told to let Cressen rest and that Cressen was not needed here. Cressen looks at the gaudy knights and captains: aged and sour Lord [[Ardrian Celtigar]], handsome Lord [[Monford Velaryon]], plump 14-year-old Lord [[Duram Bar Emmon]], homely Ser [[Axell Florent]], pious Lord [[Guncer Sunglass]], and the Lysene captain [[Salladhor Saan]]. Only Ser Davos Seaworth is simply dressed. Melisandre sits to Stannis\xe2\x80\x99 right, in the place of high honor. Of all the lords, only Davos will meet his gaze, with pity in his eyes. \n\nStannis declares that Pylos will now assume all of Cressen\'s duties, insisting that Cressen is too ill and confused to be of use to him any longer. Cressen cannot believe it is Stannis\xe2\x80\x99s voice that states this. Cressen is heartbroken by the rejection, remembering how he was the one that loved Stannis as a boy, perhaps because Stannis was the one who was unloved. Cressen accepts and meekly pleads for some place at the table, though he still feels he belongs at Stannis\xe2\x80\x99 side. Of all the assembled lords, only Ser Davos offers him a seat.\n\nAs Patchface continues to caper about, Ser Davos comments that they should wear motley, since they are about fool\xe2\x80\x99s business: Melisandre has seen victory in her flames and so Stannis plans to press his claim, no matter the numbers. Cressen urges Stannis a final time to ally himself with Robb Stark or Lysa Arryn, but Queen Selyse insists that R\xe2\x80\x99hllor is the only ally Stannis needs. Cressen replies that gods make uncertain allies, and here R\'hllor has no power. Melisandre tells him that if he believes that he should put Patchface\xe2\x80\x99s crown back on, and Queen Selyse commands thus. Stannis grudgingly orders the fool to give the crown to Cressen. After the fool places the crown on Cressen\xe2\x80\x99s head, Selyse suggests that Cressen sing. Stannis refuses and declares that Cressen has served him well.\n\nSuddenly, Cressen sees the opportunity to poison Melisandre. He is close to Davos\xe2\x80\x99 cup, which he takes and slips a crystal into. He is sure only Davos notices. Cressen proposes to Melisandre that they share a cup of wine to toast to her god\xe2\x80\x99s power. She agrees. Davos tries to stop him, but Cressen insists he is doing what he must for the sake of the realm and his lord\xe2\x80\x99s soul. Before they drink, Melisandre gives him the opportunity to back out, but Cressen refuses. Melisandre drinks most of the cup, leaving only a small amount for Cressen. Cressen pushes away his fear and drinks as well. The ruby at Melisandre\xe2\x80\x99s throat glows as she insists that her god R\xe2\x80\x99hllor does have power. Cressen tries to reply, but his throat has already begun to constrict. Unaffected by the poison, Melisandre looks on with pity as Cressen collapses and dies.\n\n==References and Notes==\n* [http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2010/01/prologue-arya.html Humorous review of the chapter]\n* [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2011/02/re-read-clash-of-kings-prologue-part-ii.html Review of the 2nd part of the chapter in the course of a 10th reread]\n* [http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/01/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-1 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 00]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV miscellaneous|A Clash of Kings: Prologue]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Dragonstone]]\n\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Pr\xc3\xb3logo]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 01, Pr\xc3\xa9lude]][[zh:&amp;#21015;&amp;#29579;&amp;#30340;&amp;#32439;&amp;#20105;-&amp;#24207;&amp;#31456;]]</text>\n      <sha1>fbiwurxkpzlltcxbkhj0jxzdhfcg0as</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 78</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6258</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>183783</id>\n      <parentid>122068</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-05-08T21:18:17Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3804">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Samwell Tarly|Samwell]]\n| title\t\t= Samwell V\n| place         = [[Castle Black]]\n| page\t\t= 881\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 77|Tyrion XI]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 78|Samwell V]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 79|Jon XII]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 75|Samwell IV]]\n| arc next\t=\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==    \nKing [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] has brought several of the [[Night\'s Watch|black brothers]] before him to make known his anger about them taking too long to select a new Lord Commander. Stannis sees through [[Janos Slynt]]\xe2\x80\x99s fawning, having known the man as a bribe-taker in [[King\'s Landing]]. The king makes it clear that after they finally vote in a new Lord Commander, he plans to take all the castles along [[the Wall]], except for the three currently occupied by the [[Night\'s Watch|Watch]], to garrison his forces. He also plans to either take or be granted the [[Gift]], stating that he intends to help the Watch guard the Wall. He commands the builders to deliver reports on the conditions of the abandoned castles, and informs the men gathered that nightfires will be lit before the gates of all the castles. When [[Melisandre]] mentions the impending war, Maester [[Aemon Targaryen (son of Maekar I)|Aemon]] is aware that she speaks of the prophesied War for the Dawn. After the others have left, Aemon asks to see the fabled sword [[Lightbringer]] through Sam\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. [[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] describes the sword as glowing, yet there are no flames.\n\nStannis questions Sam about [[dragonglass]], making it known that there are great deposits of obsidian beneath [[Dragonstone]], and that he intends to have it mined and brought to the Wall. The king asks Sam to show him the [[Nightfort#Black Gate|Black Gate]], as he intends to make the [[Nightfort]] his seat, and Sam agrees although he is not sure if the gate will open for a man not of the black. When they leave, Maester Aemon asks Sam if he felt any heat emanating from the sword, and he realizes that he did not. Aemon speaks of the choosing, subtly implying that Sam could do something to help speed the process. Determined to put aside the bickering between the two leading candidates, Sam speaks with both [[Cotter Pyke]] and Ser [[Denys Mallister]] individually. Both are aware they will not be elected and agree that Slynt would be a bad choice. So Sam asks them if they would step aside if the right candidate were to be named. Playing one off the other, using their dislike for each other, Sam sets it up so that each man will lend his support to [[Jon Snow|Jon]] that night.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Stannis Baratheon]]\n*[[Janos Slynt]]\n*[[Melisandre]]\n*[[Aemon Targaryen (son of Maekar I)]]\n*[[Samwell Tarly]]\n*[[Cotter Pyke]]\n*[[Denys Mallister]]\n*[[Jon Snow]]\n}}\t\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Night\'s Watch]]\n*[[King\'s Landing]]\n*[[The Wall]]\n*[[Gift]]\n*[[Lightbringer]]\n*[[Dragonglass]]\n*[[Dragonstone]]\n*[[Nightfort#Black Gate|Black Gate]]\n*[[Nightfort]]\n}}\n\n\n==References and Notes==\n*The synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html]    \n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/11/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-51 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Part 51].

They have been long isolated from supplies, apparently forgotten by [[Victarion Greyjoy|Victarion]] who brought them there before leaving for the [[Kingsmoot]].  The North\'s [[crannogmen]] keep them under constant siege and their morale is so low that they no longer bother to even dispose of their dead.  \n\nTheir nominal leader [[Ralf Kenning]]&lt;ref&gt;We learned in [[A Feast for Crows]], [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 18|Chapter 18]] (The Iron Captain) that Kenning was left in charge by [[Victarion Greyjoy]]&lt;/ref&gt; is only barely alive, suffering a painful, slow, ugly death after being infected by a poisoned arrow.  Theon, torn between his conditioning to think of himself as Ramsay\'s plaything Reek and his orders to present himself as Lord Balon Greyjoy\'s son, has glimpses of his past pride and identity and actually mercy kills Ralf Kenning before making demands of the mostly [[House Codd|Codd]] men that still survive in the garrison.\n\n[[Dagon Codd]] attempts to refuse his terms, but [[Adrack Humble]] kills him.  The Ironborn surrender to Ramsay Bolton and hear empty promises of food and peace before being mercilessly killed and displayed at stakes along the road.\n\nTheon, still thinking of himself as Reek, is further humiliated by Ramsay and &quot;rewarded&quot; by being &quot;promoted&quot; to the role of a dog.  He meets Lord [[Roose Bolton]] as his own forces arrive at Moat Cailin with a sizeable number of [[House Frey|Frey]] men, including [[Hosteen Frey]] and [[Aenys Frey]], both of whom Theon recognizes from his time at their side as part of [[Robb Stark|Robb]]\'s war campaign.  At this point only about a fifth of the Northmen who went south with Robb Stark have returned alive.  \n\nTheon recognizes the newly arrived bride of Ramsay as an impostor; she is not [[Arya Stark]] as claimed, but rather [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]]\'s friend [[Jeyne Poole]].&lt;ref&gt;The events of this Chapter seem to happen during or shortly after those of [[A Feast for Crows]], [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 17|Chapter 17]] (Cersei IV), where Cersei\'s small council discusses the taking of Moat Cailin and Jeyne/&quot;Arya&quot;\'s travel to the North to marry Ramsay.

[[Craster]] has been an ally to the Watch, but he has an unsavory reputation. [[Jon Snow]] discovers that Craster marries his daughters and gives his young sons to the Cold Gods. Jon gets the opportunity to talk to one of Craster\xe2\x80\x99s wives, [[Gilly]], about this, and learns that the Cold Gods have bright blue eyes like the [[Others#wights|wights]] that attacked [[Jeor Mormont]]. The next day, Jon rides with the Lord Commander, telling him about Craster\xe2\x80\x99s sons and daughters, and learns that the commander knew. Then the commander tells him that Craster informed them that [[Mance Rayder]] is gathering his people at [[Frostfangs]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Jon Snow]] is riding beside a grumpy [[Jeor Mormont|Lord Commander]] with an equally soaked and grumpy raven on his shoulder. There have been six days of rain, and the ground is treacherous; Jon thinks about [[Pypar]] and [[Todder]] sitting near the fire in the common room. The Lord Commander is relieved when he hears [[Jarmen Buckwell]]\xe2\x80\x99s horn\xe2\x80\x94it means there are still people at [[Craster\'s Keep]]. They have so far passed through seven villages without seeing anybody. Jon has heard many tales about [[Craster]]. [[Thoren Smallwood]] swears he is a friend of the watch, though he has an unsavory reputation: [[Dywen]] says he is a kinslayer, liar, raper, craven, and slaver. The Lord Commander tells Jon to spread the word down the column that he wants no trouble with Craster\xe2\x80\x99s women, and the men will mind their hands and avoid talking to the women.\n\nAs he rides down the line, he finally comes to [[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] with the baggage. The ravens are very unruly, and Sam explains that they hate the rain like men. Sam states he is doing alright, but wet, and when he is told that Craster\xe2\x80\x99s Keep is just ahead, he tells Jon that [[Eddison Tollett]] says Craster marries his daughters, only follows his own laws, and that Dywen told [[Grenn]] he has black blood. Also, that his mother is [[free folk|a wilding]] that laid with a ranger. Sam almost goes on to call Craster a bastard, but Jon finishes for him, and says he has heard the word before. Jon finally makes it to the rear to give word to Ser [[Ottyn Wythers]], who considers it welcome news; he has always looked tired, but the rain has made him look much worse. \n\nOn the way back up the column, Jon cuts through the woods. When he hears rustling, he thinks it is [[Ghost]], but it is Dywen and Grenn. Jon gives them the news that Craster is alive, and discussion turns to how many wives he has. Then Ghost is loping beside Jon\xe2\x80\x99s horse. Jon rides ahead to the keep.\n\nWhen he gets to the keep, he is very disappointed. He did not expect a stone castle, but what he finds, he would call a midden heap. Inside the compound he sees a little naked girl pulling carrots, and two women tie a pig for slaughter. He can hear [[Chett]]\xe2\x80\x99s hounds\' barking being answered by the bark of Craster\xe2\x80\x99s dogs. Some of the dogs break off when they see Ghost, while others growl and Ghost ignores them. Jon estimates that only 30 or maybe 50 will get to sleep in the hall, but not their 200. Dolorous Edd has been entrusted with the commander\xe2\x80\x99s mount and tells Jon that he is to join the commander in the hall, but the wolf should stay outside.\n\nInside the squalid, foul smelling hall, there are already two dozen rangers, including Jarman Buckwell and Thoren Smallwood. Jon thinks how he looked forward to seeing the wonders beyond the wall\xe2\x80\x94it is a pity Pypar and Todder are missing this. Craster is the only one sitting in a chair, even the commander has to sit on a bench, and seeing him Jon thinks of Old [[Nan]]\xe2\x80\x99s tales of wildlings drinking blood from human skulls. He overhears Craster say he has not seen [[Brandon Stark]] for three years. In the background, shabbily dressed women prepare the food and pass out beer while a dozen puppies and a pig skulk around. Mormont tells Crater that Ben was searching for the vanished Ser [[Waymar Royce]], [[Gared]] and [[Will]]. Craster recalls the three men, but does not know where they went. He does complain that his wives made cow eyes at young Ser Waymar who was too proud to sleep under his roof. The commander tells him about the villages they found abandoned, and the [[Others#wights|wights]] that attacked him at [[Castle Black]]. Craster feigns ignorance, but one of his wives recognizes the truth in the tale by the look of horror on her face. Craster also refuses the offer of an escort back to [[The Wall|the Wall]], saying he is of the free folk. He even has his wife confirm that this is their place, Craster keeps them safe, and it is better to die free. Jarmen Buckwell asks about Craster\xe2\x80\x99s king, [[Mance Rayder]], and Craster states that Free Folk have no need of kings, and that when one of Mance\xe2\x80\x99s men arrived to tell him he had to leave his keep and grovel at Mance\xe2\x80\x99s feet, he sent the man back without his tongue. \n\nCraster then tells the commander that they can sleep on the floor, but he will only feed 20. Mormont responds that the roof would be welcome, and they have food and wine which they will share. Craster expresses particular interest in the wine and then adds that any man that lays a hand on one of his wives loses his hand. Mormont agrees, but does not look pleased. Craster now asks if Mormont has a man that can draw maps, and Jon steps forward stating that Sam likes maps. Mormont tells Jon to get Sam with quill and parchment and bring  Mormont\xe2\x80\x99s axe as a guest gift. Craster notes that Jon Snow has the look of a Stark, and is told that he is Mormont\xe2\x80\x99s steward and squire. When Craster hears the name Snow, he understands that Jon is a bastard, and declares that a man who wants to bed a woman should marry her like he does, and then tells Jon to do his service.\n\nJon almost collides into Ottyn Wythers as he is leaving. Outside he finds tents have gone up all over the compound. He finds Dolorous Edd and tells him of the requests. Edd states that the commander will get his axe back, buried in his skull. When he hears that the commander wants wine as well, he says that Craster, drunk, will only cut off an ear when he attempts to slay them. When Jon tells Dolorous Edd that Smallwood says Craster is their friend, he responds the difference between wildling friends and enemies is that the friends bury them in secret graves.\n\nJon hears a shout of fear as he finishes up feeding the horses. He finds Ghost with two rabbits confronting a 15 year old girl. Jon promises that Ghost will not hurt her. He asks her if she is one of Craster\xe2\x80\x99s daughters and is told she is now his wife. She was hoping to breed the rabbits. Jon can tell that Ghost has gone after the caged rabbits; he must have been hungry. He would pay for them but has no money, so he tells her that the [[Night\'s Watch]] will make good. She calls him lord and he responds he is no lord. Then ranger [[Lark]] the Sisterman tells her that he is Lord Snow himself, and then notes that the wolf is looking hungry. Jon tells Lark that he is scaring her, only to have Chett respond that Lark is warning her. The girl then remembers she is not to talk to them. Chett tells Jon that he would not be so bold without Ghost around; Chett lost is position as Maester [[Aemon]]\xe2\x80\x99s steward because of Jon. When Lark joins in about Jon being a coward without his wolf, he leaves.\n\nIt takes a while for Jon to find Sam, and it is actually Ghost that finds him under a rock outcrop. Ghost has given Jon the second rabbit, and Jon shows Sam and then informs him that the commander wants him to create a map. Jon proceeds to cook the scrawny rabbit over a fire. It smells wonderful and the other rangers give them envious looks. As they eat, Sam asks if Craster is a savage, as they say. After Sam leaves with the quill and parchment, Jon falls asleep thinking that maybe the commander will learn something that will lead them to Uncle Benjen. \n\nHe wakes to dawn, and Ghost is gone. Everything is coated in a fine ice glaze, and Jon thinks of his sisters, and that Sansa would call this enchantment. He hears his name called and finds the girl with the rabbits wearing Sam\xe2\x80\x99s cloak. She asks him if he is the king\xe2\x80\x99s brother, and he tells her he is his half-brother. Jon is concerned about Craster, but [[Gilly]] tells him her father drank too much and will sleep most of the day. She then asks him about King\xe2\x80\x99s justice; she wants to leave. Craster should not even notice since he has 19 wives. She explains that she is pregnant, and while it will not be too bad if she has a girl, since Craster will let her grow up and marry her, if it is boy, he will give it to the gods. Nella has told her that the baby will be male, and Gilly believes she knows these things, having had six boys. She continues by telling Jon that when the white cold comes, he sacrifices the boys, and it has been coming more often, so he has had to give the sheep, which are now gone. Next it will be the dogs. The Cold Gods come at night, and are white shadows. Jon thinks about the two wights, asks the color of their eyes and is told they are bright blue. She tells him that she knows he did not take of Craster\xe2\x80\x99s hospitality, so Jon is not bound to Craster, and asks to be taken to the Wall, but Jon tells her that they are going the other direction, and that it is for the old crow to decide, not him. Disappointed, she leaves.\n\nHe joins Dywen, Grenn and Hake for breakfast. Dywen claims he had three of the woman that night. He is not believed. Jon asks if Sam slept in the hall, and is told that it was impossible to sleep with the hard ground, the ill-smelling rushes, and the snoring, particularly the snoring of [[Brown Bernarr]]. Jon soon excuses himself to attend to the Lord Commander.\n\nOn the way, he passes by the scouts, and Jarman Buckwell tells him to keep a good edge on his sword since they will be needing it soon enough. When he enters the hall, the commander\xe2\x80\x99s Raven announces his presence with a request for corn. When the commander asks, Jon tells him the rain has stopped but it is cold. Mormont tells him to saddle his horse for he plans to leave within the hour. He tells Jon that there is some food, but Jon declines, deciding he will not take of Craster\xe2\x80\x99s hospitality.\n\nHe finds Sam behind the hall with Gilly. She quietly leaves and Sam tells Jon he was hoping he could do something for Gilly. Jon asks what he could have done, wrap her in a cloak and take her with them? Sam admits Jon is right, but she is afraid, and maybe when they come back they can take her. Jon states the commander will not let them take one of Craster\xe2\x80\x99s wives, then quickly excuses himself because he has to groom and saddle the horses.\n\nAs he rides alongside Mormont, Jon notes that Craster has no sons or sheep. Mormont admits that Craster gives his sons to the wood, and tells Jon that all the rangers know, but will not talk of it. If he could have, Mormont states, he would have taken the boys, they could raise them to the black, but the wildlings serve crueler gods. Mormont then asks if Jon spoke to one of Craster\xe2\x80\x99s wives, and Jon admits he did. Then Mormont tells Jon that if he had his way, with Craster sprawled out drunk and the new axe below, one of the wives could easily kill him. However, the Night\'s Watch need Craster, and his keep has been responsible for saving many ranger lives. Mormont can tell Jon wants to say something, and tells him to. Jon states that his father said that a brutal or unjust bannerman shames his liege lord. Mormont responds that Craster is his own man and has sworn no vows.\n\nAfter Jon informs Mormont that Buckwell has told him he would soon need his sword, Mormont explains that Craster told them Mance Rayder is gathering his people at [[Frostfangs]], a cruel, inhospitable wilderness of stone and ice. Mormont expects Mance to invade the realm. Jon mentions that [[Raymun Redbeard]] in the time of his grandfather\'s grandfather, and before that [[Bael the Bard]], invaded the realm. Mormont admits this, adding more names including [[Joramun]], who blew the Horn of Winter to wake the giants, but not only is the Watch  a shadow of itself, Winterfell is weak with [[Robb Stark]] marching south. This is a great opportunity for the wildlings. Their only choice is to find Mance Rayder and stop him.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n*Analyses and summary of the chapter [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2011/10/re-read-jon-iii-procrasterination.html in the course of a 10th reread] by Slynt. \n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/03/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-11 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 23]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Jon Snow]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at Craster\'s Keep]]\n\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 23]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 24, Jon]]</text>\n      <sha1>4nc513lht3vnunopnwdifnux8p22dlf</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Game of Thrones-Chapter 26</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5988</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>165969</id>\n      <parentid>158812</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-17T14:15:31Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8963">{{Infobox Chapter AGoT\n| pov\t\t= [[Jon Snow]]\n| place         = [[Castle Black]]\n| title\t\t= Jon IV\n| page\t\t= 218 (US bantam HC)\n| previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 25|Eddard V]]\n| current\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 26|Jon IV]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 27|Eddard VI]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 19|Jon III]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 41|Jon V]]\n}} __NOTOC__\n\t\n[[Samwell Tarly]] appears in the yard while [[Jon Snow|Jon]] is training the other recruits. When Ser [[Alliser Thorne]] orders Sam beaten after he yields, Jon and his friends aid the new recruit. Later Jon talks with Sam and, afterwards, convinces the other recruits to go easy on Sam, despite Thorne\xe2\x80\x99s commands.\n\n==Synopsis== \n\n[[Jon Snow|Jon]] is helping the other recruits with their swordsmanship when [[Samwell Tarly]], the fattest boy he has ever seen, enters the yard. Sam nervously explains he has been told to come there for training, and [[Pypar|Pyp]] identifies him by his voice as a lordling from near [[Highgarden]]. Sam is immediately ridiculed by Ser [[Alliser Thorne]], who says they are now sending pigs to man [[the Wall]]. Although Sam has brought his own armor, none of it is black so he has to be reequipped, which requires some ingenuity by the armorer. \n\nWhen Sam returns, Ser Alliser sends [[Halder]], a very strong boy, against him. In under a minute Sam is on the ground with a broken helm, screaming that he yields. When Sam refuses to stand up, Thorne tells Halder to hit him with the flat of the blade until he gets up. The initial hit is tentative, but Thorne insists that Halder can hit harder and the next blow splits leather. Jon\xe2\x80\x99s objections are initially stopped by Pyp, but after another blow Jon shakes him off and states there is no honor in beating a beaten foe. \n\nJon helps Sam up, which Ser Alliser mocks as \xe2\x80\x9cdefending his lady love.\xe2\x80\x9d Declaring it a training exercise, Thorne sends Halder, [[Rast]], and [[Albett]] to get past Jon to beat Sam. Jon braces himself for a hard fight; Ser Alliser has sent two boys against him before, but never three. To Jon\xe2\x80\x99s surprise, Pyp and [[Grenn]] come to his aid. The boys going against Jon hesitate, but Jon attacks. Jon soon takes out Halder, but not before taking a damaging blow to his shoulder. Then he helps Pyp take down Rast. Once Rast is down, Albett yields and Ser Alliser leaves in a fury.\n\nHalder wrenches off his helmet and throws it across the yard, declaring that he thought he had Jon. Jon admits that he almost did. When Jon attempts to remove his helmet, his shoulder is painful. Sam, his head bloody where his helmet had been split, comes over and helps Jon remove the helmet gently. Sam introduces himself and Jon introduces himself, Grenn, and Pyp; Sam thanks them all. When asked why he did not fight back, Sam states that couldn\xe2\x80\x99t because he is a coward. Jon and his friends are speechless\xe2\x80\x94who would admit that he was coward? Seeing the response of Jon and his friends, Sam apologizes to them, stating he does not like being a coward. As Sam leaves for the armory, Jon tells him tomorrow he will do better, but Sam insists that he will not.\n\nAfter Sam leaves, Grenn states nobody likes cowards, and is worried what others will think if they are associated with a coward. Pyp\xe2\x80\x99s response is that if Grenn met a bear in the woods he would be too stupid to run away. Grenn insists he would run faster than Pyp, then attacks Pyp when he realizes the trick.\n\nFor the recruits, mornings are for swordplay and afternoons for other work, which is varied so that the Watch can measure a recruit\xe2\x80\x99s skills. That afternoon Jon is to spread gravel on top of the wall by himself. This gives him a chance to contemplate Sam. He thinks about [[Tyrion Lannister]]\xe2\x80\x99s statement about denying a hard truth and realizes that Sam\xe2\x80\x99s admission of cowardice took a certain kind of courage. \n\nWhen he enters the common hall where dinner is almost done, Jon passes his friends and joins Sam, who is sitting by himself. After introducing [[Ghost]] and some polite conversation, Jon asks Sam to join him outside to talk. As they walk, Sam admits that he did not think the [[Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch]] would be like this; all the buildings are falling down, and it is so cold. Jon suggests it must have been warmer where Sam lived, and Sam explains that he had never seen snow until a month ago.\n\nJon leads Sam to [[the Wall]], but Sam balks at climbing the great wooden stairs. Jon replies that there is a winch, but Sam states he does not like heights. When Jon asks why a boy who is afraid of everything would join the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch, Sam starts to cry until Ghost licks his face, which makes them both laugh. They continue talking and before long Jon starts talking about [[Winterfell]]. Jon reveals a dream he\xe2\x80\x99s been having of returning to Winterfell to find it completely empty. As he is telling about the dream, Jon thinks about how several rangings have been made to find [[Benjen Stark]], whose trail just disappears. In his dream, Jon always finds himself descending the stairs to the crypt in dark, and it is then that he wakes up. \n\nJon asks if Sam ever dreams of [[Horn Hill]]. Sam insists that he does not, and that he hated it there. After a long silence, Sam tells the story of why he was sent to the Wall. His father, Lord [[Randyll Tarly]], was disgusted that his eldest son was so plump, soft, awkward, and squeamish. Sam\xe2\x80\x99s interest in music, books, dancing, and soft clothes only made matters worse. Many masters-at-arms were brought to Horn Hill to try to make Sam into the type of many his father wanted. When a second son, [[Dickon Tarly|Dickon]] was finally born, Lord Randyll had given up on Sam. On his 15th name day, Sam says, he was escorted to his father in a wood, where he was informed that he was to forsake his claim to Horn Hill and join the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch, or else his father would arrange an accident. Jon finds it strange that Sam tells the story in such a detached voice and does not weep even once. Jon tells Sam about some of the other recruits, and Sam eventually states he should get some sleep and plods off. \n\nJon returns to the common room. His friends explain that they did not shun Sam; there were places on the bench but Sam was such a craven that he just passed them by. Jon persuades them all to not beat Sam anymore, whatever Ser Alliser says. [[Rast]], however, insists that if Thorne sends him against \xe2\x80\x9cLady Piggy,\xe2\x80\x9d he will cut off a rasher of bacon, and laughs in Jon\xe2\x80\x99s face. That night, Jon\xe2\x80\x94with Pyp, Grenn, and Ghost\xe2\x80\x94visits Rast in his cell. With Ghost\xe2\x80\x99s mouth around Rast\'s throat, Jon tells Rast that they know where he sleeps. \n\nAfter that, no matter what Ser Alliser does, he cannot get any of the recruits to do anything but tap Sam when they are put up against him. Sam later thanks Jon and calls him his first friend; Jon responds that they are not friends but brothers. Jon now realizes that [[Robb Stark|Robb]], [[Bran Stark|Bran]] and [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]] are his father\xe2\x80\x99s sons, but that he has never been one of them; his true brothers are the outcasts of the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch. He realizes his uncle was right, and wonders if he will ever see Benjen again to tell him.\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Jon Snow]]\n*[[Samwell Tarly]]\n*[[Alliser Thorne]]\n*[[Halder]]\n*[[Pypar|Pyp]]\n*[[Grenn]]\n*[[Ghost]]\n*[[Rast]]\n*[[Dareon]]\n*[[Albett]]\n*[[Todder]]\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Benjen Stark]]\n*[[Randyll Tarly]]\n*[[Dickon Tarly]]\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Bran Stark]]\n*[[Rickon Stark]]\n*[[Arya Stark]]\n*[[Donal Noye]]\n* Ser [[Jaremy Rykker]]\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Qhorin Halfhand]]\n*[[Mace Tyrell]]\n*Maester [[Aemon]]\n*[[Catelyn Stark]]\n|}\t\n\n==Terms and places mentioned==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[The Wall]]\n*[[Winterfell]]\n*[[Horn Hill]]\n*[[Highgarden]]\n*[[Barrowlands]]\n*[[Shadow Tower]]\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch]]\n*[[Warden of the South]]\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Items:\'\'\'\n*[[Heartsbane]]\n|}\n\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/07/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-14 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/027/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==\t\n*The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\t\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 26]]\t\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Jon Snow]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Castle Black]]\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 26]]\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 27, Jon]]\n[[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\x94\xd0\xb6\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbd IV]]</text>\n      <sha1>m7v5lo9xek7fxue2o4w0qh6yt3rqev4</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Clash of Kings-Chapter 48</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6217</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>192340</id>\n      <parentid>166452</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-08-25T16:15:27Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8319">{{Infobox Chapter ACfK\n| pov\t\t= [[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n| place         = [[Qarth]]\n| title\t\t= Daenerys IV\n| page\t\t= 508\n| previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 47|Arya IX]]\n| current\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 48|Daenerys IV]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 49|Tyrion XI]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 40|Daenerys III]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 63|Daenerys V]]\n}}\n\n[[File: House_of_Dust_MarcSimonetti.jpg\xe2\x80\x8e |[[Daenerys Targaryen]] being attacked by the Undying Ones - by Marc Simonetti \xc2\xa9|thumb|350px|right]]\n\n[[Daenerys Targaryen]] enters the [[House of the Undying]], where she experiences many visions. She reaches the audience chamber of the Undying Ones, who give her cryptic information and then try to consume her. [[Drogon]] rescues her and she runs outside, where [[Pyat Pree]] tries to attack her, but Drogon comes to her help once again.\n\n==Synopsis==\nDaenerys stands before the [[House of the Undying]]. [[Drogon]] hisses at the gray and ancient ruin and most of her companions, Ser [[Jorah Mormont|Jorah]], [[Jhogo]], [[Aggo]], and [[Xaro Xhoan Daxos|Xaro]], tell her she should turn back, but she is resolute to enter the abode of the Warlocks. [[Pyat Pree]] steps out to her, saying that Daenerys must enter alone, or not at all. He leads her to the entrance, warning her to always take the door to her right, and only take stairs leading up. On her way she will see visions of the past, future and days that never were, and those that will speak to her from other rooms, but she must not enter any room and keep her path until she reaches the Undying\'s audience chamber. \n\nAt the entrance, Daenerys drinks a glass of [[shade of the evening]] a dwarf gives her, to prepare her for the truths within, and enters. In the House of the Undying, she notices right away that she is in the presence of sorcery. Fortunately, she brought [[Drogon]] with her into the Warlocks\' home. Daenerys sees a great many visions during her journey through the halls:\n\n# A beautiful naked woman sprawling on a floor with four little men with rat-like faces raping her.\n# A feast of corpses, a room full of savagely slaughtered bodies, and many of the corpses have cups or spoons in their hands; above them sits a dead man on a throne with the head of a wolf, wearing an iron crown and holding a leg of lamb like a king would hold a scepter;&lt;ref&gt;Spoiler: a reference to the [[Red Wedding]]&lt;/ref&gt;\n# old, dead, loyal Ser [[Willem Darry]] beckons her into the house with the [[red door]], in [[Braavos]]&lt;ref&gt;The place where Daenerys grew up&lt;/ref&gt; \n# An old man with long silver hair sits on a barbed throne in a great hall with dragon skulls, and says &quot;Let him be the king of ashes&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;Spoiler: King [[Aerys II Targaryen]] ordering the destruction of King\'s Landing, during the [[Sack of King\'s Landing]]&lt;/ref&gt;\n# a [[Rhaegar Targaryen|man]] who looks like [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]], but taller and with darker eyes, who says to a [[Elia Martell|woman]] nursing a baby, &quot;[[Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaegar)|Aegon]]\xe2\x80\xa6 What better name for a King\xe2\x80\xa6 He is the Prince that was Promised, and his is the song of ice and fire&quot;; and when the man\xe2\x80\x99s eyes meet Dany\xe2\x80\x99s, he says either to her or the woman with the baby, &quot;There must be one more\xe2\x80\xa6 The dragon has three heads&quot;, and he picks up a silver harp and begins to play;\n# a vision of Pyat Pree telling her the visit is over, and to follow him into a garden;\n# a great hall with several robed people claiming to be the Undying [[Qarth]], who tell her, &quot;We sent the comet to show you the way (to Qarth)\xe2\x80\xa6 shall we teach you the secret speech of dragonkind?&quot;, but it turns out to be sorcery.\n\nFinally, Daenerys comes upon a room with several figures that are no more than shadows, unbreathing, and over them floats a human heart, blue and corrupted (these are apparently the real Undying). The figures speak inside Dany\xe2\x80\x99s head:\n{{Quote|we know\xe2\x80\xa6 the shape of shadows\xe2\x80\xa6 morrows not yet made\xe2\x80\xa6 drink from the cup of ice\xe2\x80\xa6 drink from the cup of fire\xe2\x80\xa6 Mother of Dragons\xe2\x80\xa6 Child of Three\xe2\x80\xa6 three heads has the dragon\xe2\x80\xa6 three fires must you light: one for life and one for death and one to love\xe2\x80\xa6 three mounts must you ride: one to bed and one to dread and one to love\xe2\x80\xa6 three treasons will you know: once for blood and once for gold and once for love\xe2\x80\xa6 daughter of death, slayer of lies, bride of fire\xe2\x80\xa6}}\n\nShe now sees visions in her head, floating faster and faster:\n\n# [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]] dying;\n# a tall lord with copper skin and silver hair bearing the banner of a fiery stallion;&lt;ref&gt;Probably [[Rhaego]], her unborn son&lt;/ref&gt;\n# a dying prince with rubies flying from his armor whispering the name of a woman with his last breath;&lt;ref&gt;A vision of the death of [[Rhaegar Targaryen]]; the woman could be [[Lyanna Stark]]&lt;/ref&gt;\n# a blue-eyed king with a red sword in his hand who casts no shadow;&lt;ref&gt;This may be [[Stannis Baratheon]] with [[Lightbringer]]&lt;/ref&gt;\n# a cloth dragon amidst a cheering crowd;\n# a great stone beast flying from a smoking tower, breathing shadow fire;\n# her Silver horse given to her by [[Drogo]] at her wedding;\n# a corpse at the prow of a ship, eyes bright in his dead face, smiling sadly;&lt;ref&gt;Possibly a reference to [[Jon Connington]]&lt;/ref&gt;\n# a blue flower growing from a chink in a wall of ice;\n# shadows dancing in a tent;\n# a little girl running toward a house with a red door;{{Ref|aSoS|52}}\n# [[Mirri Maz Duur]] shrieking in the flames as a dragon bursts from her;\n# a corpse being dragged behind a silver horse;\n# a white lion running through grass taller than a man;\n# a line of naked crones emerging from a lake, kneeling before Daenerys beneath the [[Mother of Mountains]];\n# ten thousand slaves crying &quot;Mother&quot; as Daenerys rides by on her silver.&lt;ref&gt;A reference to the [[Battle of Yunkai]]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAt this point, the visions turn to a nightmare as the Undying try to consume Dany, and she is helpless to stop them until Drogon starts to tear the corrupted heart to pieces. Fleeing from the burning House of the Undying, Pyat Pree attacks her with a dagger, but Drogon interrupts him long enough for Daenerys to hear [[Jhogo]]\xe2\x80\x99s whip crack, and then she is in the arms of Ser [[Jorah Mormont|Jorah]].\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n*[[Drogon]]\n*[[Jhogo]]\n*[[Jorah Mormont]]\n*[[Xaro Xhoan Daxos]]\n*[[Aggo]]\n*[[Pyat Pree]]\n*[[Willem Darry]] (in vision)\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Aerys II Targaryen]] (in vision)\n*[[Rhaegar Targaryen]] (in vision)\n*[[Elia Martell]] (in vision]]\n*[[Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaegar)]] (in vision)\n*[[Viserys Targaryen]] (in vision)\n*[[The Silver]] (in vision)\n*[[Mirri Maz Duur]] (in vision)\n*[[Rakharo]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Drogo|Khal Drogo]]\n|}\n\n==Place and Terms Mentioned==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[House of the Undying]]/[[House of the Undying|Palace of Dust]]\n*[[Qarth]]\n*[[Chamber of the Undying]]\n*[[Braavos]]\n*[[Seven Kingdoms]]\n*[[Westeros]]\n*[[Mother of Mountains]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[Dragon]]\n*[[Dothraki]]\n*[[Warlock]]\n*\'\'[[arakh]]\'\'\n*\'\'[[khaleesi]]\'\'\n*\'\'[[khal]]\'\'\n*[[Shade of the evening]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[Undying Ones]]\n*[[Warrior (the Seven)|Warrior]]\n*[[Red Comet]]\n*[[House Targaryen]]\n|}\n\n==Notes and References==\n{{References}}\n* The synopsis was initially copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n\n==External Links==\n* [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2012/01/re-read-daenerys-iv-bewilderment-and.html Analyses and summary of the chapter] in the course of a 10th reread by Slynt.\n* [http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/06/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-23 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n* See the [[Dreams and prophecies]] article for a more detailed analysis of Daenerys visions in this chapter.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 48]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Daenerys Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Qarth]]\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 48]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 49, Daenerys]]</text>\n      <sha1>hnfshewpsxxiiuhw3dqth6m8tz1mxb3</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Game of Thrones-Chapter 11</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>3437</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>181027</id>\n      <parentid>165954</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-02-16T19:48:42Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7476">{{Infobox Chapter AGoT\n| pov\t\t= [[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n| place         = Outside the walls of [[Pentos]]\n| title\t\t= Daenerys II\n| page\t\t= \n| previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 10|Jon II]]\n| current\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 11|Daenerys II]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 12|Eddard II]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 3|Daenerys I]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 23|Daenerys III]]\n}} __NOTOC__\n\n[[Daenerys Targaryen]] is married to [[Khal]] [[Drogo]] in a ceremony that lasts all day with a dozen deaths. When night falls, Drogo takes Daenerys for a long ride before making love.\n\n==Synopsis==\nWhile waiting for [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]]\' wedding, [[Illyrio Mopatis]] explains that [[Drogo]]\'s \'\'[[khalasar]]\'\' of 40,000 [[Dothraki]] warriors and their families and herds gathered outside the walls of [[Pentos]] have made the other [[magister]]s so uneasy that they have doubled the city guard. The Dothraki are eating everything in sight, and Illyrio thinks it would be best to have the marriage as soon as possible. Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] has offered and been accepted into the service of Daenerys\' brother [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]]. Viserys is impatient for [[Drogo]] to help him regain his throne. Illyrio explains to him that the [[Khal]] must take his new bride to [[Vaes Dothrak]] first, and then wait until the omens are favorable for war. Viserys complains at the delay despite Illyrio and Jorah cautioning patience.\n\nThat night, Daenerys dreams of Viserys chasing and beating her and saying, &quot;You woke the dragon.&quot; Then she turns to see a dragon in his place and wakes shaking with a fine sheen of sweat on her skin.\n\n[[File:Sept13 Wedding Feast II.png|300px|left|thumb|Drogo and Daenerys at their wedding feast]]\n\nDaenerys weds Khal Drogo under the open sky, before forty thousand Dothraki warriors. The ceremonies begin at dawn and continue until dusk. Viserys, Illyrio, and Jorah are seated below Drogo and Daenerys at the feast, which grates on Viserys\' pride, especially when food is first served to Daenerys and Drogo before being offered to him. Daenerys, with the forced smile her brother told her she should wear, eats little since her stomach is upset. She is seated only with her new husband, and they do not even share a common language, so there is nothing for her to do.\n\nEarly on in the day she sees Dothraki men taking dancing women and mounting them in the open like animals. When two men grab the same woman, a fight to the death ensues. The survivor then takes another woman. Illyrio has told her that a Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered dull; by the end of the day a dozen men have died, obviously making it an exceptional wedding. Daenerys is consumed by fear of her hulking husband with a stern cruel face and a culture that is so different, and of her brother if she should fail him.\n\nAs the sun sets, Daenerys receives her bride gifts. Viserys gives her three hand maids that cost him nothing, picked to teach her what she needs to know: [[Irri]] (to teach her how to ride), [[Jhiqui]] (to teach her the Dothraki tongue) and [[Doreah]] (to teach her the arts of love). Ser Jorah, with an apology since it was all he could afford, gives her a stack of old books in the [[Common Tongue]], and she thanks him with all her heart. Illyrio gives her fine silks and fabrics, and three huge [[dragon]]\'s eggs: one is green, one is cream-colored, and one is black with scarlet ripples and swirls. Illyrio tells her that they have turned to stone over the years. Khal Drogo\'s [[bloodrider| bloodriders]] give her the traditional three weapons, which she refuses with the traditional refusals and passes to her husband. Many other gifts come from the other Dothraki. \n\n[[File:Silver Drogo gift.jpg|300px|thumb|Drogo\'s wedding gift ([[Game of Thrones|TV]])]]\n\nLast of all Drogo brings forward his own bride gift, a fine grey [[The silver|filly]]. Drogo easily lifts her by the waist up to the saddle. She does not know what to do. Ser Jorah tells her to take the reins and ride. She is only a fair rider, having traveled almost exclusively by other means, but as she rides, she forgets her fears and eventually sends the horse into a gallop, and even has it leap over a firepit. She returns and tells Illyrio to tell her husband that he has given her the wind, and Drogo smiles. Then the sun sets and Drogo readies his horse. When Viserys warns her to please her husband, lest she will regret it, fear comes back to her.\n\nDrogo sets a fast pace, saying nothing. Daenerys tries to rid herself of her fear by remembering she is the blood of the dragon and the dragon is never afraid. It is full dark when they stop at a grassy place beside a small stream. Drogo swings off his horse and lifts her down from hers. She feels fragile in her wedding silks. She begins to weep, but Drogo says &quot;No,&quot; and wipes her tears away. She asks questions but all Drogo says is \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d He starts softly murmuring to her in Dothraki to soothe her. Drogo sets her down on a rock and sits facing her, then starts removing the bells from his hair, and Daenerys helps. Then he indicates that she should unbraid his hair, which takes a long time. Then Drogo undresses her, with tenderness, and caresses her until she is ready for him. When he bares her breasts, she covers herself with her hands but Drogo gently pulls her hands away. After he finishes undressing her, he watches her for a while. Then he begins to touch her face and hair. It seems like hours to Daenerys before his hands go to her breasts. This makes Daenerys breathless, and when he seats her on his lap and asks \xe2\x80\x9cNo?\xe2\x80\x9d she moves his hand inside her and says \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Cohollo]]\n*[[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n*[[Doreah]]\n*[[Drogo]]\n*[[Haggo]]\n| style=&quot;width:33%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Illyrio Mopatis]]\n*[[Irri]]\n*[[Jhiqui]]\n*[[Jorah Mormont]]\n*[[Qotho]]\n*[[Viserys Targaryen]]\n| style=&quot;width:33%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Aegon I Targaryen]]\n|}\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[Asshai]]\n*[[Dragonstone]]\n*[[Lys]]\n*[[Pentos]]\n*[[Seven Kingdoms]]\n*[[Shadow Lands]]\n*[[Vaes Dothrak]]\n*[[Valyria]]\n| style=&quot;width:33%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*\'\'[[arakh]]\'\'\n*[[Bloodrider]]\n*[[Common Tongue]]\n*\'\'[[dosh khaleen]]\'\'\n*[[Dothraki]]\n*[[Dragon]]\n*[[Free City]]\n| style=&quot;width:33%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[Horselord]]\n*\'\'[[Khal]]\'\'\n*\'\'[[khalasar]]\'\'\n*\'\'[[khaleesi]]\'\'\n*[[Magister]]\n*[[Usurper]]\n*[[House Targaryen]]\n|}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2009/05/jon-daenerys.html Humorous review of the chapter]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/04/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-6 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/011/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{EnWikia|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 11|small=yes}}\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 11]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Daenerys Targaryen|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 11]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Pentos]]\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 11]]\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 12, Daenerys]]\n[[pt:A Guerra dos Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 11]]\n[[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\x94\xd1\x8d\xd0\xb9\xd0\xbd\xd0\xb5\xd1\x80\xd0\xb8\xd1\x81 II]]</text>\n      <sha1>n5ql0d5u7mdfkgov8g6lsj8tpuc1e4m</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 31</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6855</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>197174</id>\n      <parentid>196898</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2017-01-30T15:53:14Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4312">{{Infobox Chapter ADwD\n| pov\t\t= [[Melisandre]]\n| place         = [[Castle Black]]\n| title\t\t= Melisandre I\n| page\t\t= 407\n| previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 30|Daenerys V]]\n| current\t= Melisandre I\n| next\t\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 32|Reek III]]\n| arc previous\t= \n| arc next\t= \n}}\n\n[[File:UrukkiSaki TEC.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Melisandre may have glimpsed the [[three-eyed crow]] and [[Bran]] in her fires - by Urukki Saki \xc2\xa9]]\n==Synopsis==\n[[Melisandre]] is in her chambers, looking into the fire and trying to receive her visions. When she looks for Stannis, she sees eyeless faces staring out, crying blood. Then she sees towers by the sea followed by skulls rising out of the ocean turning to mist and great winged beasts flying in the sky. She tries to see the girl on the fleeing horse again as she knows [[Jon Snow|Jon]] will want to know more, but she cannot find anything. She does see that there is death around Jon and that dangers and enemies lurk all around him.\n\nWhen [[Devan Seaworth|Devan]] asks her what she sees, she replies with her usual answer &quot;Much and more.&quot; She does not let him know how difficult it is or how much pain she endures to try and see these things, for fear of letting others know that this task is not as simple as she lets on. Melisandre knows and sees that [[Davos Seaworth|Davos]] is the most loyal to [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] thus she has kept Devan back against the young boy\'s wishes. She knows that Davos has lost too many sons already and although Stannis has ridden out, she keeps the boy in order to save one of Davos\' sons.\n\nMelisandre does not sleep much, often just an hour a night, as she fears to dream and what she sees there, re-occurring images of the words &quot;Lot Seven&quot; and &quot;Melony&quot;.\n\nShe sends Devan to go get [[Rattleshirt]] and bring him to her. She speaks with him and tells him to keep his bones on, in order to keep the [[glamor]] spell active. She also asks that he go and fetch the girl she saw on the dying horse. She tells him of her vision and asks him where the girl might be coming up, and, knowing the North well, he can guess her location, west of [[Long Lake]]. Their talk is disrupted by the single long drone of a horn, marking the return of the rangers. She tells Rattleshirt to wait for him there and she goes to see the rangers, thinking of her prediction of three dead rangers.\n\nUpon arrival she sees Jon with the heads of [[Black Jack Bulwer]], [[Hairy Hal]] and [[Garth Greyfeather]], impaled on spears.&lt;ref&gt;As she foretold shortly before in [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 28|Chapter 28]]&lt;/ref&gt; She walks with Jon and they go back to her room. There he sees Rattleshirt, but she removes the glamor to show him that he is actually [[Mance Rayder]], whom she has spared. She tells him that he will bring Jon back his sister, but Jon mistrusts her. She does not reveal the difficulty of her glamor spell to the men, thinking to herself that the more effortless sorcery appears, the more men fear it and her.\n\n\n==Character list==\n{{columns|7|\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Melisandre]]\n*[[Devan Seaworth]]\n*[[Morgan]]\n*[[Merrel]]\n*[[Bowen Marsh]]\n*[[Jon Snow]]\n*[[Ghost]]\n*[[Dolorous Edd]]\n*[[Hobb]]\n*[[Mully]]\n*[[Owen the Oaf|Owen]]\n*[[Cellador]]\n*[[Alf]]\n*[[Mance Rayder]]\n\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Rattleshirt]]\n*[[Stannis Baratheon]]\n*[[Azor Ahai]]\n*[[Davos Seaworth]]\n*[[Weeper]]\n*[[Tormund]]\n*[[Black Jack Bulwer]]\n*[[Hairy Hal]]\n*[[Garth Greyfeather]]\n*[[Denys Mallister]]\n*[[Selyse Florent]]\n*[[Shireen Baratheon]]\n*[[Dywen]]\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Arya Stark]]\n*[[Ygritte]]\n}}\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{columns|7|\n*[[Lord of Light]]\n*[[R\'hllor]]\n*[[Castle Black]]\n*[[Deepwood Motte]]\n*[[Battle of the Blackwater]]\n*[[The Wall]]\n*[[Asshai]]\n*[[Night\'s Watch]]\n*[[King\'s Tower]]\n*[[Narrow sea]]\n*[[Children of the forest]]\n*[[Long Lake]]\n*[[Kingsroad]]\n*[[Haunted forest]]\n*[[Shadow Tower]]\n*[[Gorge]]\n*[[Bridge of Skulls]]\n*[[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]]\n*[[Mole\'s Town]]\n}}\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 31]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Melisandre]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Castle Black]]\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 31]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 32, Melisandre]]\n[[zh:\xe9\xad\x94\xe9\xbe\x99\xe7\x9a\x84\xe7\x8b\x82\xe8\x88\x9e-\xe7\xab\xa0\xe8\x8a\x82 31]]</text>\n      <sha1>78iyr8j3ydov4ln2swe35hfca01sdua</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 57</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5812</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>159643</id>\n      <parentid>122046</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-02-09T18:57:30Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys_Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5090">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]]\n| title\t\t= Daenerys V\n| place         = [[Meereen]]\n| page\t\t= 639\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 56|Bran IV]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 57|Daenerys V]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 58|Tyrion VII]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 42|Daenerys IV]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 71|Daenerys VI]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Meereen]] is enclosed by a great wall, with hundreds of defenders to guard it. [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]]\xe2\x80\x99s huge army consists mostly of freed slaves. They are eating up the surrounding lands, and Daenerys realizes that she must claim the city before the army starves. Aware that storming the walls will cost her a great deal, Daenerys sends Strong [[Belwas]] to dispatch the Hero of Meereen. Belwas kills [[Oznak zo Pahl]], but the city still stands strong. Brown [[Ben Plumm]] reveals a way into the city through the sewers, and we find out that Dany\xe2\x80\x99s dragons seem to like Brown Ben, and perch on his shoulder when he visits.\n\nDaenerys, however, finds herself drawn to [[Daario Naharis]], and keeps thinking of his blue eyes. Later, she goes off with [[Barristan Selmy|Arstan]] and [[Missandei]] to visit the camps, and there she is attacked by [[Mero]] of Braavos. Arstan kills the Titan\xe2\x80\x99s Bastard with his staff alone, and when Dany reaches her pavilion, [[Jorah Mormont|Jorah]] is shocked to learn that a squire with a staff could defeat Mero with such ease. Arstan reveals that he is actually a knight, and Jorah finally recognizes him as Barristan the Bold. Barristan apologizes for deceiving her, and swears his sword in her service. Jorah warns her not to accept the man, for he went over to [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] after [[Battle of the Trident|the Trident]]. But Barristan reveals that Jorah has spied on her on behalf of [[Varys]] and the [[Small Council]] in hopes of gaining a royal pardon. Jorah pleads that he did so only at first, but he has been loyal to her since the birth of the dragons. Daenerys, disgusted, dismisses them both. She doesn\'t want them in her service any more. When she wonders where to send them, she suddenly has an idea.\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n*[[Daario Naharis]]\n*[[Oznak zo Pahl]]\n*[[Aggo]]\n*[[Jhogo]]\n*[[Rakharo]]\n*[[Jorah Mormont]]\n*[[Barristan Selmy|Arstan Whitebeard]]/[[Barristan Selmy]]\n*[[Ben Plumm|Brown Ben Plumm]]\n*[[Belwas|Strong Belwas]]\n*[[Jhiqui]]\n*[[Missandei]]\n*[[Irri]]\n*[[Grey Worm]]\n*[[Viserion]]\n*[[Drogon]]\n*[[The Silver]]\n*[[Mero|Mero of Braavos]]\n*[[Rhaegal]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Scarb]]\n*[[Prendahl na Ghezn]]\n*[[Sallor|Sallor the Bald]]\n*[[Illyrio Mopatis]]\n*[[Drogo|Khal Drogo]]\n*[[Groleo]]\n*[[Viserys Targaryen]]\n*[[Aegon I Targaryen]]\n*[[Ossifer Plumm]]\n*[[Rhaegar Targaryen]]\n*[[Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaegar)]]\n*[[Robert I Baratheon]]\n*[[Aerys II Targaryen]]\n*[[Manfred Swann]]\n*[[Rhaegar Targaryen]]\n*[[Jaime Lannister]]\n*[[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n*[[Gerold Hightower]]\n*[[Varys]]\n|}\n\n==Places and Terms Mentioned==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[Meereen]]\n*[[Astapor]]\n*[[Yunkai]]\n*[[Great Pyramid]]\n*[[Tyrosh]]\n*[[Westeros]]\n*[[Skahazadhan]]\n*[[Slaver\'s Bay]]\n*[[Seven Kingdoms]]\n*[[Lands of the Long Summer]]\n*[[Pentos]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[Red Waste]]\n*[[Braavos]]\n*[[Summer Islands]]\n*[[Ibben]]\n*[[Qohor]]\n*[[Dorne]]\n*[[Valyria]]\n*[[Qarth]]\n*[[King\'s Landing]]\n*[[Trident]]\n*[[Dothraki Sea]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[Bloodrider]]\n*\'\'[[khalasar]]\'\'\n*[[Great Masters]]\n*[[Second Sons]]\n*[[Sellsword]]\n*\'\'[[arakh]]\'\'\n*[[Stormcrows]]\n*[[Dothraki]]\n*\'\'[[khaleesi]]\'\'\n*[[Unsullied]]\n*\'\'[[khal]]\'\'\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[Dragon]]\n*\'\'[[ko]]\'\'\n*[[House Targaryen]]\n*[[Tokar]]\n*[[Iron Throne]]\n*[[Balerion (ship)|Balerion]]/\'\'[[Saduleon]]\'\'\n*[[Meraxes (ship)|Meraxes]]/\'\'[[Joso\'s Prank]]\'\'\n*[[Vhagar (ship)|Vhagar]]/\'\'[[Summer Sun]]\'\'\n*[[Magister]]\n*[[Doom of Valyria]]\n*[[Balerion (god)]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[Meraxes (god)]]\n*[[Vhagar (god)]]\n*[[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard]]\n*[[Kingsguard]]\n*[[Small Council]]\n*[[Battle of the Trident]]\n*[[House Lannister]]\n*[[Others]]\n*[[Undying Ones]]\n|}\n\n==References and Notes==\n*The synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/07/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-35 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Part 35].

When the [[small council]] also sides against him, Ned resigns in protest. As Ned prepares to return to [[Winterfell]], [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] arrives with news that he has identified the [[Chataya\'s brothel|brothel]] that [[Jon Arryn]] and [[Stannis Baratheon]] visited.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n[[File:Thomas Denmark council.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Robert Baratheon\xe2\x80\x99s small council \xc2\xa9 FFG]]\n \n[[Eddard Stark|Ned]] is trying to dissuade King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] from sending men to kill [[Daenerys Targaryen]], now that [[Varys]] has received reports of her pregnancy. Robert wants every [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] dead and grows very angry with Ned\xe2\x80\x99s resistance. Ned insists that even if the report is true a lot can happen before the child is old enough to be a threat; the mother might miscarry, or the child might be born female or die in infancy. Ned also proclaims that he will only fear the [[Dothraki]] when they teach their horses to run on water.\n\n[[Renly Baratheon|Renly]] comments that it was a mistake to allow [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]] and Daenerys to live this long. Ned insists that mercy is never a mistake, pointing out that at the [[Battle of the Trident]] Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] slew a dozen friends of both Ned and Robert, yet Robert absolved him and appointed him [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard]]. Robert insists that it is not the same; Ser Barristan was a knight of the [[Kingsguard]]. Ned counters that Daenerys is a 14-year-old girl and asks why they overthrew [[House Targaryen]] if not to end the murder of children. Robert growls that it was to put an end to Targaryens.\n\nWhen Ned questions how a man who never feared [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] can tremble at the shadow of an unborn child, King Robert bellows that he has heard enough and asks for a vote. The other councilors all side with the king except for Ser Barristan who states that there is no honor in killing an enemy in his mother\xe2\x80\x99s womb. \n\nWith the decision made, Robert turns to the topic of how best to carry out the assassination. Renly suggests that Ser [[Jorah Mormont]], who craves a royal pardon, might be of use. Varys reminds them all that Ser Jorah is unlikely to risk the punishment the Dothraki would inflict on the murderer of a \'\'[[khaleesi]]\'\'. Instead, the eunuch proposes the alternative of [[poison]], such as the [[Tears of Lys]]; [[Khal]] [[Drogo]] need never know it was not a natural death. \n\nThe mention of the Tears of Lys seems to awaken Grand [[Maester]] [[Pycelle]] from his drowsiness and Robert denounces poison as a coward\xe2\x80\x99s weapon. Ned remarks on the hypocrisy of debating an honorable way to assassinate a 14-year-old and declares that Robert should do the killing himself, the honorable way among the [[First Men]]. Robert is astounded when he realizes that Ned actually means what he has just said.\n\n[[File:Ours is the Fury Lukasz Jaskolski II.jpg|Ned removes his badge of office, declaring that he thought Robert was a better man. \xc2\xa9 FFG|thumb|350px|right]]\n\nNed refuses to participate further, declaring that Robert can do as he likes but that he will have no part of it. Robert declares that, as [[Hand of the King|Hand]], Ned will do as commanded or be replaced by a Hand who will. Ned wishes luck to his replacement and removes his badge of office, declaring that he thought Robert was a better man. As Ned marches away, the king calls after him that he will have Ned\xe2\x80\x99s head on a spike if he ever sees him again. Before Ned has even left, the council resumes the discussion and Ned overhears Pycelle telling the others of a society of assassins in [[Braavos]] called the [[Faceless Men]]. Littlefinger counters that they can hire an army of [[Mercenary|sellswords]] for a fraction of the price.\n\nNed returns to the [[Tower of the Hand]] and summons [[Vayon Poole]] to discuss arrangements for their return to [[Winterfell]]. Ned is disturbed that Robert still hates the long dead Rhaegar Targaryen so much. Then Ned thinks about what will happen when the king discovers that [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] has taken [[Tyrion Lannister]] captive. The king may not care for the Imp, but it will hurt his pride, and [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] will whisper in his ear. With these thoughts, Ned decides that it might be safest if he and the girls go ahead, and the rest can follow. \n\nAfter Poole leaves, Ned reflects that it will be wonderful to be back at Winterfell with his sons, but he remains angry because the kingdom is in a crisis: Robert and his council of cravens and flatterers will beggar the realm, or sell it to the Lannisters. Then there is the murder of [[Jon Arryn]]. Ned considers taking a ship back to Winterfell, even though he would prefer the [[kingsroad]], so that he can stop at [[Dragonstone]] and maybe learn the truth from [[Stannis Baratheon]]. \n\nThe more he thinks about it, the more Ned guesses the truth is a secret he may not want to know. He looks again at the assassin\xe2\x80\x99s dagger and wonders if it has some connection to the mystery of Arryn\xe2\x80\x99s death. Could Robert be part of it? He remembers Catelyn telling him that he knew the man but the king is someone different. Ned summons Poole back and tells him to find a fast ship with a good captain, quietly but quickly; if he could find a ship tomorrow, it would be best to be on it.\n\n[[Tomard]] announces the arrival of Littlefinger. Ned is tempted to send him away, but thinks better of it. Littlefinger informs Ned that he has managed to convince the council to offer a lordship to any man who kills Daenerys rather than hire the Faceless Men. When Ned criticizes the principle of giving titles to assassins, Littlefinger points out that he actually did Daenerys more good than Ned did; if a [[Faceless Man]] were to be sent against the girl she would be as good as buried, whereas this way some idiot will likely botch the job and put the Dothraki on their guard. \n\nNed is incredulous; Littlefinger supported the proposal but now expects him to believe that he was defending the girl. Littlefinger then calls Ned an enormous fool who rules like a man dancing on rotten ice. Ned insists that he has had his fill of politics. Littlefinger then says that if Ned is still in the city this evening he will take him to the [[Chataya\'s brothel|brothel]] his men have been searching for so ineffectually.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/07/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-17 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/034/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n== References and Notes ==\n[[Category:A_Song_of_Ice_And_Fire_chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 33]]\n[[Category:A_Song_of_Ice_And_Fire_chapters--POV_Eddard_Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 34, Eddard]][[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\xad\xd0\xb4\xd0\xb4\xd0\xb0\xd1\x80\xd0\xb4 VIII]]</text>\n      <sha1>br1fr4sug1z4o52lxk6ttnaias10v04</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Feast for Crows-Chapter 31</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5973</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>198131</id>\n      <parentid>166959</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2017-03-31T15:06:47Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Nittanian</username>\n        <id>3504</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <minor/>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3142">{{Infobox Chapter AFfC\n| pov\t\t= [[Brienne of Tarth]]\n| title\t\t= Brienne VI\n| place         = the [[Quiet Isle]]\n| page\t\t= 460\n| previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 30|Jaime IV]]\n| current\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 31|Brienne VI]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 32|Cersei VII]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 25|Brienne V]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 37|Brienne VII]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\nUpon reaching the [[Quiet Isle]], [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]] and her companions are taken up the path to see the [[Elder Brother (Quiet Isle)|Elder Brother]]. Brienne mentions to the brother guiding them that she is heading for [[Saltpans]] to kill [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]]. This takes the man aback, but he tells them to speak to their elder. They see a huge horse in their stables, obviously a war horse, who has mauled two of the brothers. On a hill, they pass a [[Gravedigger|huge cloaked novice]] digging graves. The man appears lame, but they cannot see his face. \n\nThe Elder Brother speaks further of the horrible raid on Saltpans, made worse by the fact that Ser [[Quincy Cox]] hid behind his castle walls and did nothing to help the villagers. \n\nAfter dinner, the Elder Brother speaks in private with Brienne. He asks what she seeks in Saltpans, and when she mentions a highborn girl, the elder knows she refers to [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]]. He lets on that it is the wrong Stark she seeks, for the Hound captured [[Arya Stark|Arya]]. Shocked that both of Lady [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]]\'s daughters may yet be alive, she is equally surprised when he informs her that Sandor Clegane is dead. The Elder Brother has buried his corpse himself, and left the hound\'s-head helm on the grave. It was [[Rorge|some other outlaw]] who found and wore it when they raided Saltpans. \n\nHe goes on to tell her that he took pity on Sandor before he died, and will only say that \'\'&quot;he is at rest&quot;\'\' when she asks if he is truly dead. The elder remarks that the horse in their stables was the Hound\'s, [[Stranger (horse)|Stranger]]. \n\nThe Elder Brother then tells her that he was once a knight who fought for Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]] at the [[Battle of the Trident|Trident]]. He took several terrible wounds in the battle and fell into the river, yet awoke upon the shores of the Quiet Isle. He urges her not to be another casualty of this war, and return home. Brienne breaks down and cries, telling him her story, finishing with, \'\'&quot;I have to try to save her... or die in the attempt.&quot;\'\'\n\n==References and Notes==\n* The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html] \n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/07/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-feast-for-crows-part-22 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Feast for Crows, Part 22].

Soon after, [[Tyrion Lannister]] and his party arrive. Tyrion recognizes Catelyn, who had hoped to remain anonymous, and Catelyn takes this opportunity to convince the men in the room to take Tyrion captive so he can face the king\xe2\x80\x99s justice in [[Winterfell]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Catelyn Tully|Catelyn]] and Ser [[Rodrik Cassel|Rodrik]] are on the [[kingsroad]], headed north to [[Winterfell]]. It is raining and Ser Rodrik suggests Catelyn should cover her head to keep from taking a chill. Catelyn, however, enjoys the feel of the rain on her face and replies that it is only water. The warm southern rain reminds Catelyn of her childhood with [[Edmure Tully|Edmure]], [[Lysa Tully|Lysa]], and [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] at [[Riverrun]]. Rains are much less pleasant in [[the North]].\n\nRodrik states it would be good to have a fire and a warm meal. Catelyn tells him that there is an [[inn at the crossroads]] only a short way ahead. Catelyn remembers sleeping there many times when traveling with her [[Hoster Tully|father]] when she was young, when it was run by a fat woman named [[Masha Heddle]]. Ser Rodrik reminds her that an inn is too public and that it might be best to find a small holdfast if they do not want to be recognized. However, when they pass unrecognized by a party of soldiers led by Lord [[Jason Mallister]], a bannerman to her father, Catelyn decides they will not be recognized at the inn.\n\n[[File:Inn at the Crossroads.jpg|thumb|170px|left|The inn at the crossroads by Marc Simonetti \xc2\xa9 Fantasy Flight Games]]\n\nAt the inn, they are met by Masha Heddle, who gives them only a cursory look and tells them there are only two rooms available; she gives them none of the smiles or mention of sweet cakes that Catelyn remembers from her girlhood. After changing into dry clothes, Catelyn thinks that from the crossroads they could go west to [[Riverrun]] where she could get advice from her father who has been unwell lately. To the east is the [[Eyrie]] and her sister; Lysa might be able to provide some answers, but the road across the mountains is too dangerous. Eventually, Catelyn decides that it is best to continue north to [[Winterfell]]. Once past [[the Neck]] they can get aid from one of the bannermen of [[House Stark]]. Then she can tell the bannerman to send riders north to [[Robb Stark|Robb]] with orders to place a watch on the kingsroad. \n\nCatelyn turns her thoughts to the reliability of Riverrun\xe2\x80\x99s banners. If it comes to war, Catelyn is sure her father will call his banners, but she is not sure they will all come. [[Robert\'s Rebellion]] showed how unreliable the river lords can be, particularly the [[House Frey|Freys]], who arrived to aid their Tully overlords only after the [[Battle of the Trident]] had been won, leaving doubts as to which army they had come to join. Ever since, Catelyn\'s father has called Lord [[Walder Frey]] the \xe2\x80\x9cLate Lord Frey&quot;. Other banners\xe2\x80\x94such as the [[House Darry|Darrys]], [[House Ryger|Rygers]], and [[House Mooton|Mootons]]\xe2\x80\x94fought for King [[Aerys II Targaryen]]. Catelyn decides she must not let a war erupt.\n\nSer Rodrik comes to escort her to dinner, suggesting they must hurry if they are to eat and calling her the customary \xe2\x80\x9cmy lady.\xe2\x80\x9d Catelyn decides it might be safer to pretend they are father and daughter. Rodrik agrees, but in the process he calls her \xe2\x80\x9cmy lady\xe2\x80\x9d again, and comments on how old ways die hard when he realizes his mistake.\n\nIn the long and drafty common room the benches are crowded with a wide variety of people, but Catelyn doesn\'t see anyone who might recognize her. Ser Rodrik finds them a place by the kitchen where they are accosted by the singer [[Marillion]], who asks about where they come from and where they are going. Catelyn answers the safest of the questions, saying they come from [[King\'s Landing]]. The singer tells them that is his destination for the [[Tourney of the Hand]]. The singer is disappointed when Catelyn has not heard about him, and proceeds to attempt to get paid silver for a song. Ser Rodrik, believing that any healthy boy would prefer a sword to a lyre, tells him he might have a couple of coppers but would prefer tossing them down a well to hearing the boy\xe2\x80\x99s howling. The singer then tells how he was made to sing for kings and high lords. Catelyn asks if Marillion has ever played for Lord Tully. The singer boasts that a chamber is kept for him at Riverrun and that the young Lord Tully is like a brother. This amuses Catelyn, who knows her brother has hated singers ever since one bedded a girl he liked.\n\nIt is then that the door bangs open and the arrival of [[Tyrion Lannister]] is announced, with a demand for room and a bath for Tyrion. When Tyrion is told that there are no rooms, he announces that his servants can sleep in the stable, and quips that he needs only a small room. When Masha Heddle repeats that there are no rooms, Tyrion takes a gold coin and flips it into the air. A free rider tells Tyrion he is welcome to his take his room, and Tyrion flips the coin to the man.\n\n[[File:Tyrion arrested by Catelyn.png|thumb|370px|right|I call upon you to seize him \xe2\x80\x94 ([[Game of Thrones|TV series]]) \xc2\xa9 HBO]]\n\nTyrion declares that he wants some sort of roast fowl and the best wine sent up to his room, and asks the [[Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch|black brother]] [[Yoren]] to join him. Marillion the singer stands and offers to sing to Tyrion of his father\xe2\x80\x99s [[Sack of King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing|victory]] at King\'s Landing while he dines. Tyrion replies that such a song would surely ruin his supper. He is about to turn away when his eyes find Catelyn, and he comments that he was sorry to have missed her at Winterfell. Everyone in the inn is astonished, and every eye is turned to Catelyn as she stands. \n\nCatelyn decides to play her hand. She asks some of the men-at-arms in the room directly if their lords are true to her father, Lord Hoster Tully. The [[House Bracken|Brackens]], [[House Frey|Freys]], and [[House Whent|Whents]] are all represented in the room, and all answer with polite agreement. Tyrion is confused and asks what Catelyn is doing, even sniggering at one of the comments. Catelyn then tells the bannermen that Tyrion, while a [[Guest right|guest]] in her home, sent an assassin to murder [[Bran Stark|her son]] in his bed. In the name of King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] and the lords they serve, Catelyn calls upon them to seize Tyrion and return him to Winterfell to await the king\xe2\x80\x99s justice. \n\nCatelyn cannot decide which is more satisfying: the sound of a dozen men drawing their swords or the look on Tyrion Lannister\xe2\x80\x99s face.\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Catelyn Stark]]\n*[[Rodrik Cassel]]\n*[[Masha Heddle]]\n*[[Jason Mallister|Lord Jason Mallister]]\n*[[Patrek Mallister]]\n*[[Marillion]]\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Yoren]]\n\n\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Edmure Tully]]\n*[[Lysa Tully]]\n*[[Petyr Baelish]]\n*[[Hoster Tully]]\n*[[Brynden Tully]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n*[[House Blackwood]]\n*[[House Bracken]]\n*[[Shella Whent|Lady Whent]]\n*[[Walder Frey|Lord Frey]]\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[House Darry]]\n*[[House Ryger]]\n*[[House Mooton]]\n*[[Rhaegar Targaryen]]\n*[[Jaime Lannister]]\n*[[Loras Tyrell]]\n*[[Alia of Braavos]]\n*[[Bran Stark]]\n*[[Jonos Bracken]]\n*[[Robert I Baratheon|Robert Baratheon]]\n|}\n==Terms and places mentioned==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[Kingsroad]]\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Riverrun]]\n*[[Godswood]]\n*[[Casterly Rock]]\n*[[Winterfell]]\n*[[Mountains of the Moon]]\n*[[Vale of Arryn]]\n*[[The Eyrie]]\n*[[King\'s Landing]]\n*[[Harrenhal]]\n\n\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[Shadowcat]]\n|}\n\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Items and events:\'\'\'\n*[[Hand\'s Tourney]]\n|}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/07/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-14 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/029/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 28]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Catelyn Tully]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Crossroads Inn]]\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 28]]\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 29, Catelyn]]\n[[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\x9a\xd0\xb5\xd0\xb9\xd1\x82\xd0\xb8\xd0\xbb\xd0\xb8\xd0\xbd V]]</text>\n      <sha1>7re0lks05b0plj5icjfhlma03h1pv7n</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 21</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>4980</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>162498</id>\n      <parentid>161645</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-03-16T17:36:44Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Nittanian</username>\n        <id>3504</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <minor/>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4358">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]\n| title\t\t= Jaime III\n| place         = [[Maidenpool]] - road to [[Duskendale]]\n| page\t\t= 235\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 20|Catelyn III]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 21|Jaime III]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 22|Arya II]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 11|Jaime II]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 31|Jaime IV]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]], [[Cleos Frey|Cleos]], and [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] are still travelling to [[King\'s Landing]]. They visit [[Maidenpool]], but finding the town deserted, continue on toward [[Duskendale]]. Jaime has no success in provoking Brienne into a fight. He misses [[Cersei Lannister|his twin]] and thinks back about their childhood. Even as children they were close and they slept together. Once [[Joanna Lannister|their mother]] caught them. She was shocked and moved Jaime\'s bedchamber far away from Cersei\'s. Jaime muses that he should marry his sister as the [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]] did. \n\nSuddenly they are attacked by archers. Jaime and Brienne charge at them and the archers run away in the forest. They go back to find that ser Cleos is dead. His horse threw him off but as his feet was stuck in the stirrups he was dragged with his head bouncing against the ground. Jaime takes Cleos\'s sword and attacks Brienne. Although he is still chained he is confident that he can beat her. They fight for a long time. Jaime is amazed at her skill with the sword and realizes that she is stronger than him. Finally Brienne beats him. \n\nWhen they look up a number of men surround them. Jaime recognizes them as the [[Brave Companions]]. They quickly inform him that they have gone over to the [[House Stark|Starks]]. Jaime and Brienne are severely beaten and taken prisoner. Jaime warns Brienne that she will be raped and advises her not to resist, as this will make it worse. He tries to save her by telling the Brave Companions that [[Tarth]] is called the Sapphire Isle and that Brienne will be worth a high ransom. He tries to persuade the leader of the Brave Companions, [[Vargo Hoat]] in releasing them for a high ransom. Vargo Hoat replies that he will give [[Tywin Lannister|Jaime\'s father]] a message. His men grab Jaime and hold him down.  [[Zollo]] raises his sword and brings it down as Jaime screams.\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Jaime Lannister]]\n*[[Brienne of Tarth]]\n*[[Cleos Frey]]\n*[[Rorge]]\n*[[Timeon]]\n*[[Urswyck]]\n*Fat [[Zollo]]\n*[[Vargo Hoat]]\n*[[Shagwell]]\n\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[William Mooton|Lord Mooton]]\n*[[Florian the Fool]]\n*[[Jonquil]]\n*[[Cersei Lannister]]\n*[[Joanna Lannister]]\n*[[Tywin Lannister]]\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Stannis Baratheon]]\n*[[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n*[[Myrcella Lannister]]\n*[[Sansa Stark]]\n*[[Catelyn Tully]]\n*[[Arya Stark]]\n*[[Aerys II Targaryen]]\n*[[Gerold Hightower]]\n*[[Arthur Dayne]]\n*[[Jon Umber_(Greatjon)|Greatjon Umber]]\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Lyle Crakehall]]\n*[[Gregor Clegane]]\n*[[Sandor Clegane]] \n*[[Amory Lorch]]\n*[[Roose Bolton]]\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Harren Hoare]]\n*[[Renly Baratheon]]\n|}\n\n==Places==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n*[[Maidenpool]]\n*[[Riverrun]]\n*[[King\'s Landing]]\n\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n*[[Evenfall Hall]]\n*[[Tarth]]\n*[[Harrenhal]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n*[[Casterly Rock]]\n*[[Duskendale]]\n|}\n\n==References and Notes==\n* [http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/12/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-12 A first-time reader\'s summary and commentary] of the chapter, by Leigh Butler\n* [http://slynt.blogspot.nl/2013/03/re-read-jaime-iii-hands-on-fightin.html Re-read Jaime III: Hands-On Fightin\'].

In his will, Robert declares Ned the [[Regent]]. Afterward, [[Renly Baratheon]] urges Ned to seize the royal children to secure his power, but Ned refuses. Ned writes a letter offering the throne to [[Stannis Baratheon]] as the rightful heir. Reconsidering his need for men, Ned declares his intentions to [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] and asks him to arrange the support of the [[City Watch of King\'s Landing|City Watch]].\n\n==Synopsis==    \n[[Eddard Stark|Ned]] is dreaming of walking through the crypts beneath [[Winterfell]]. The [[King in the North|Kings of Winter]] watch him with eyes of ice and the [[direwolf|direwolves]] at their feet snarl. Finally, he comes to the tomb where [[Rickard Stark|his father]] sleeps with [[Lyanna Stark|Lyanna]] and [[Brandon Stark|Brandon]] beside him. Lyanna\'s statue whispers, \xe2\x80\x9cPromise me, Ned,\xe2\x80\x9d and her eyes weep blood. Ned jerks awake with someone pounding at his door.\n\nThe king\xe2\x80\x99s steward tells Ned that King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] demands his presence at once. When Ned reaches [[Red Keep#Maegor\'s Holdfast|Maegor\'s Holdfast]], he finds the [[Kingsguard]] guarding the bridge, the steps, and the royal apartments. Ned only has to look at Ser [[Barristan Selmy]], who is waiting outside the king\xe2\x80\x99s bedchamber, to know something is terribly wrong. \n\n[[File:Chris Dien Robert deathbead.jpg|left|310px|thumb|King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]]\'s deathbed]]\nInside the bedchamber, he finds Robert in bed with [[Maester#Grand Maester|Grand Maester]] [[Pycelle]], [[Renly Baratheon]], and [[Cersei Lannister]] gathered around him. The room smells of smoke, blood, and death. Tattered and blood-stained clothes litter the floor. Ned can see that his friend is dying. Renly explains that it was a boar, and Robert curses himself for drinking too much wine and missing his thrust. When Ned asks where the rest of them were, Renly explains that Robert had called everyone off to try to take the boar himself. Ned lifts the blanket and verifies that they have done what they can to close the rip from groin to nipple, but it is not nearly enough. The smell of death is horrible and overpowering; Robert declares that even he can smell it, but still takes pride in having killed the boar, which he wants served at his funeral feast. \n\nRobert then orders everyone but Ned to leave. Pycelle tries to give Robert the [[milk of the poppy]] before leaving, but Robert refuses. Once they are gone, Ned damns Robert for being so headstrong. Robert damns Ned right back, declaring that he killed the boar and should have done the same to Ned for not leaving him to hunt in peace. He then admits that Ned was right about [[Daenerys Targaryen]] and asserts the boar was sent by the gods to punish him. Robert then expresses gratitude and admiration that Ned was the only one to tell him that he was wrong.\n\nRobert tells Ned to write his final testament, in which he names Ned as [[Regent|Lord Regent]] and Protector of the Realm until his son comes of age. Ned cannot bring himself to tell Robert that [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] is not his son, so instead he clandestinely changes the words to \xe2\x80\x9cmy heir,\xe2\x80\x9d feeling soiled as he does so. Ned tells Robert that he cannot die because the realm needs him, but Robert replies that the realm knows what a wretched king he was: as bad as [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys]]. Ned insists that Robert was not as bad as Aerys and Robert declares that at least this one thing he did right: he has declared Ned as Regent and Ned will do it well. Robert signs the document and tells Ned that they are to serve the boar at his funeral feast. He then asks that Ned rescind the death warrant on Daenerys and also to help his son be better than he has been. Before Ned leaves, the king mumbles that he ought to laugh at being killed by a pig, but it hurts too much. \n\nThe queen has left, but the rest come back in. The king has Renly and Pycelle bear witness to his placing the seal on the letter. Then the king asks for and drinks the milk of the poppy. As he fades off to sleep, he asks Ned if he will dream and Ned assures him he will. Then Robert declares that he will give Ned\xe2\x80\x99s love to [[Lyanna Stark|Lyanna]]. Last of all, Robert requests that Ned guard his children. Unable to tell the truth and unable to lie, all that Ned can think of is Robert\xe2\x80\x99s bastards when he tells him that he will.\n\nPycelle tells Ned that he has done all that he can, but the wound has already mortified because it took two days to get Robert back. When Ned asks how long, he is told that by rights the king should be dead already. Renly adds that Robert was always strong, though perhaps not wise, recounting that Robert slew the boar even with his guts hanging out. Ned replies admiringly that Robert was never one to leave the battle with an enemy standing.\n\nSer Barristan is still standing outside and Ned tells him that the king is not to be disturbed. Ser Barristan laments that he has failed his sacred trust. Ned reassures the old knight that no one can defend a man against himself and even the king blamed the wine. The knight admits that Robert was reeling drunk. [[Varys]], who has just appeared, asks who gave Robert all the wine, and Ser Barristan tells them it was the king\xe2\x80\x99s elder squire, [[Lancel Lannister]]. Varys states that he hopes the lad does not blame himself. Ned informs Varys that the king wants the assassination of Daenerys canceled. Varys tells him that those birds have flown but he will do what he can.\n\n[[Tomard]] and [[Cayn]] are helping Ned across the bridge when Renly catches up and asks for a private word. Renly asks if Robert\xe2\x80\x99s will makes him regent and, knowing his answer, tells Ned that he has 100 swords to offer him. Renly declares that if they strike now, they can take the [[Red Keep]] and seize the royal children. Ned refuses, stating that while Robert is still alive he will not shed blood in the castle. Renly insists that every moment Ned delays gives Cersei more time to prepare. Ned declares that they should pray for Robert\xe2\x80\x99s recovery; sometimes the gods are merciful. Renly answers that the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] are not. \n\nBy the time he returns to his [[Red Keep#Tower of the Hand|tower]], Ned is wondering if he should have accepted Renly\xe2\x80\x99s offer; if the queen fights he will need every sword he can get. He has no taste for these intrigues. Ned first asks Cayn to bring [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] to him and then commands Tomard to take 20 men to escort his daughters to the ship to take them to Winterfell. He then tells Tomard to stop at [[Dragonstone]] on the way and deliver a letter for to Lord [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]], for his eyes only. After Tomard leaves, Ned sits in grief for his friend Robert and thinks how some will say that he had betrayed his king\xe2\x80\x99s friendship and disinherited his sons. He hopes the gods will know better and that Robert will learn the truth in the land beyond the grave. He then composes a letter to Stannis, telling him of Robert\xe2\x80\x99s death and offering him the throne as the rightful heir. As he seals the letter, Ned reflects that his regency will be short and then he can return to Winterfell.\n\nLittlefinger arrives and congratulates Ned for being named Protector of the Realm. When asked how he knows, Littlefinger states that Varys told him and that Ned has just confirmed it. Ned damns Varys and his birds and states that he does not trust him. Littlefinger declares that Ned is learning. Ned says he knows the secret that [[Jon Arryn]] was murdered for. Littlefinger\'s lack of reaction to the truth shows that he obviously knew the secret all along.\n\nNed declares his intention to offer the throne to Stannis, but Littlefinger says he would be wise to bow to [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]]. Stannis is not a friend of Ned or Littlefinger; even his brothers cannot stand him because he is hard and unyielding. Stannis will appoint his own Hand and Small Council, and his ascension will mean war for the realm. Stannis will seek the heads of Cersei and the children to secure his position on the [[Iron Throne]] (an act that will incite [[Tywin Lannister]] and the houses sworn to [[Casterly Rock]] to an uprising), those of Lords [[Mace Tyrell|Tyrell]] and [[Paxter Redwyne|Redwyne]] as revenge for the [[Siege of Storm\'s End]], and even Lord [[Balon Greyjoy]] for his [[Greyjoy Rebellion|rebellion]]. According to Littlefinger, anyone who stood by the [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]] during [[Robert\'s Rebellion]] or rose with the Greyjoys will have cause to fear Stannis\' ascent to the throne.\n\nLittlefinger proposes another course of action: that Ned make his peace with the Lannisters, wed [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] to Joffrey, [[Robb Stark|Robb]] to [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]], and [[Arya Stark|Arya]] to [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] and rule as Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm until Joffrey comes of age in four years\xe2\x80\x99 time. This should be sufficient time to deal with Stannis and, should Joffrey prove unsuitable, they can reveal the truth of his parentage and place Renly on the throne. Ned declares that what Littlefinger is proposing is treason. Littlefinger replies that it will only be treason if they lose. Ned tells him that he forgets Jon Arryn, [[Jory Cassel]], and the attempt to kill [[Bran Stark|Bran]]. Littlefinger states that the only thing he forgot was that he was talking to a [[House Stark|Stark]].\n\nNed declares that he is going to call on the aid Littlefinger promised [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]]. Cersei has a dozen knights and 100 men-at-arms, enough to overwhelm his household guard. Littlefinger then points out there are lords that have no love for the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] that have guards. Ned states they are not enough\xe2\x80\x94he needs Littlefinger to secure him the [[City Watch of King\'s Landing]]. Littlefinger insists that when the Hand proclaims one king and the Queen another, the Gold Cloaks will side with the one who pays better. With that in mind, Littlefinger states that he will meet with City Watch Commander [[Janos Slynt]] with a bribe of 6,000 [[Currency|gold dragons]].\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/09/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-23 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/048/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 48, Eddard]]\n\n==References and Notes==\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 47]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Eddard Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 47]]\n[[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\xad\xd0\xb4\xd0\xb4\xd0\xb0\xd1\x80\xd0\xb4 XIII]]</text>\n      <sha1>ie6fwcuxsiit3eawjsgglrodbwrqrlm</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Clash of Kings-Chapter 24</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5664</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166427</id>\n      <parentid>141529</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-23T20:49:47Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13354">{{Infobox Chapter ACfK\n| pov\t\t= [[Theon Greyjoy]]\n| place         = [[Pyke]]\n| title\t\t= Theon II\n| page\t\t= 277\n| previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 23|Jon III]]\n| current\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 24|Theon II]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 25|Tyrion VI]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 11|Theon I]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 37|Theon III]]\n}}\n   \n[[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] is admiring his new longship when an ironborn woman calling herself Esgred interrupts him. His is taken by her and responds to his flirtations. He offers her a ride to the castle. As they proceed, Theon notes that the people they pass are finally showing him some respect. The arrive at [[Pyke]] where he learns she is his sister [[Asha Greyjoy]]. At the feast, Asha has the seat to the right of Lord [[Balon Greyjoy]], not him. He later joins his uncles and father in the planning to learn that he has been given the least important mission.\n\n==Synopsis==   \n[[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] is admiring the new longship his father gave him. It is not as large as the [[Great Kraken]] or [[Iron Victory]], but looks fast, has 50 oars, and will handle 100 men. He is interrupted by a striking ironborn woman calling herself Esgred, daughter of [[Ambrode]], wife to [[Sigrin]] the shipwright. Theon is taken by her, and tells her that that he has had women enough but none like her, adding that his cock has gone hard for her. She feels it, and tells him he is no liar. When he tells her it hurts fiercely, and she states poor lordling and claims to be newly with child. He tells her that this is all the better because he cannot get her pregnant, when this does not sway her he asks if she has ever had a prince, and how she can tell her children when she is wrinkled and gray she had a king. He next asks if he should name his ship after her, keep her in a tower with only jewels to wear like a princess of song. She tells him that he she build his ship, so he should name it after her. He tells her that Sigrin is wasted on her, and she tells him that Sirgin said the ship was wasted on him. Theon bristles, and learns she knows who he is. She then asks him what he thinks of the ship since Sigrin will want to know. Theon says he likes it and asks if it is as fast as it looks. She tells him that she is faster if the master knows how to handle her. Theon admits it\xe2\x80\x99s been a few years since he sailed a ship, and acknowledges to himself that he never captained on, but he is a [[House Greyjoy|Greyjoy]] so the sea is in his blood. When Theon states he would never mistreat such a fair maiden, Esgred states she is a sea bitch. Theon then states that he will call his ship Sea Bitch. When she reproachfully states he was going to name the ship after her, he tells her he did. Then he asks her to come on board so they can bless the ship with the milk of their loins. She tells him that the Drowned God may not take kindly to this sacrilege; the next day Theon\xe2\x80\x99s uncle [[Aeron Greyjoy|Aeron]] is to bless the ship to the Drowned God with seawater. Theon replies:\n{{Quote|Bugger the Drowned God. If he troubles us, I\xe2\x80\x99ll drown him again. We\xe2\x80\x99re off to war within a fortnight. Would you send me into battle all sleepless with longing?}}\nWhen she still refuses, Theon states his ship is well named. She touches his crotch as she asks if he will steer with this. He asks if she would come back to [[Pyke]] with him to the feast (he does not tell her that Lord [[Balon Greyjoy]] is having a feast every night while waiting for his captains to arrive). She teases him some more, even unlacing his breaches. She tells him she has not horse and finally she agrees to ride with him on his horse back to Pyke, refusing to ride Theon\xe2\x80\x99s squire\xe2\x80\x99s horse since the squire would have to walk.\n\nAs they walk back to the inn in [[Lordsport]] to get Theon\xe2\x80\x99s horse, Theon notices that the people grew very quiet as they pass and acknowledged them with bows; it is about time. Many of those in the town were the men of Lord [[Gorold Goodbrother]] of [[Great Wyk]] who had just arrived with 40 ships. As they pass Theon thinks how busy [[Otter Gimpknee]]\xe2\x80\x99s whorehouse will be, and that his companion was more to his taste.\n\nThe woman asks Theon about his crew. As they pass, she calls to [[Bluetooth]], and Theon learns that he has his own ship. Theon thinks long it has been, and any friends he had were now strangers. He tells her that his uncle [[Victarion Greyjoy]] has loaned his steersman [[Rymolf Stormdrunk]]. She calls also to [[Uller]], [[Qarl the Maid|Qarl]] and [[Skyte]], and they learn that Skyte\xe2\x80\x99s brother [[Eldiss]] is dead. They pass the ship [[Myraham]], which could not leave because Lord Balon was not allowing any ships to leave. As they do the girl on board calls to Theon, and he has to admit to Esgred that he had slept with the he did even though she was soft and bland, but there was no other woman on board.\n\nAt the inn, his squire [[Wex Pyke ]] ignores Theon\xe2\x80\x99s call, and so Theon had to grab him by the ear from a dicing table; Theon liked having Wex as a squire because he was born dumb. When Wex sees Esgred, his eyes go wide. Theon sends him to saddle the horses, Theon\xe2\x80\x99s horse [[Smiler]] being an impressive beast that he had purchased from Lord [[Sawane Botley]]; the Iron Islanders tend to be indifferent riders, and the horse had proven too much for Lord Botley and he was happy to sell, Wex being part of the deal. Theon was happy to be able to find a good war horse, not wanting to go to war without one. Esgred is impressed. Theon mounts and pulls Esgred in front of him. \n\nAs they ride he puts his hand on her breasts, but she removes them each time, finally ensuring he cannot put it again on her breast. When she asks if his father will welcome her, and he tells her that he hardly welcomed his heir. She tells him that there are his uncles and his sister. He tells her that his sister wears a mail hauberk with boiled leather small cloths, has a nose like a vulture, pimples, and no breasts. He will marry her off if someone will take her. She then asks about his uncles. Theon knows that his uncle are a threat to his inheritance since an uncle deposing of a weak nephew had happened in the Iron Islands; Theon does not believe he is weak, and will be stronger by the time his father dies. He tells her that [[Aeron]] only cares for his god, and Victarion is strong and tireless and dutiful. She mentions that [[Euron Greyjoy]] has no lack of cunning, and Theon replies he has not been seen for two years and may be dead; he and his ship [[Silence]] with its black sails and dark red hull were infamous. Esgred admits that he may be dead, and if he is alive he would be half a stranger, and the Ironborn would not seat a stranger on the [[Seastone Chair]]. The idea that the Ironborn would not make a stranger king bothers Threon since he is more of a stranger than Euron, but he does have time to prove himself.\n\nTheon mentions that he will be seated on the dais with his father, but will ensure that [[Helya]] will provide an honored spot for her. He will come down to join her when his father leaves\xe2\x80\x94he has no belly for drink. She states that it is a grievous when a great man grows old and Theon replies that Balon is but the father of a great man. She then asks what she will wear and Theon tells her that one of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s gowns might fit; she is in [[Harlaw]]. Esgred then asks if he will visit his mother since she is only a day\xe2\x80\x99s sail away, and Theon replies that his father relies on him, and maybe when peace comes. Theon again tries to seduce her, and she resists and asks about [[Winterfell]]. He obliges, surprised with some of what he told her.\n\nWhen they reach the castle, hounds assail them as Theon helps Esgred off. When the stableboy arrives, Theon tells him to get the horse and to get the damn dogs away. Instead the stableboy, smiling calls the woman \xe2\x80\x9c[[Asha Greyjoy|Asha]], stating she is back. She tells the stableboy how she arrived with Lord Goodbrother and stayed at the inn the previous night. Theon gapes at her as she tells him the pimples disappeared when the breast came, but she still has the vulture\xe2\x80\x99s beak. She tells him that she did not tell him who she was because she wanted to see who he was first. She excuses herself saying she wonders if she still ahves chainmail gown to wear over her boiled leather smallcloths. Wex is smirking at him, so he hits the boy twice.\n\nBack in his cold chambers, despite the braziers, he thinks how Asha made a fool of him, and enjoyed it and even undid his breaches. He now has no place here because of her. When he finally hears the distanct music he knows it is time to go. He chooses plain clothes with no jewelry\xe2\x80\x94he has no jewelry bought with iron, which irritates him, his cursed luck that he has only killed the poor.\n\nHe enters the hall to find with near 400 lords and captains; all the houses present except for [[House Stonehouse]] and [[House Drumm]]. This includes [[House Harlaw]], [[House Blacktyde]], [[House Sparr]], [[House Merlyn]], and [[House Goodbrother]], [[House Saltcliffe]], [[House Sunderly]], [[House Botley]] and [[House Wynch]]. Along with the drinking there were the dancers doing the finger dance where spinning axes often took fingers. Theon arrives at the dais to find his uncles to his father\xe2\x80\x99s right and Asha to his left. He father tells him he is late. When he sits at the seat next to Asha, he hisses to her that she is in his seat and she replies that his place is in Winterfell, and asks where his pretty cloths are. He replies that her hauberk must have rusted away. When a thrall arrives to serve wine or beer, she asks if he still has a taste for her mother\xe2\x80\x99s milk. When Theon asks if every word she told him was a lie, she says not. She calls to one of the dancers, [[Rolfe]], who throws an axe to her, which she catches handedly, and splits Theon\xe2\x80\x99s trencher with it (it splashes his mantle), telling him the axe is her husband. Then she pulls a dirk from between her breasts, and tells him this is her suckling babe. The hall is suddenly ringing with laughter, and Theon realizes it is at him. She then tells him that if he had troubled to learn anything about Sigrin she could not have fooled him; why should men fight and die for him when he knows nothing and no one in the islands. He replies that he is their prince. She tells him that it might be true by the laws of the green lands, but the Ironborn make their own laws.\n\nFinally Lord Balon rises and tells those on the dais to join him in his solar when they are finished. He leaves and then his brothers follow. Theon is rising to leave and Asha asks him why he is in such a rush since his father has been waiting for him for years, but if he fears, scurry after him. Theon sits back annoyed saying he runs after no man. She tells him no man but every woman. He replies this it was not me who grabbed your cock, and replies she does not have one. He tells her that he is a man with natural hungers, and asks what sort of unnatural creature is she. She tells him she is only a shy maid and gives his cock a squeeze under the table. With that Theon stumbles to find his father.\n\nTheon arrives in the damp, drafty solar to find his father before the brazier buried under sealskin robes, his uncles on either side. On seeing him arrive, his father tells him it is time he heard his plans, and rudely shuts him up when he states he has suggestions. He first tells Theon that he will command 8 ships that will harry the [[Stony Shore]] and will be accompanied by Aeron and Dagmer. Theon feels slapped, being sent to do reaver\xe2\x80\x99s work, burning the houses of fishermen and his father did not even trust him sufficiently, sending Aeron and Dagmer with him. Balon tells Asha, who had just slipped in, that she will take 30 ships with picked men to take the castle at [[Deepwood Motte]]. Asha states that she always wanted a castle while Theon thinks that is should have been him given this task since he had been there several times. Victorion gets the main thrust at [[Moat Cailin]], sailing up the [[Saltspear]] and the [[Fever River]]. Once they hold Moat Cailin, [[Robb Stark]], the pup, will not be able to go back north. Theon tries to tell Balon that the lords hold the castles, but again Balon shuts him up, saying the lords have gone south with the pup. Winterfell may hold out for a year, but the rest shall be theirs.\n\nOn the rope bridge, a sudden gust of wind causes him to stumble to his knees. Asha is there to help him up and guide him across the rest of the bridge, telling him he cannot hold his wine either. Theon tells her he liked her better as Esgred, and she tells him she liked him better when he was nine.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n*Analyses and summary of the chapter [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2011/10/re-read-theon-ii-keeping-up-appearances.html in the course of a 10th reread] by Slynt. \n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/03/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-12 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 24]]    \n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Theon Greyjoy]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Pyke]]\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 24]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 25, Theon]]</text>\n      <sha1>ib9gzbp24epa7avy1rzhg7p0u52kmf4</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 7</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6813</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>184418</id>\n      <parentid>166542</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-05-25T21:12:28Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Dancing Maester</username>\n        <id>6281</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <minor/>\n      <comment>/* Synopsis */</comment>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4047">{{Infobox Chapter ADwD\n| pov\t\t= [[Jon Snow]]\n| place         = [[Castle Black]]\n| title\t\t= Jon II\n| page\t\t= 95\n| previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 6|The Merchant\'s Man]]\n| current\t= Jon II\n| next\t\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 8|Tyrion III]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 3|Jon I]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 10|Jon III]]\n}}\n\nThis chapter covers the events of [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 5|Chapter 5 of \'\'A Feast for Crows\'\']], but from [[Jon Snow|Jon\'s]] perspective rather than [[Samwell Tarly]]\'s.\n\n==Synopsis==\nJon summons Gilly and, despite his own misgivings, forces her to give up her own child and take [[Mance Rayder]]\'s baby away with her, disguised as her own. Gilly is distraught, but Jon tells her that [[Melisandre]] will burn the child for the purposes of a spell, as Mance was [[King-Beyond-The-Wall]] and the blood of kings has magical powers. Jon warns her that if Mance\'s son is burned her own will die as well. She leaves wordlessly.\n\nSoon after, Sam arrives. After a brief discussion regarding what they know of [[the Others]] and how to stop such monsters, Jon breaks the news that he is sending Sam to the [[Citadel]] so he can train to become a maester and replace Maester [[Aemon Targaryen (son of Maekar I)|Aemon]]. Sam will travel by sea from [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea|Eastwatch]], along with Gilly, the baby, and Maester Aemon. Sam leaves him, distraught, while Jon remembers something Maester Aemon told him when he became Lord Commander of the Night\'s Watch:\n{{Quote|You will have little joy of your command, but I think you have the strength in you to do the things that must be done. Kill the boy, Jon Snow. Winter is almost upon us. Kill the boy and let the man be born.}} Jon makes his inspection of Castle Black, during which he hears a report from [[Dywen]] and [[Kedge Whiteye]] that two of the [[queen\'s men]], Ser [[Richard Horpe]] and Ser [[Justin Massey]], were seen riding off to the south.\n\nThe next morning, Jon wakes early to see off Sam, Gilly, and Maester Aemon, as they depart for Eastwatch. He then meets with ranger [[Bedwyck]]. Jon tells Bedwyck that he is putting a garrison in the abandoned way-castle [[Icemark]] and giving him command of it. Both of them assert the danger of wildlings climbing over and creating a toehold for the rest, referring to [[Raymun Redbeard]] having done just that to bypass the wall. Jon says he is intending to garrison all of the castles on [[the Wall]], but for the time being, only Icemark and Greyguard. When he learns that [[Janos Slynt]] is to command Greyguard, Bedwyck urges Jon to choose someone more trustworthy.\n\n[[File:Small Justice for Ned.jpg|thumb|350px|left|Art by acazigot]]\nHalf the morning passes before Lord Janos reports as commanded, escorted by [[Kegs]] and [[Eddison Tollett|Dolorous Edd]]. Jon tells him that he is giving him command of [[Greyguard]] (partly in light of Slynt\'s years commanding the City Watch, but primarily to separate Slynt from [[Alliser Thorne]] and end their scheming), but Slynt curses him and storms out. The next morning, Jon finds Slynt breaking his fast in the common room and announces that he is giving Slynt one last chance to drop his spoon and report to the stables to depart for Greyguard. After Slynt refuses him again and mocks him in front of his men and Stannis\' men, Jon instructs [[Iron Emmett]] and Edd to take Slynt to the Wall and hang him. As Slynt is being dragged out, Jon changes his mind and orders a block brought so he can behead Slynt himself with [[Longclaw]]. With his head on the block, Slynt desperately begs Jon for mercy. Jon refuses and carries out the execution. Watching from the steps of the [[King\'s Tower]], Stannis meets Jon\'s eyes and nods briefly in approval.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 07]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Jon Snow]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Castle Black]]\n\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 7]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 08, Jon]]</text>\n      <sha1>li13lj8xybu8oceqsxom23ns0hheuxt</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 60</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5815</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>134305</id>\n      <parentid>122049</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2014-06-27T15:21:27Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Nittanian</username>\n        <id>3504</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <minor/>\n      <comment>dwarfs</comment>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4254">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]]\n| title\t\t= Tyrion VIII\n| place         = [[King\'s Landing]]\n| page\t\t= 667\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 59|Sansa IV]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 60|Tyrion VIII]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 61|Sansa V]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 58|Tyrion VII]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 66|Tyrion IX]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] puzzles out how [[Joffrey Baratheon|his nephew]] must have found [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]]\xe2\x80\x99s Valyrian dagger amongst [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]]\xe2\x80\x99s possessions, assuming that the king had probably forgotten he even owned it. Joffrey must then have paid some unsavory freerider to open [[Bran Stark|Bran]]\xe2\x80\x99s throat, though Tyrion still cannot figure out why, attributing it to Joffrey\'s innate cruelty for the moment. Tyrion is slightly drunk while Joffrey and [[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]] are wed in the [[Great Sept of Baelor]], and continues to drink until night falls and it is time for the great wedding feast. As they enter the ballroom, [[Olenna Redwyne|Olenna]], the Queen of Thorns, comes over to tell Sansa how beautiful she looks, and the old lady straightens out the hairnet that [[Dontos Hollard|Dontos]] gave her. Many at the wedding offer their condolences to Sansa on the loss of [[Catelyn Tully|her mother]] and [[Robb Stark|brother]]; watching his wife\'s courteous and friendly nature to the other guests, Tyrion muses she would have made Joffrey a great queen and wife if he\'d had the sense to love her, something Tyrion believes his nephew incapable of.\n\nDuring the feast, Joffrey calls for the royal jousters, and the party is entertained as two dwarfs battle each other. Joffrey then mocks his uncle, commanding Tyrion to fight the dwarfs as the king\xe2\x80\x99s champion. Tyrion rebuffs him, but the King dumps a huge goblet of wine over Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s head. Joffrey commands Tyrion to serve him wine, and the hall erupts in laughter. Tyrion refills the goblet, and then the pigeon pie is brought out, and Joffrey calls for Ser [[Ilyn Payne|Ilyn\xe2\x80\x99s]] sword. Sansa is horrified to learn that the King\xe2\x80\x99s Justice no longer holds her father\xe2\x80\x99s greatsword, [[Ice]]. \n\nJoffrey calls for more wine, Margaery at his side, and then begins to eat some of Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s pie. He commands Tyrion to serve him more wine, which Tyrion does.  The King then begins to cough, unable to breathe as he claws at his throat. Lady Olenna and Margaery call out for help, but the [[Kingsguard]] are powerless to do anything. As Grand Maester [[Pycelle]] calls for his potions, Tyrion dumps the rest of the wine out on the floor, and Joffrey, now turning black, seems to either reach for--or point at--his uncle. [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] has slipped off during the confusion, but when [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] finally lets go of her son\xe2\x80\x99s lifeless body, she commands the Kingsguard to arrest Tyrion for murdering the King.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n*[[Petyr Baelish]] Littlefinger\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n*[[Bran Stark]]\n*[[Margaery Tyrell]]\n*[[Olenna Redwyne]]\n*[[Dontos Hollard]]\n*[[Catelyn Stark]]\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Ilyn Payne]]\n*[[Pycelle]]\n*[[Sansa Stark]]\n*[[Cersei Lannister]]\n*[[Garlan Tyrell]]\n}}\t\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Valyrian]]\n*[[Freerider]]\n*[[Great Sept of Baelor]]\n*[[Ice]]\n*[[Kingsguard]]\n}}\n\n\n==References and Notes==\n*The synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/07/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-36 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Part 36].

There is no sign of the two [[dragon]]s: they do not like the rain any more than men. [[Quentyn Martell]] is dead; it took three days for him to die. Out of respect for the prince, Ser Barristan had him placed in [[Daenerys Targaryen|the queen\'s]] bed, the same one he crossed half the world to reach. [[Missandei]] is the only one he could get to help tend Quentyn, for none of the cupbearers were willing and the [[Blue Graces]] never responded to his summons; he suspects the [[pale mare]] has carried them off. Missandei asks what is to be done with Quentyn\'s body and Barristan replies that they will find a way to send him back to [[Dorne]], though he is unsure how. \n\nHe advises Missandei to get some sleep and she urges him to do the same as she has noted that he doesn\'t sleep very much. Barristan privately thinks it is not just needing less sleep than a younger man, as [[Grand Maester]] [[Pycelle]] once told him, but having reached the age where he fears to close his eyes in case he never opens them again; Barristan does not consider dying in his sleep a death worthy of a knight of the [[Kingsguard]]. For a brief moment, he wonders if Daenerys is dead, but then dismisses the thought, though he notes that each time it becomes harder to convince himself his queen is still alive.\n\nAt dawn, [[Skahaz mo Kandaq]] comes to speak with him; Skahaz is already aware that Quentyn is dead, and he informs Barristan that the [[Galazza Galare|Green Grace]], who Barristan sent to treat with the [[Yunkai\'i]] to make them release the hostages, has not returned to the city. In addition, while the city is secure, an angry mob is gathered outside the pyramid demanding [[Hizdahr zo Loraq|Hizdahr]]\'s release and that both dragons be destroyed, and since his arrest, the [[Sons of the Harpy]] have resumed their nightly murders with a vengeance; Barristan is shocked to learn they have killed twenty nine in the night, in contrast to nine the previous night and three the night before. However, despite Skahaz\'s insistence, Barristan still refuses to kill the hostages in retaliation.\n\nThe Shavepate tells Barristan (who is now the Queen\'s [[Hand of the King|Hand]], as head of a council ruling the city) that the council is waiting for him. Barristan does not want the position, but in the absence of Daenerys, he doesn\'t trust any of the others to rule. [[Grey Worm]] and the captains of the [[Stalwart Shields]], [[Mother\'s Men]] and [[Free Brothers]], along with [[Strong Belwas]] are present. Barristan informs them of Quentyn\'s death; most of the council express contempt for the prince\'s actions and many want his companions, who are at present imprisoned, executed for unleashing the dragons on the city. The fighting pits are to remain closed, for fear that the noise and smell of blood will attract the dragons, though [[Marselen]] suggests reopening the pits in the hope it lures [[Drogon]] back, and Daenerys with him. For the time being, the pits are packed full of livestock, from which the dragons are feeding regularly, and thus far, there has been no further evidence of either Viserion or Rhaegal eating people.\n\nThe council are convinced that the Yunkai\'i are never going to accept any terms beside the killing of both dragons for the return of the hostages. When asked what he will do when his terms are refused, Barristan replies &quot;Fire and Blood&quot;. They quickly grasp his meaning; he intends to do battle with the Yunkish army. A lengthy discussion regarding the battle plan follows, particularly regarding the deployment of troops, targets to attack, how best to use the [[Unsullied]] and other such concerns; however, all agree that if they can destroy the slavers, the [[sellsword]] companies will abandon their paymasters, and the dragons may make their presence known in the fight, though Barristan cannot say if they will help or just kill indiscriminately, though he does note that if they come, it will help break Yunkish morale.\n\nWhen the council adjourns, Barristan goes to the cell where the two Dornishmen are being held and informs them of Prince Quentyn\'s death. [[Gerris Drinkwater]] angrily blames Daenerys for it, causing a fierce argument between him and Barristan, who bluntly dismisses Gerris\'s claims Quentyn came for love and asserts they came because [[Doran Martell|Quentyn\'s father]] wanted the backing of [[House Targaryen]] before daring to defy the [[Iron Throne]], but [[Archibald Yronwood]] angrily tells Gerris to shut up before more can be said. Barristan then makes an arrangement with the two [[Dornishmen]]; in exchange for a ship back to Dorne and Quentyn\'s bones to return to his father, Barristan wants them to go back to the [[Windblown]] company and tell the [[Tattered Prince]] that they will give him what he wants (namely [[Pentos]]) if he can free and protect the hostages during the attack. \n\nThe Green Grace returns, telling Barristan that the Yunkai\'i have refused his offer, and that the only price they will accept is the death of the dragons. As they speak, the Shavepate runs in and tells them that the six trebuchets have begun flinging not rocks, but corpses into [[Meereen]].\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Barristan Selmy]]\n*[[Quentyn Martell]]\n*[[Missandei]]\n*[[Skahaz mo Kandaq]]\n*[[Marselen]]\n*[[Symon Stripeback]]\n*[[Grey Worm]]\n*[[Tal Toraq]]\n*[[Jokin]]\n*[[Widower]]\n*[[Rommo]]\n*[[Goghor the Giant]]\n*[[Belaquo Bonebreaker]]\n*[[Camarron of the Count]]\n*[[Spotted Cat]]\n*[[Belwas]]\n*[[Tumco Lho|Tum]]\n*The [[Red Lamb]]\n*[[Archibald Yronwood]]\n*[[Gerris Drinkwater]]\n*[[Bhakaz]]\n*[[Grazhar zo Galare]]\n*[[Azzak]]\n*[[Viserion]]\n*[[Galazza Galare]]\n*[[Kezmya]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Rhaegal]]\n*[[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n*Grand Maester [[Pycelle]]\n*[[Hizdahr zo Loraq]]\n*[[Harghaz]]\n*[[Mollono Yos Dob]]\n*[[Daario Naharis]]\n*[[Aggo]]\n*[[Rakharo]]\n*[[Drogon]]\n*[[Harghaz]]\n*[[Hero]]\n*[[Jhogo]]\n*[[Petyr Baelish]]\n*[[Varys]]\n*[[Doran Martell]]\n*[[Cletus Yronwood]]\n*[[Willam Wells]]\n*The [[Tattered Prince]]\n*[[Caggo]]\n*[[Meris]]\n*[[Hugh Hungerford]]\n*[[Dick Straw]]\n*[[Aerys II Targaryen]]\n*[[The Harpy]]\n|}\n\n==Places and Terms Mentioned==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[Dorne]]\n*[[Meereen]]\n*[[Great Pyramid]]\n*[[Naath]]\n*[[Slaver\'s Bay]]\n*[[Trident]]\n*[[Seven Kingdoms]]\n*[[Dothraki Sea]]\n*[[Yunkai]]/The Yellow City\n*[[Summer Islands]]\n*[[Daznak\'s Pit]]\n*[[Pit of Ghrazz]]\n*[[Golden Pit]]\n*[[Westeros]]\n*[[Skahazadhan]]\n*[[Sunspear]]\n*[[Astapor]]\n*[[Pentos]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[Duskendale]]\n*[[Harvest Hall]]\n*[[Tolos]]\n*[[Qarth]]\n*[[Ghis]]\n*[[Valyria]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[House of Hazkar]]\n*[[House of Yherizan]]\n*[[Dragon]]\n*[[Blue Graces]]\n*[[Bloody flux|Pale mare]]\n*[[Silent Sisters]]\n*[[Battle of the Trident]]\n*[[Maesters#Grand Maester|Grand Maester]]\n*[[Kingsguard]]\n*[[Hand of the King|Hand of the Queen]]\n*[[Green Grace]]\n*[[Wise Masters]]\n*[[Sellsword]]\n*[[Unsullied]]\n*[[Tokar]]\n*[[Great Masters]]\n*[[House of Uhlez]]\n*[[Sons of the Harpy]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[Brazen Beasts]]\n*[[Mother\'s Men]]\n*[[Free Brothers]]\n*[[Stalwart Shields]]\n*[[Unsullied]]\n*[[Stormcrows]]\n*\'\'[[khalasar]]\'\'\n*\'\'[[jaqqa rhan]]\'\'\n*[[Fighting pits|Pit fighters]]\n*[[Dothraki]]\n*[[Iron Throne]]\n*[[House Targaryen]]\n*[[Faith of the Seven|The Seven]]\n*[[Windblown]]\n*[[White Book]]\n*[[Pink Graces]]\n*[[Poisoned locusts]]\n|}\n\n{{Stub}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 70]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Barristan Selmy]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Meereen]]\n\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 70]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 71, La Main de la reine]]</text>\n      <sha1>9ljw2w414c51z6a40lfqmocfw2mmpsg</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Feast for Crows-Chapter 43</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5983</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166974</id>\n      <parentid>161543</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-06-05T19:28:17Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6363">{{Infobox Chapter AFfC\n| pov\t\t= [[Cersei Lannister]]\n| title\t\t= Cersei X\n| place         = [[King\'s Landing]]\n| page\t\t= 642\n| previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 42|Brienne VIII]]\n| current\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 43|Cersei X]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 44|Jaime VII]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 39|Cersei IX]]\n}}\n==Synopsis==\n\nAccompanied by six newly reinstated [[Warrior\'s Sons]], Septa [[Moelle]] brings word to the court that Queen [[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]] and her cousins have been imprisoned at the [[Great Sept of Baelor]] for adultery and high treason. The Septa reveals that Margaery\'s maidenhead is not intact. Grand Maester [[Pycelle]] also reluctantly discloses to the Septa that Margaery has had him mix [[moon tea]] on many occasions. Leaving the throne room confident that Margaery was finished, [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] agrees with [[Aurane Waters]]\' request to launch his new dromonds, in case Lord [[Mace Tyrell]] decides to march on [[King\'s Landing]] to save his daughter. Lord [[Orton Merryweather]] remarks that the High Septon may want to try Margaery himself, as the Faith used to do. Cersei hopes he is right.\n         \nCersei has [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] sign some blank warrants, which she then affixes names to. Summoning Ser [[Osfryd Kettleblack|Osfryd]], she orders him to arrest Ser [[Tallad]], the [[Blue Bard]], [[Hugh Clifton]], [[Mark Mullendore]], as well as the [[House Redwyne|Redwyne]] twins whom she wants to be found innocent of the charges of bedding Margaery. The next morning, Cersei and [[Taena of Myr|Taena]] are carried by litter to the Great Sept. On the way, Lady Merryweather inquires, &quot;What if Margaery demands that her innocence be determined by battle?&quot; Cersei smiles, and replies that she must be championed by a knight of the [[Kingsguard]], but since Ser [[Osmund Kettleblack|Osmund]] is brother to one of her accusers, that leaves only Ser [[Meryn Trant]] and Ser [[Boros Blount]]. Cersei states that the former will not be feeling well when the time comes. Within the Sept, the High Septon grants Cersei permission to visit her good-daughter, while Taena goes to speak with Margaery\'s cousins.\nMargaery is beside herself, stripped of her clothes and dignity, while she is asked once an hour to confess her fornication. Cersei tells her that she has rounded up all those that Ser Osney named, lying that they will reveal her innocence. When Cersei says that a sworn brother of the Kingsguard will fight for her should it come to a trial by combat, Margaery demands that her own brother, Ser [[Garlan Tyrell|Garlan the Gallant]], be summoned to fight in place of the grievously injured Ser [[Loras Tyrell|Loras]]. Cersei would never allow this to happen; and Margaery, well aware of Cersei\'s intentions, tells her to leave, calling her a vile, scheming, evil bitch.\n\nCersei is then escorted deep beneath [[Visenya\'s hill|Visenya\'s Hill]] to speak with the High Septon. He tells her that seven will sit in judgment of Margaery and her cousins, as the Faith did in yore, before King [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen]] stripped them of this power. When Cersei asks to have Ser Osney released into her custody, the priest flatly denies her. Chained to the ceiling of his cell, Osney has been brutally whipped. Infuriated, Cersei tells the High Septon that Osney came of his own free will. The holy man responds, &quot;I have heard many men confess, but seldom have I heard a man so pleased to be so guilty... The more diligently we applied the scourge, the more Ser Osney\'s offenses seemed to change. He would now have us believe that he never touched Margaery Tyrell.&quot; When asked now if he had carnal knowledge of the queen, Osney points at Cersei, saying, &quot;Aye. That one there.&quot; Furthermore, he confesses that Cersei ordered him to kill the old High Septon. Upon hearing this, Cersei bolts from the cell, racing headlong through the Great Sept. Fearing what may happen should the Faith question Taena Merryweather, she is soon overtaken by a group of septas, who strip her and confine her to a grim cell.\n\nHer screams going unheard, Cersei begins to shiver from the cold. Every time she begins to fall asleep, she is jostled awake and asked if she will confess her sins. After two days of this torture, [[Qyburn]] enters her cell. She begs him to take her home, but the de-chained maester tells her it will not be allowed and she will be tried for murder, treason, and fornication. He reveals that Margaery will be tried by the same court, and that he delivered the Blue Bard to the High Septon, but despite the Faith\'s torture, &quot;he is still singing the same sweet song we taught him&quot;. Qyburn then informs her of the rapid changes made since her fall: the realm is now being governed by Ser [[Harys Swyft]] and Pycelle; they removed Ser Osfryd as Commander of the gold cloaks and Qyburn from the small council (though he still works for them thanks to his control of [[Varys]]\' whisperers); Lord Orton and Taena have fled to [[Longtable]], while Ser [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]] has been sent for to take over the Regency. Perhaps worst of all, Aurane Waters unshipped his oars and sailed the fleet, possibly to join Lord [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]; while Lord Mace Tyrell and Lord [[Randyll Tarly]] are marching on [[King\'s Landing]].\n\nDespite Qyburn\'s words that his unbeatable &quot;champion&quot; is ready, Cersei knows that only a Kingsguard can defend her in a trial by combat. She has Qyburn pen her final plea to her brother: &quot;Come at once. Help me. Save me. I need you as I have never needed you before. I love you, I love you, I love you. Come at once.&quot;\n\n==References and Notes== \n*The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/09/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-feast-for-crows-part-31 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Feast for Crows, Part 31].

Catelyn delays [[catspaw|the assassin]] long enough for Bran\'s [[direwolf]] to arrive and kill the assassin. Catelyn is now convinced Bran did not fall, but was pushed.\n\n==Synopsis==\nEight days after [[Eddard Stark|Eddard]] and the others have left [[Winterfell]], [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] is still sitting at [[Bran Stark|Bran\'s]] bedside in her fragile mental state. [[Maester]] [[Luwin]] comes to tell her how much [[Robert I Baratheon|the king\'s]] visit has cost them, but Catelyn is not interested in looking at figures. Regardless, the maester continues to speak of replacing provisions. Catelyn insists that the steward can worry about such matters. Luwin reminds her that [[Vayon Poole]] went south with Lord Eddard and needs to be replaced, along with a number of other positions. Catelyn is outraged that he can think of such trivial things when Bran is dying until [[Robb Stark|Robb]] arrives to take charge of the appointments.\n\nAfter the maester leaves, Robb asks Catelyn what she thinks she\'s doing spending all her time with Bran and not even saying farewell to her own family. Catelyn insists she can\'t bear to be away from Bran, in case he should die. Robb assures her that Bran is not going to die and reminds her that her other children need her, too. He goes on to explain that [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]] just follows him around all day crying, thinking everyone has abandoned him. \n\nRobb hears a [[direwolf]] howling outside and opens the window, explaining that the sound seems to be good for Bran. When the other direwolves join in, Catelyn screams for Robb to make the noise stop and then collapses to the floor. Robb helps her up but she only begins screaming again. Then Robb notices the dogs barking as well and sees the library tower afire.\n\nWhile Robb rushes off to fight the fire, Catelyn remains behind with Bran. When she turns away from the window, however, she is face-to-face with [[Catspaw|a filthy man]] brandishing [[Valyrian steel dagger|a knife]]. The man claims that Catelyn was not supposed to be there and moves towards Bran, claiming that killing him would be a mercy. Catelyn attempts to scream for help, but the man is too quick as he moves to slit her throat. Catelyn manages to grab the blade with her hands and push it away, cutting her fingers badly. She bites the man\'s hand and fights her way free. The man is about to attack her again when Bran\'s direwolf leaps onto him and rips out his throat. Once the man is dead, the direwolf settles down on Bran\'s bed.\n\n[[File:Chris Dien bran saved.jpg|left|350px|thumb|Bran\'s wolf rescues Catelyn.]]\n\nCatelyn is taken back to her chambers. [[Old Nan]] undresses her and helps her into a bath. After the bath, Maester Luwin dresses Catelyn\'s wounds: her fingers are cut almost to the bone and the man had pulled out a handful of hair. The maester gives her milk of the poppy, which puts her to sleep. She wakes up four days later. It seems like a nightmare, but the pain in her hands reminds her that it was real. When Catelyn remembers her behavior since Bran\'s fall she is ashamed, promising herself that it will not happen again. \n\nRobb, now wearing armor and a sword, comes to see her with [[Theon Greyjoy]], Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]], and [[Hallis Mollen]], the new [[House Stark guards|captain of the guard]]. Hal tells her that nobody knows who the man was, but he had likely been lurking in the stables since the king\'s visit. Where the man had been hiding they found ninety [[currency|silver stags]] hidden under the straw. When Robb asks why anybody would want to kill Bran, Catelyn insists that as a [[lord]] he must learn to answer his own questions. Robb guesses that somebody is afraid of what Bran might do or say if he wakes up and so posts a heavy guard on Bran.\n\nRodrik points out that the dagger used by the assassin, a [[Valyrian steel]] blade with a [[dragonbone]] handle, is a much finer weapon than anything the low-born footpad should have possessed; someone must have given it to him. Catelyn then tells Rodrik, Theon, and Robb in strict confidence of her sister [[Lysa Arryn|Lysa\'s]] suspicions about the death of [[Jon Arryn]]. She reminds them that [[Jaime Lannister]] did not go hunting with the others the day Bran fell, and that she does not believe that Bran fell, but that he was pushed. The group admits that this is a reasonable conclusion. \n\nHowever, Maester Luwin points out that all they have is conjecture, and that they must have proof or else keep silent. After some deliberation, Catelyn decides that she and Rodrik will go to [[King\'s Landing]] by ship to inform Eddard, hopefully arriving ahead of the king\xe2\x80\x99s party.\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Bran Stark]]\n*[[Catelyn Stark]]\n*[[Hallis Mollen]]\n*[[Luwin]]\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Old Nan]]\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n*[[catspaw]]\n*[[Rodrik Cassel]]\n*[[Summer]]\n*[[Theon Greyjoy]]\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n*[[Grey Wind]]\n*[[Hodor]]\n*[[Hullen]]\n*[[Jaime Lannister]]\n*[[Jon Arryn]]\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Jory Cassel]]\n*[[Lysa Arryn]]\n*[[Rickon Stark]]\n*[[Sansa Stark]]\n*[[Shaggydog]]\n*[[Vayon Poole]]\n|}\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[King\'s Landing]]\n*[[Riverrun]]\n*[[White Harbor]]\n*[[White Knife]]\n*[[Winterfell]]\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[House Arryn]]\n*[[House Cassel]]\n*[[Direwolf]]\n*[[Dragonbone]]\n*[[House Greyjoy]]\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[Hand of the King]]\n*[[Kingsroad]]\n*[[House Lannister]]\n*[[Maester]]\n*[[House Mollen]]\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[Night\'s Watch]]\n*[[House Poole]]\n*[[House Stark]]\n*[[House Tully]]\n*[[Valyrian steel]]\n*[[Valyrian steel dagger]]\n|}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2009/05/catelyn-sansa.html Humorous review of the chapter]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/05/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-8 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/015/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{EnWikia|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 14|small=yes}}\n\n[[Category:A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 14]]\n[[Category:A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Catelyn Tully|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 14]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Winterfell]]\n\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 14]]\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 15, Catelyn]]\n[[pt:A Guerra dos Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 14]]\n[[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\x9a\xd0\xb5\xd0\xb9\xd1\x82\xd0\xb8\xd0\xbb\xd0\xb8\xd0\xbd III]]</text>\n      <sha1>cpk2qsztpx3ph86xpvw1ughtzblb9yf</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Game of Thrones-Chapter 32</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5997</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>165975</id>\n      <parentid>117257</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-17T14:17:03Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11578">{{Infobox Chapter AGoT\n| pov\t\t= [[Arya Stark]]\n| title\t\t= Arya III\n| place         = [[King\'s Landing]]\n| page\t\t= 284 (US bantam HC)\n| previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 31|Tyrion IV]]\n| current\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 32|Arya III]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 33|Eddard VIII]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 22|Arya II]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 50|Arya IV]]\n}} __NOTOC__\n\n[[Arya Stark|Arya]] is chasing a cat when [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]] and [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] discover her. She escapes unidentified, but finds herself in the dungeons. There she overhears two men talking about killing [[Eddard Stark|her father]]. After eventually finding her way out she tries to tell her father what she heard but he does not believe her.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Arya Stark|Arya]] is chasing a one-eared [[Balerion (cat)|black tomcat]] as part of her training with [[Syrio Forel]]. Arya has found that catching cats is hard; half-healed scratches cover her hands and her knees are scabbed from tumbles. At first, even the fat kitchen cat could avoid her. As she stalks the black tom, Arya recalls when she originally went to Syrio with her hand bleeding. He told her she was too slow and that her enemies would give her more than scratches. The castle is full of cats, all of which she has caught and brought to Syrio, except for this one, which a [[City Watch of King\'s Landing|gold cloak]] claimed was older than sin and twice as mean; it had even snatched a quail from Lord [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]\xe2\x80\x99s fingers once. Arya has chased the cat all over the castle and she does not know where she is, but she has finally cornered the cat in a narrow alley.\n\nThe tomcat tries to dart between her legs, but Arya catches it. As she excitedly hugs the cat to her chest and gives it a kiss, she is interrupted. Princess [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]], at the end of the alley, asks what \xe2\x80\x9cthat boy\xe2\x80\x9d is doing with that cat. With her are a couple of the Lannister household guards, a septa, and Prince [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]]. She asks again, and calls Arya a ragged boy, which Tommen agrees with. Arya pauses a moment to look at her ragged clothing (you don\xe2\x80\x99t wear silks and skirts when catching cats). To avoid being recognized, Arya falls to one knee. The septa tells her that she does not belong in this part of the castle. Arya is sure that as soon as she speaks the children will recognize her. The septa tells the guards to bring Arya to her. Arya panics and escapes the grasp of the guard, runs over the prince, and avoids the other guard. After a short chase, Arya sees a window above her, not much more that an arrow slit wide. She leaps up, grabs the sill, and pulls herself through, holding her breath to get through.\n\nArya continues her rush, ending up lost in a dark cellar and thinking of the trouble she will be in if she was recognized. After listening for a long time, she hears no pursuit. She remembers her nightmares of getting lost in the [[Red Keep]], even though her father had told her it was smaller than [[Winterfell]]. Arya plans to count to 10,000; by then it will be safe to come out. \n\nBy the time she reaches 87, Arya can make out the large shapes of monsters all around her. Initially she is afraid, but she soon overcomes her fear and makes her way over to touch one of the monsters. She can tell it is bone and that it is dead, but has a feeling that it knows she is there and that it does not love her. She backs into a larger one and whirls around, causing a tooth to rip her leather jerkin. She runs, avoiding a larger monster, and dashes through the jaws of another to find a door. She opens it enough to slip through into the even darker hall beyond. She remembers that a [[Water Dancer]] can see without eyes. As she proceeds down the hall by feeling the walls, Arya remembers that all hallways lead somewhere. Then she hears noises and sees a dim flickering light, which allows her to see that she is above a well with steps leading down. \n\n[[File:Red Keep Dragon Cellar by Kim Pope.jpg|300 px|left|thumb|The dragon cellar of the Red Keep.]]\n\nArya can see two men coming up the well and hears the echo of their voices, one of which is thick with the accent of the [[Free Cities]]. She quickly discovers that the men are talking about [[Eddard Stark|her father]] when one explains to the other that the [[Hand of the King|Hand]] will soon learn the truth. When the second man asks what the Hand will do with the truth, the first replies that only the gods know, because the Hand is not a man to put aside the attempt on [[Bran Stark|his son]]\xe2\x80\x99s life and that soon [[House Stark|the wolf]] and [[House Lannister|the lion]] will be at each other\xe2\x80\x99s throats. The other man insists that a war now would do no good because they are not ready.\n\nAs the men get nearer, Arya can see more of them. The one bearing the torch is fat with a scarred face and a stubble beard who moves quietly despite wearing heavy boots and a steel cap. Arya finds him [[Varys|oddly familiar]] but cannot recognize him. She is sure that she has never met the man with the accent. [[Illyrio|He]] has a forked beard and is grossly fat, yet moves lightly like a Water Dancer. \n\nWhen the torchbearer asks what he might possibly do to prevent a war, the fork-bearded man asks, \xe2\x80\x9cIf [[Jon Arryn|one Hand]] can die, why not a second?\xe2\x80\x9d The torchbearer insists that times have changed and that the current Hand is not like the other. The fork-bearded man insists that they need more time: [[Daenerys Targaryen|the princess]] is with child and the \'\'[[Drogo|khal]]\'\' will not bestir himself until his son is born. \n\nThe torchbearer insists that if the \'\'khal\'\' does not bestir himself soon it may be too late, because there are new players in the game. [[Stannis Baratheon]] and [[Lysa Arryn]] are rumored to be marshalling their strength, Lord [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]] and the [[Loras Tyrell|Knight of Flowers]] plan to make [[Margaery Tyrell]] King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]]\xe2\x80\x99s new queen, and no one knows what [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] is playing at. Yet the torchbearer insists that Eddard Stark worries him the most; he now has [[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms|the book]] and [[Gendry|the bastard]] and soon the truth. [[Catelyn Stark|His wife]] has also taken [[Tyrion Lannister|the Imp]] prisoner and [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] and Lord [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] will take this for an outrage.\n\nThe torchbearer claims that, even with his skill, he cannot keep control much longer, but does agree to do what he can, saying he requires more gold and 50 more \xe2\x80\x9cbirds.\xe2\x80\x9d The forked beard responds that 50 is a lot, given that they are so young to know their letters. He suggests that if they could keep their tongues it would be easier, but the torchbearer replies that the risk is too great.\n\nArya follows the two men for a long time, going deeper and deeper down the hall until dirt and timbers replace the dressed stone. After miles of following, the men are gone and Arya, blind and lost, can see no way to go but forward. At the end she is knee deep in stinking water, and eventually, she finds herself at the mouth of a sewer that empties into the river. She is so dirty and stinky that she removes her clothes and swims until she feels clean. When she looks around, Arya can see the Red Keep on its hill, miles away.\n\nWhen she finally reaches the gate to the Red Keep and asks to be let in, the two gold cloaks on guard sneer at her because she looks like a beggar. She tells them she is not a beggar, she lives there, and she wants to see her father. One of the guards jokes that he wants to fuck the queen for all the good it does him. When Arya insists her father is the Hand of the King, one of the guards tries to strike her, but she jumps away and insists she is Arya Stark and that if they lay a hand on her their heads will end up on spikes. She offers that if they need proof of who she is [[Jory Cassel]] or [[Vayon Poole]] can vouch for her. She finishes by asking the startled guardsmen if they will open the gate or need a clap on the head to improve their hearing.\n\n[[File:Yoren.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Yoren of the Night\'s Watch]]\n\nArya is brought to her father in his solar by [[Tomard]] and [[Harwin]]. He is bent over the biggest book Arya has ever seen. As he hears the report, his face is stern. He then tells her that he had half his guard searching for her, and that she is not supposed to go beyond the gates without his leave. She replies that she was in the dungeons, and they turned into tunnels, she did not have a light, and she could not go back the way she came because of the monsters. She then continues to say that two men were talking about killing him. They said that he had a book and a bastard, and if one Hand could die, why not another. Ned is confused. Arya describes the two men, and that they said that the wolf and lion would eat each other. Everything mixes up in Arya\xe2\x80\x99s head. She tells her father that she thinks one was a wizard. She decides not to mention knocking over the prince, and how she went into a window and found monsters. Ned  confirms that the men were talking about juggling and mummers, and tells her that they must be mummers and that there must be a dozen troupes in [[King\'s Landing]] now. Arya tries to tell him that they were not mummers, but he interrupts her, saying she should not be spying on people. Then he states he does not want his daughter crawling through strange windows going after stray cats and notes all the scratches on her arms. He continues by stating this has gone on long enough and that he wants a word with Syrio. The announcement of an arrival from the [[Night\'s Watch]] interrupts their conversation.\n\n[[Yoren]] is ushered in and Ned greets him pleasantly despite his being stooped, ugly, smelly, and in unwashed clothes. Yoren apologizes for the hour, and states that Ayra has the look of Ned\xe2\x80\x99s son. Arya replies that she is a girl, and then asks about her brothers since she assumes Yoren must have come by way of [[Winterfell]], and if he can deliver a letter to Jon, thinking Jon will believe her story of the men in the dungeon. Yoren explains to Ned that he is there to find men for [[the Wall]], but he has other news, news that should be told in private. Ned tells [[Desmond]] to show Arya to her room. She tries to confirm that nothing bad has happened to [[Jon Snow|Jon]] or [[Benjen Stark|her uncle]], and Yoren tells her that Jon is fine.\n\nAs Desmond takes her to her room, Arya asks him how many guards her father has. He answers 50. Then Arya wants assurance that they will not let anybody kill her father, so Desmond tells her that they guard him day and night. Arya mentions that the Lannisters have many more men, and he answers that a northerner is worth 10 southerners. When she asks about wizards, he says a wizard dies the same as anyone else when you cut his head off.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/07/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-16 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/033/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 32]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Arya Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in King\'s Landing]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 33, Arya]]</text>\n      <sha1>nmvg9923plefi0wlghcs1edtqih6gej</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Clash of Kings-Chapter 64</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5748</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166467</id>\n      <parentid>165639</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-23T21:01:21Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4059">{{Infobox Chapter ACfK\n| pov\t\t= [[Arya Stark]]\n| place         = [[Harrenhal]]\n| title\t\t= Arya X\n| page\t\t= 648\n| previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 63|Daenerys V]]\n| current\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 64|Arya X]] \n| next\t\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 65|Sansa VIII]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 47|Arya IX]]\n| arc next\t= \n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:Valar Morghulis by Tim Tsang.jpg\xe2\x80\x8e|In order to escape [[Harrenhal]], [[Arya Stark]] slit the throat of the guard at postern gate - \xc2\xa9 Tim Tsang|thumb|430px|left]]\nAfter aiding in the capture of [[Harrenhal]] [[Arya Stark|Arya]] is now serving Lord [[Roose Bolton]]. She is bothered by the killing and head-staking of many of the servants who worked for Lord [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]], most of them inherited from Lady [[Shella Whent]] who held Harrenhal prior to Lord Tywin.&lt;ref&gt; Maester [[Tothmure]], [[Lucan]] the armorer, Goodwife [[Harra]], and Lady Shella Whent\'s former steward.&lt;/ref&gt; Arya does not wish to reveal herself to the Lord of the [[Dreadfort]], even though she knows the man to be one of [[Robb Stark|Robb]]\xe2\x80\x99s banner-men. \n\nArya overhears a meeting between Bolton and his advisors, mainly [[House Frey|Freys]]. The Freys believe that Robb will lose, and that they should sue for peace and leave Harrenhal. Bolton states that he is not a man to be undone, like [[Stannis Baratheon]] was. Arya learns that [[Winterfell]] has fallen and is horrified when she finds out that her brothers are dead. Bolton dismisses the Freys, and has Arya remove the leeches. \n\n[[Qyburn]] reads a letter from the Lady [[Walda Frey (daughter of Merrett)|Walda]], Bolton\xe2\x80\x99s new wife. Bolton orders the letter burned, and a message sent to [[Helman Tallhart]], who had recently taken [[Darry]] from the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]]. Bolton orders him and [[Robett Glover]] to burn the castle and put the people within to the sword in the name of King Robb, and then to strike east for [[Duskendale]]. Bolton says that both men will wish vengeance for what has transpired to their families and homes in [[the North]].\n\nBolton then announces that he will hunt wolves that day, for he cannot sleep with all the howling at night. That evening, Bolton returns with nine dead wolves, and tells Arya that he means to give Harrenhal to [[Vargo Hoat]] when he returns to the north. Arya is to remain at Harrenhal to serve the Goat. Outside the tower occupied by the Freys, she hears much shouting within and sees [[Elmar Frey|Elmar]] crying on the steps. The young son of Lord [[Walder Frey]] says, &quot;We\xe2\x80\x99ve been dishonored. There was a bird from the Twins. My lord father says I\xe2\x80\x99ll need to marry someone else.&quot; Elmar was promised a princess originally, but whether or not he knows it to be Arya{{Ref|AGOT|59}} is unknown. \n\nArya then decides to flee [[Harrenhal]], and eventually convinces [[Gendry]] and [[Hot Pie]] to come with her that night. They meet at the [[Tower of Ghosts]], Gendry says the postern gate is guarded, and Arya says she will get rid of the guard. She approaches him openly and tells him that Lord Roose has her giving a silver piece to all the guards for their service. She takes out the coin Jaqen gave her and drops it, when the guard reach for it, she slits his throat and the three ride out through a sally port and away from Harrenhal.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n* The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n* [http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/08/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-30 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n* [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2012/02/re-read-arya-x-love-roose.html Analyses and summary of the chapter] in the course of a 10th reread by Slynt.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 64]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Arya Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Harrenhal]]\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 64]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 65, Arya]]</text>\n      <sha1>6yxpf04cw4ycbip976tquz00ap9eg5d</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>The Forsaken (The Winds of Winter)</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>23160</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>200217</id>\n      <parentid>192004</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2017-07-28T10:21:31Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Casmir</username>\n        <id>6441</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <minor/>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2897">{{Warning|This information has thus far been released in a sample chapter for \'\'[[The Winds of Winter]]\'\', and might therefore not be in finalized form.

R. Martin]] reading at Balticon 50 on May 29, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Aeron Greyjoy|Aeron Damphair]] awakens in a grim dungeon and is forced to drink [[shade of the evening]] by his brother, [[Euron Greyjoy|Euron]]. Aeron dreams of his dead brother [[Urrigon Greyjoy|Urri]], of Euron on a throne of skulls, and of [[religion|gods]] impaled on the [[Iron Throne]].\n\nAeron remembers that after the [[kingsmoot]] he intended to raise the [[smallfolk]] of the [[Iron Islands]], but he was quickly abducted by Euron\'s mutes. After the [[taking of the Shields]], he was held in the dungeon of [[Oakenshield Castle]] and visited by [[Falia Flowers]], the bastard daughter of Lord [[Humfrey Hewett]]. Despite Aeron\'s warning, Falia insisted she will become Euron\'s [[salt wife]] and a sister to [[Daenerys Targaryen]], who is to be Euron\'s [[rock wife]]. While sailing on the \'\'[[Silence]]\'\' to the current dungeon, Euron admits to having caused the deaths of [[Harlon Greyjoy|Harlon]], [[Robin Greyjoy|Robin]], and King [[Balon Greyjoy|Balon]].\n\nAt the second dungeon, Aeron is joined by mutilated priests, including [[septons]], a burned [[red priest]] who quickly dies, and [[warlocks]], one of whom repeats the word &quot;[[Pyat Pree|Pree]]&quot;. In another vision, Aeron sees Euron as a [[kraken]]-like figure on the [[Iron Throne]], accompanied by a shadow in a woman\'s form. Aeron and the other priests are eventually brought from the second dungeon to the stone hall above. It is filled with hanging corpses, men who lived on an isle near the [[Arbor]].\n\nEuron\'s men prepare for the arrivals of the [[Redwyne fleet]] and ships of [[House Hightower]]. On the deck of the \'\'Silence\'\', Aeron sees Euron armored in [[Valyrian steel]] and believes Euron\'s claim at the kingsmoot to have visited [[Valyria]]. Euron orders the priests to be bound to the prows of [[ironborn]] longships, with Aeron on the \'\'Silence\'\'. Once at sea, Aeron is joined by Falia, now pregnant and without tongue. Aeron tastes salt on his lips.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|The Winds of Winter: Forsaken]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Aeron Greyjoy]]\n\n[[es:Vientos de Invierno-El Abandonado]]</text>\n      <sha1>2tckxwi3a1uhku1sy8x9fb5h5lgj7pz</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Game of Thrones-Chapter 50</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6034</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>198689</id>\n      <parentid>165993</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2017-04-11T19:45:40Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Nittanian</username>\n        <id>3504</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7761">{{Infobox Chapter AGoT\n| pov\t\t= [[Arya Stark]]\n| place         = [[King\'s Landing]]\n| title\t\t= Arya IV\n| page\t\t= 443\n| previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 49|Eddard XIV]]\n| current\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 50|Arya IV]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 51|Sansa IV]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 32|Arya III]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 65|Arya V]]\n}} __NOTOC__\n\n[[Arya Stark|Arya]]\xe2\x80\x99s training with [[Syrio Forel]] is interrupted by Ser [[Meryn Trant]] and a party of [[House Lannister guards|Lannister guardsmen]]. When Meryn demands Arya come with him, Syrio senses something odd and fights the guards, giving Arya time to escape. At the stables Arya finds her sword [[Needle]] and kills a stable boy who attempts to capture her before escaping via the dungeons of the [[Red Keep]].\n\n==Synopsis==    \n[[Arya Stark|Arya]] is training with [[Syrio Forel]] in the Small Hall before they are due to board ship for [[Winterfell]]. Syrio calls his strikes and Arya blocks each in turn until one hits her breast from the wrong side and Syrio says she is dead. Arya complains that Syrio cheated by lying. The swordsman says only his words lied, not his eyes or his arm, but she was not seeing. Arya insists that she watched him every second, but Syrio declares that watching is not seeing. To illustrate his point, Syrio tells her how he became the [[First Sword of Braavos]]. \n\nSyrio explains that there were many who were stronger, faster, or younger, but he was the best because he could see the truth. After the death of the previous First Sword, many [[bravos]] were called to the [[Sealord of Braavos|Sealord]] and as many were sent away. Finally, Syrio was called before the Sealord, who had a fat yellow cat on his lap. The Sealord said the animal had been brought to him from a faraway land by one of his captains and asked if Syrio had ever seen her like. Syrio replied that he had seen a thousand like him in the alleys of Braavos, and that same day Syrio was named the First Sword. Arya says she does not understand. Syrio explains that the cat was just an ordinary one, but the other men all expected a marvelous beast, so that was what they saw. In addition, the Sealord had called it \xe2\x80\x9cher\xe2\x80\x9d and that was what the others saw, even though it was clearly a tomcat. Arya understands then, and Syrio tells her to uses her senses first and her mind second. Then he declares that when they get to Winterfell it will be time to put \xe2\x80\x9c[[Needle]]\xe2\x80\x9d in her hand.\n\nThe great wooden doors fly open to reveal five [[House Lannister guards|Lannister guardsmen]] and Ser [[Meryn Trant]] of the [[Kingsguard]]. Meryn orders Arya to come with him to see her father. Arya is about to follow when Syrio stops her and asks why Lord [[Eddard Stark|Eddard]] would send Lannister men instead of his own. Arya immediately realizes the truth of Syrio\xe2\x80\x99s statement and picks up her stick sword. When Meryn insists he is trustworthy as a member of the Kingsguard, Arya replies that so is [[Jaime Lannister|the Kingslayer]].\n\nDispensing with the charade, Meryn orders Arya seized. When a guard approaches Arya, Syrio stands before her. The guard orders Syrio out of the way, calling him an old man. Syrio declares his name and that they will be speaking to him with more respect. Unimpressed, the guard goes for his sword but Syrio is faster and breaks the man\xe2\x80\x99s fingers with his wooden sword. Then Meryn orders the Lannister guards to attack and Syrio instructs Arya to go to her father. As the guards attack Syrio, Arya can see that Syrio was only toying with her during their practices; by the time Arya reaches the far end of the hall, Syrio is surrounded by five dead or dying men. Then Meryn, in his heavy plate armor, draws his sword. Syrio tells Arya to go, but she watches as the First Sword lands many blows on the knight\'s armor before Meryn breaks Syrio\xe2\x80\x99s wooden sword. Arya turns and runs through the kitchen, crying. \n\nAs she runs, Arya thinks of everything Syrio has told her: \xe2\x80\x9cSwift as a deer. Quiet as a shadow. Quick as a snake. Calm as still water. Fear cuts deeper than swords. Strong as a bear. Fierce as a wolverine. Fear cuts deeper than swords. The man who fears losing has already lost. Fear cuts deeper than swords\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nHer sword grip is slick with sweat when she reaches the turret stair. She wonders if she should go up or down. She then remembers Syrio telling her to do the unexpected, so she goes down to a cavernous cellar that she knows is a dead end. She climbs up to a window. Outside the window she can see the stout door to the [[Tower of the Hand]] is splintered, one of her father\xe2\x80\x99s guards lies dead on the stairs, and she can hear fighting. She thinks about when she heard a man say that if one [[Hand of the King|Hand]] can die, so can another. As she moves, Arya pretends that she is catching cats but then realizes that she is the cat and is dead if they catch her. \n\nOutside the stable she finds [[Hullen]] lying on the ground, looking dead. When she approaches him, he opens his eyes and tells her to warn her father before dying. Inside, Arya finds more dead men including [[Desmond]], who said he would protect her father. There is only a single Lannister body, and Arya remembers Desmond\'s claim that every [[Northmen|northman]] was worth ten [[southron]]s. Losing her temper, Arya kicks Desmond\'s body and calls him a liar.\n\nAs Arya collects horse tack, she finds her broken chest on the ground. She gropes around for [[Needle]]. Just as her fingers touch the sword a stable boy appears behind her with a pitchfork. She asks him to help her saddle a horse, saying her father will reward him. The boy responds that her father is dead and that [[Cersei Lannister|the queen]] will reward him. When he grabs her arm, Arya forgets all of Syrio\xe2\x80\x99s lessons, only remembering the lesson that [[Jon Snow]] taught her. She sticks the pointy end through the boy\xe2\x80\x99s belly, killing him.\n\nAs she saddles her mare, Arya realizes that the gates will be closed and the guards will let no one out; she has to go another way. Immediately she wonders if she can find the room with the monsters again. However, to do that she must cross the open yard and the walls are crowded with more [[City Watch of King\'s Landing|gold cloaks]] and soldiers than she has ever seen. Reciting Syrio\xe2\x80\x99s words to herself, she walks slowly across the yard to the empty royal sept, hiding Needle under the cloak she has put on; it is the scariest thing she has ever done. Taking two of the candles in the sept, she crawls out a back window.\n\nIt takes Arya more than an hour to find the room: crawling through windows, over walls, and through cellars. She goes back to light her candle and returns. Now the monsters do not frighten her. Neither do the rats in the dungeons. The [[crypts of Winterfell]] were scarier, and she and her siblings were once taken there by [[Robb Stark|Robb]] to visit their own waiting tombs. Then Jon had suddenly appeared covered in flour, pretending to be a ghost, but that had not scared her. The memory of her safe home at Winterfell makes Arya smile as she plunges deeper into the darkness of the tunnel.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/09/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-25 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/051/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==    \n[[Category:A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 50]]\n[[Category:A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Arya Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 51, Arya]]\n[[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\x90\xd1\x80\xd1\x8c\xd1\x8f IV]]</text>\n      <sha1>o0ai30of71yzno5c583jffqttfpzmke</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 56</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5706</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>175009</id>\n      <parentid>171849</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-10-18T03:46:08Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Mindset</username>\n        <id>4579</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3607">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Bran Stark|Bran]]\n| title\t\t= Bran IV\n| place         = the [[Nightfort]]\n| page\t\t= 624\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 55|Jon VII]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 56|Bran IV]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 57|Daenerys V]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 40|Bran III]]\n| arc next\t=\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\nReaching the [[Nightfort]], [[Bran Stark|Bran]] recalls all the horror tales he\xe2\x80\x99s heard about this castle, such as the stories of the [[Rat Cook]], [[Mad Axe]], and the [[Night\'s King]]. Before it was abandoned by the [[Night\'s Watch|Watch]] some two hundred years before, the Nightfort had once been the greatest castle along the Wall. However, [[Meera Reed|Meera]] and [[Jojen Reed]] are unafraid of the ancient castle. They sleep that night in the kitchens, near a seemingly bottomless well. Deep in the night, Bran is woken by footsteps coming from the well. He awakens Meera, and then takes control of [[Hodor]]\xe2\x80\x99s body as he does when he enters [[Summer (direwolf)|Summer]].\n\nBut it is only [[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] and [[Gilly]] who emerge from the well, carrying Gilly\xe2\x80\x99s infant son. Gilly asks them if they are the ones [[Coldhands]] was sent to find, but Bran has no idea what she is speaking of. Meera asks them how they got past [[the Wall]], and Sam reveals that Coldhands had led them to the [[Nightfort#Black Gate|Black Gate]], which only a brother of the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch can open. Sam describes Coldhands as dressed all in black like a sworn brother, but his skin and the cold from his body reminded Sam of a [[wights|wight]]. But Coldhands could speak, his eyes did not burn blue, and he and his ravens had saved them from the wights. When the Reeds inquire why Coldhands wasn\xe2\x80\x99t with them, Sam tells them that the Wall was more than just ice and stone, there were ancient spells woven into it, and the Wall would not let Coldhands pass. Jojen tells Sam that Bran is the one Coldhands seeks. Tarly realizes who Bran is, but promises not to tell anyone of Bran\xe2\x80\x99s whereabouts on his honor and his friendship with [[Jon Snow|Jon]]. \n\nJojen has Sam bring them to the Black Gate, which is an ancient white [[weirwood]] growing beneath the Wall and the Nightfort.

[[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] convinces Jon that being the [[Lord Commander of the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch|Lord Commander\xe2\x80\x99s]] steward is actually an honor meant to groom him for command. Jon and Sam are taken to a [[godswood]] [[beyond the Wall]] to say their vows before the [[old gods]]. After they have taken their vows, [[Ghost]] returns with a human hand in his jaws.\n\n==Synopsis==    \n[[Jon Snow|Jon]] is eating breakfast when [[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] excitedly tells that he has been passed out of training with Jon and the rest. Jon feigns surprise and Sam explains that he will be working for [[Maester]] [[Aemon]], who needs somebody who can read and write to work in the library and with the birds. Sam is concerned about getting to the [[Faith of the Seven#sept|sept]] in time, otherwise the officers may change their minds. When they arrive at the sept the other recruits are genuinely shocked to see Sam, but no one dares to say a word.\n\nAll the officers arrive together. [[Lord Commander of the Night\'s Watch|Lord Commander]] [[Jeor Mormont]] makes his customary speech about taking vows and being a member of the [[Night\'s Watch]]. Mormont asks if any wish to leave before taking their vows, but no one does. Then Mormont asks if any of them follow the [[old gods]] and Jon speaks up. The recruits whisper that there is no [[godswood]] at [[the Wall]]. Mormont confirms that [[Castle Black]] has no need of a godswood since the [[haunted forest]] beyond the Wall stands as it did in the [[Dawn Age]] and there is a [[weirwood]] grove half a league from the castle. It is then that Sam speaks up that he also wants to swear his vows before the [[heart tree]], despite being born into the [[Faith of the Seven]]. When Ser [[Jaremy Rykker]] questions why Sam would forsake the gods of his [[House Tarly|House]], Sam declares that the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch is his House now and the Seven have never answered his prayers.\n\nAt the end of the ceremony, the Lord Commander announces the assignments: [[Halder]] and [[Albett]] to the builders; [[Grenn]], [[Pypar]], [[Todder]], and [[Matthar]] to the rangers; Samwell, [[Dareon]], and Jon to the stewards. Jon is flabbergasted and believes there must be a mistake, but when he sees Ser [[Alliser Thorne]]\xe2\x80\x99s black eyes studying him he knows it is an intentional snub. The Lord Commander pronounces his last words and leaves. The Firsts call the recruits from each of the groups.\n\nAfter the rest are gone, Lord Steward [[Bowen Marsh]] states that Sam will work in the library and rookery with Maester Aemon, since [[Chett]] has been reassigned to the kennels. Dareon will be sent to [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea|Eastwatch]] to work with the merchants. Jon will be personal steward to the Lord Commander at Mormont\'s own request. Jon sarcastically suggests a number of menial duties for himself and is told \xe2\x80\x9ccertainly\xe2\x80\x9d and given several more duties. When Jon asks if they take him for a servant, Maester Aemon answers that they took him for a man of the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch, though perhaps they were wrong.\n\n[[File:The old gods by thrumugnyr.jpg|thumb|260px|right|Jon Snow swears his vows - by Thrumugnyr\xc2\xa9]]\n\nOutside in the yard, Jon rants about the unfairness of his appointment, since he is a better swordsman and rider. Dareon is angered by Jon\xe2\x80\x99s tantrum, since he himself was unfairly sent to the Wall for a false accusation. Sam quiets Jon by telling him the Lord Commander probably intends to groom him for command. Sam explains that [[Randyll Tarly|his father]] once insisted that he be at his side for all important events but once he fell out of favor his father no longer cared. Suddenly Jon is ashamed; Sam has accepted his situation like a man, while he has been playing the boy. Jon admits that Sam is right and agrees to take his vows.\n\nLate that afternoon, they proceed through the cold tunnel under the Wall and through three gates that Bowen Marsh must unlock. When they are finally outside again, Sam worries about the [[free folk|wildlings]] but is told they have never come this close to the Wall. Never-the-less, they are joined by an escort of rangers. Jon whistles and [[Ghost]] lopes out of the tunnel and then into the woods. The haunted forest is much like the [[Wolfswood]] around [[Winterfell]], but its feel is much more ominous. It is dusk when they finally arrive at a clearing with nine weirwoods, a number unheard of south of the Wall. Sam looks at the faces on each of the trees and says that he can feel the old gods watching.\n\nAs night falls, Jon and Sam kneel and say their vows together:\n\n{{Quote| Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night\'s Watch, for this night and all nights to come.}}\n\nWhen they are finished, Bowen Marsh declares that they knelt as boys and now rise as men of the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch. The gnarled forester [[Dywen]] says they should be getting back because there is something in the night he dislikes. Then Ghost returns, his red eyes and white face eerily like the faces carved in the weirwoods. In his jaws is a human hand. \n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/09/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-24 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/049/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 48]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Jon Snow]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Castle Black]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in the Haunted Forest]]\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 48]]\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 49, Jon]]\n[[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\x94\xd0\xb6\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbd VI]]</text>\n      <sha1>ikdpdppecmwbkbjoqcxhg3i0t1p8gav</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 52</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5809</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166901</id>\n      <parentid>122041</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-06-04T15:44:23Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Frernok</username>\n        <id>5007</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <comment>/*References and Notes*/</comment>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2308">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Arya Stark|Arya]]\n| title\t\t= Arya XI\n| place         = [[the Twins]]\n| page\t\t= 584\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 51|Catelyn VII]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 52|Arya XI]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 53|Tyrion VI]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 50|Arya X]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 65|Arya XII]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Arya Stark|Arya]] and [[Sandor Clegane|Sandor]] try to reach the [[the Twins|castle]].

The riders from the castle attack the northmen, collapsing the pavilions and setting them on fire. Arya and The Hound are spotted by the [[House Frey|Frey men]] and have to defend themselves. Arya wants to go the castle where her [[Catelyn Tully|mother]] and her [[Robb Stark|brother]] are but the Hound tells her they are already [[Red Wedding|dead]].

The next day in court he sends [[Cleos Frey]] back to [[Robb Stark]] with the [[House Lannister|Lannister|]] demands for peace. Finally he hears from [[Alliser Thorne]] about the dead coming alive, and dismisses the threat. Later, he takes [[Grand Maester]] Pycelle into custody, getting him to confess his role in the death of [[Jon Arryn]], among other crimes. \n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] passes Ser [[Meryn Trant]] as he enters [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]]\xe2\x80\x99s chambers, where he finds the recently knighted Ser [[Lancel Lannister]] singing to his sister. He complements both, which unnerves Lancel. Tyrion asks Cersei to dismiss Lancel, as there is an important matter for them to discuss. She immediately thinks it is about the begging brothers that were incarcerated after claiming the gods are punishing everyone for [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] killing the rightful king. Cersei complains that Ser [[Jacelyn Bywater]] did nothing so she commanded [[Vylarr]] to attend to the matter; Tyrion is irritated that Vylarr dragged half a dozen scabrous prophets to the dungeon without consulting him but will not fight over it. After he asks if the bed she sits on is the one where [[Robert I Baratheon|Robert]] died, which she confirms, saying it gives her sweet dreams, he tells her that [[Stannis Baratheon]] has sailed from [[Dragonstone]], and not to [[King\'s Landing]], but to [[Storm\'s End]] to [[siege of Storm\'s End (299)|lay siege]], and [[Renly Baratheon]] is riding to meet him. Tyrion, however, thinks it will end in battle rather than an agreement, since the brothers are too different, yet alike. They laugh heartily and Cersei is so happy she even hugs him. He fills two cups with wine, adding some powder to hers. As they toast, Tyrion wonders if this is the Cersei Jaime sees, and is almost sorry for poisoning her.\n\nThe next morning, Cersei is ill, so Tyrion holds audience alone. In the hall, there are both [[House Lannister|Lannister]] guardsmen and [[City Watch of King\'s Landing|Gold Cloaks]] standing across from each other, with [[Bronn]] and Ser [[Preston Greenfield]] flanking the throne. In attendance are lovely [[Sansa Stark]], the coughing Lord [[Gyles Rosby]], his cousin [[Tyrek Lannister]] who recently married young [[Ermesande Hayford]] (he is teased with the nick name \xe2\x80\x9cwet nurse\xe2\x80\x9d). Ser [[Cleos Frey]] approaches, and Grand Maester [[Pycelle]] announces that they cannot accept Robb\'s terms. Tyrion then gives Ser Cleos their own terms:\n{{Quote|[[Robb Stark]] must lay down his sword, swear fealty, and return to [[Winterfell]]. He must free my brother unharmed, and place his host under Jaime\xe2\x80\x99s command, to march against the rebels Renly and Stannis Baratheon. Each of Stark\xe2\x80\x99s bannermen must send us a son as hostage. A daughter will suffice where there is no son. They shall be treated gently and given high places here at court, so long as their fathers commit no new treasons.}}\nWhen Ser Cleos states that Robb will not agree to these terms, Tyrion continues with: \n{{Quote|Tell him that we have raised another great host at Casterly Rock, that soon it will march on him from the west while my lord father advances from the east. Tell him that he stands alone, without hope of allies. Stannis and Renly Baratheon war against each other, and the [[Prince of Dorne]] has consented to wed his son [[Trystane Martell|Trystane]] to the Princess [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]].\n\nAs to this of my cousins, we offer [[Harrion Karstark]] and Ser [[Wylis Manderly]] for [[Willem Lannister]], and [[Medger Cerwyn|Lord Cerwyn]] and Ser [[Donnel Locke]] for your brother [[Tion Frey|Tion]]. Tell Stark that two Lannisters are worth four northmen in any season. His father\xe2\x80\x99s bones he shall have, as a gesture of Joffrey\xe2\x80\x99s good faith.}}\n\nThis raises murmurs of delight and laughter from the audience. Ser Cleos asks about the sword [[Ice]] and Robb\'s sisters. Tyrion states that he will have the sword when he makes peace and the sisters when Jaime is released. Tyrion then tells Vylarr that Ser Cleos is to also have a Lannister escort since he is a cousin, and that Vylarr is to take all of his guardsmen. This raises concern from Pycelle; Vylarr stands stone still. Tyrion states that the Gold Cloaks and [[Kingsguard]] are adequate to protect [[Joffrey Baratheon|the king]] and queen. [[Varys]] smiles knowingly, [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] feigns boredom, and Pycelle is looking confused. \n\nTyrion attempts to close the meeting, but Ser [[Alliser Thorne]] speaks up complaining about being ignored. Tyrion feigns ignorance of him being in the city, blaming Bronn for making his friend that he walked [[The Wall]] with wait. Ser Alliser wants to speak to the king, but is told he is playing with his new crossbow (which Tyrion has just given him), so Ser Alliser will have to talk with the King\xe2\x80\x99s servants.\n\nSer Alliser relates how they found the corpses of two long dead rangers, and brought them back to the Wall. They rose that night and killed Ser [[Jaremy Rykker]] and attempted to murder Ser [[Jeor Mormont]]. Tyrion gets assurances that the Lord Commander survived and they killed these two dead men. Ser Alliser tells them that they were dead the first time, pale and cold with black hands and feet. As proof he had a hand, but it rotted away while he waited. Tyrion thinks of the dread he felt when he was on the Wall with [[Jon Snow]]. He orders Littlefinger to send Ser Alliser back with 100 spades to bury the dead and prevent them from walking, and also tells Ser Jacelyn that Ser Alliser will have the pick of the dungeons to use the spades. Tyrion is informed that the dungeons are near empty since [[Yoren]] has already taken all the likely men. He tells Ser Jacelyn to arrest some more, or to spread the word that there is food at the wall. Ser Alliser is not easily dismissed, trying to warn Tyron of the danger. Ser Preston intervenes, and Ser Alliser knows better than to challenge a Kingsguard. Then, Bronn marches Ser Alliser from the hall. \n\nVarys compliments Tyrion on how he handled the situation. Littlefinger asks if he meant to send away all his guards, to which Tyrion responds only his sister\xe2\x80\x99s guards. Tryion notes that Littlefinger is not happy with him, and Littlefinger replies that he loves him as much as ever but that Myrcella Baratheon cannot wed [[Robert Arryn]] if she weds Trystane Martell, and to leave him out of the next deception. Glancing at the knife at Littlefinger\xe2\x80\x99s hip, Tyrion apologizes, stating the realm needs him.\n\nTyrion asks Varys to walk with him. Varys tells him that Cersei will never let him send away her guard, and Tyrion replies that Varys is going to help him accomplish this by saying it is part of the plan to free Jaime. Varys is to put the thief, the poisoner, the mummer, and the murderer in crimson cloaks to join the rest of the guard escorting Ser Cleos\xe2\x80\x94four among 400 Lannister men cannot be watched closely. She will not like it and be uneasy, but Tyrion likes her uneasy.\n\nSer Cleos leaves that afternoon, escorted by 100 Lannister guardsmen. That same afternoon, Tyrion finds [[Timett]] dicing in the barracks and tells him to meet him in his solar at midnight. He feasts with the [[Vale mountain clans]] that night, shunning wine for once. During the feast he asks [[Shagga]] what moon it is and is told black, which they call the traitor\xe2\x80\x99s moon. He tells Shagga to not get too drunk and to keep his axe sharp.\n\nShagga uses his axe to destroy the door to Pycelle\xe2\x80\x99s chambers. Tyrion has Timett pull the naked serving girl out of the bed and march/drag her into the hall. Tyrion pulls the blanket off the maester, who asks why this is being done to a loyal servant. Tyrion tells him that he sent one of his letters to [[Doran Martell]] and the other to Cersei. Pycelle tries to blame Varys, but Tyrion informs him that he was the only one he entrusted the information with. Pycelle tries to claim that something happened to the letter on the way, and that he knows things about Varys that would chill Tyrion\'s blood. Tyrion replies that his lady prefers his blood hot. Then, Pycelle tries to accuse Littlefinger, to which Tyrion responds that he already knows about him. Tyrion instructs Shagga to cut off Pycelle\'s manhood and feed it to the goats. When Shagga states there are no goats, Tyrion tells him to make do. Shagga first takes most of Pycelle\xe2\x80\x99s beard with his axe as Pycelle sprays everything with urine. Pycelle tells Tyrion that he did everything for House Lannister and to ask [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]; he says he was even responsible for convincing [[Aerys II Targaryen]] to open the gates. Tyrion, shocked, states \xe2\x80\x9cSo the Sack of King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing was your work as well?\xe2\x80\x9d He then asks him how many he has betrayed: Aerys, [[Eddard Stark]], himself, King [[Robert I Baratheon|Robert]], [[Jon Arryn]], Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]]? Pycelle pleads that Robert was a wretched king, that [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]] was plotting to bring [[Mace Tyrell]]\xe2\x80\x99s [[Margaery Tyrell|daughter]] to court and have Cersei supplanted as Queen. Tyrion asks what Lord Arryn had been plotting, and Pycelle explains that Jon Arryn knew of Cersei\xe2\x80\x99s incest. Pycelle also knew that Lord Jon planned to send [[Lysa Arryn|his wife]] back to the Eyrie, [[Robert Arryn|his son]] to foster on [[Dragonstone]], and that he meant to act on his knowledge. Thanks to Shagga\xe2\x80\x99s axe making closer and closer shaves of Pycelle\'s neck, Tyrion finally gets him to confess that he had a hand in the death of [[Jon Arryn]] by assuring he wouldn\'t receive effective treatment because he knew about the father of Cersei\xe2\x80\x99s children. He tells them he knew that Cersei wanted Jon dead but could not say it since Varys was always listening. He sent [[Colemon]] away because he was purging Jon. Then Pycelle attempts to blame [[Hugh]] for the poisoning, telling Tyrion that Varys can tell him. Disgusted, Tyrion orders Pycelle thrown into one of the black cells.\n\nWhen Pycelle is gone, Tyrion searches the quarters and collects a few more small jars, thinking how he wished Pycelle was the one he could have trusted; Varys and Littlefinger are no more loyal, just more subtle and thus more dangerous. Tyrion suspects his father\'s method might be best; send for [[Ilyn Payne]], have all three of their heads mounted above the gates and be done with it.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n*Analyses and summary of the chapter [http://slynt.blogspot.se/2011/10/re-read-tyrion-vi-man-baby.html in the course of a 10th reread] by Slynt. \n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/03/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-12 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 25]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Tyrion Lannister]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 25]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 26, Tyrion]]</text>\n      <sha1>gqshn1pz4cy6jf22927fyvu5kc80z0f</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Game of Thrones-Chapter 23</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>3867</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>165966</id>\n      <parentid>122909</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-17T14:13:22Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7016">{{Infobox Chapter AGoT\n| pov\t\t= [[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n| place         = The [[Dothraki Sea]]\n| title\t\t= Daenerys III\n| page\t\t= \n| previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 22|Arya II]]\n| current\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 23|Daenerys III]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 24|Bran IV]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 11|Daenerys II]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 36|Daenerys IV]]\n}} __NOTOC__\n\n[[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] learns to embrace her life in [[Drogo]]\'s \'\'[[khalasar]]\'\', and stands up to [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]] for the first time. Afterward, when Drogo arrives to have sex with her, she rides him instead of being taken from behind and becomes pregnant.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:Flatlands Dothraki.jpg|thumb|350px|left|The Dothraki Sea {TV Series)]]\n\n[[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] looks out for the first time onto the vast, empty, flat plain of the [[Dothraki Sea]] with Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] beside her. Daenerys sees she has out-distanced the rest of [[Drogo]]\xe2\x80\x99s \'\'[[khalasar]]\'\', who are still climbing the ridge behind her. Among them she can see her brother [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]] struggling with his riding. The sight brings back the memory of [[Illyrio Mopatis]] offering to let Viserys stay in [[Pentos]] as his guest. Viserys had refused and insisted on coming with the \'\'khalasar\'\' to ensure that Drogo would give him the army that he promised. Daenerys commands Jorah and the others to wait. Mormont comments that Daenerys is starting to sound like a queen but Daenerys corrects him, calling herself a \'\'[[khaleesi]]\'\'.\n\nAs she rides out alone, Daenerys reflects on how the days of the journey have hardened her body. She no longer has open saddle sores nor does she suffer unbearable pain after a day\xe2\x80\x99s ride. At first, Drogo would ignore Daenerys to spend his days talking, drinking, and racing with his [[bloodrider]]s, leaving her to eat meals alone or with Viserys and Jorah Mormont. Yet every night Drogo would come and ride her from behind. She had been miserable until she had dreamt of a dragon that engulfed her in flame and cleansed her. After that, each day had been easier than the one before it and she had found pleasure in the new sights of the journey, even starting to enjoy sex with Drogo.\n\n[[File:Jorah Mormont.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Ser Jorah Mormont - \xc2\xa9 Amok]]\n\nOnce she is totally alone, Daenerys decides to dismount and take off her boots so she can feel the earth. Suddenly, Viserys is there, screaming and grabbing her. He is furious that she commanded him to stay on the ridge with the others. For the first time in her life, Daenerys shoves him back. For a moment Viserys is shocked, but then the rage returns and Daenerys sees that he intends to hurt her badly. Before he can, [[Jhogo]]\xe2\x80\x99s whip catches Viserys around the neck and pulls him to the ground.\n\nHer handmaiden [[Irri]] translates for them as Jhogo asks if Daenerys would like to see Viserys dead or disfigured as punishment for his attack. Daenerys declines, but tells them to take Viserys\xe2\x80\x99 horse and make him walk, an emasculating punishment among the horselords. Viserys, now recovered enough to shout, orders Ser Jorah to kill the Dothraki and discipline Daenerys, but the exiled knight makes the decision to turn to Daenerys and agree that Viserys should walk.\n\nDaenerys is amazed that she hit Viserys and asks Jorah if she has woken the dragon in Viserys. Jorah replies her brother Rhaegar was the last Dragon, while Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake. Daenerys insists that Viserys is still the rightful king, but when Jorah asks if she would want her brother as the king, she realizes that Viserys\xe2\x80\x99 would not be a good king. Even so, Daenerys remains convinced that the people of [[Westeros]] are praying for Viserys return until Jorah explains that peasants only pray for rain, health, and a summer that never ends. Daenerys declares that Viserys will never be able to retake the [[Seven Kingdoms]], realizing that she has known this for a long time. Viserys could not lead an army even if her husband gave him one.\n\nDaenerys races her silver ahead of Jorah and the others. It is dusk by the time she returns to the \'\'khalasar\'\'. Daenerys imagines the laughter in the \'\'khalasar\'\' when news spreads about Viserys; by the time her brother can return, everyone in the camp will know him as a walker. \n\nAs she enters her tent, Daenerys sees a finger of light touch her dragon eggs and, for a moment, she sees scarlet flames before her eyes. When she touches the eggs they feel hot, which she attributes to the sunshine during the day. Daenerys remembers all of the stories about other magical creatures and wonders why there should not also be dragons. Her Dothraki handmaidens, [[Irri]] and [[Jhiqui]], tell her that dragons were all killed by men. However, her [[Lys|Lysene]] handmaiden [[Doreah]], a former sex slave, tells Daenerys a story about a time when there were two moons in the sky, but one came too close to the sun and cracked to release the first dragons. The story ends by claiming that one day the other moon will crack and the dragons will return. The other handmaidens make fun of the story, insisting that the moon is a goddess, not an egg.\n\nDaenerys sends Irri and Jhiqui away but orders Doreah to stay with her for dinner. When Drogo returns, she takes him outside because Dothraki customs say that everything of importance must be done under the open sky. When Drogo tries to take her from behind, Daenerys tells him that she wants to see his face and climbs on top of him. She rides Drogo as fiercely as she has ever ridden her horse and in the moment of his pleasure Drogo calls out her name.\n\nOn the far side of the Dothraki Sea, on her 14th name day, Daenerys\xe2\x80\x99 handmaiden Jhiqui brushes her stomach and tells her that she is pregnant.\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n*[[Jorah Mormont]]\n*[[Irri]]\n*[[Viserys Targaryen]]\n*[[Quaro]]\n*[[Aggo]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Drogo]]\n*[[Jhiqui]]\n*[[Jhogo]]\n*[[Doreah]]\n*[[Rakharo]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Aegon I Targaryen]]\n*[[Illyrio Mopatis]]\n*[[Rhaegar Targaryen]]\n*[[Aegon III Targaryen]]\n|}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2009/05/arya-daenerys.html Humorous review of the chapter]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/06/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-12 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/024/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 23]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Daenerys Targaryen|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 23]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in the Dothraki Sea]]\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 23]]\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 24, Daenerys]]\n[[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\x94\xd1\x8d\xd0\xb9\xd0\xbd\xd0\xb5\xd1\x80\xd0\xb8\xd1\x81 III]]</text>\n      <sha1>cwk7pl8mdw2meakj6p1wyt5tcw3sinq</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 44</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6874</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166586</id>\n      <parentid>98755</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-25T21:48:00Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7915">{{Infobox Chapter ADwD\n| pov\t\t= [[Jon Snow]]\n| place         = [[Castle Black]]\n| title\t\t= Jon IX\n| page\t\t= 579\n| previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 43|Daenerys VII]]\n| current\t= Jon IX\n| next\t\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 45|The Blind Girl]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 39|Jon VIII]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 49|Jon X]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Selyse Florent|Queen Selyse]] arrives at Castle Black with [[Shireen Baratheon|Shireen]], [[Patchface]], [[Axell Florent]], and others, all on their way to the [[Nightfort]]. They are accompanied by [[Tycho Nestoris]], an emissary of the [[Iron Bank of Braavos]]. [[Jon Snow|Jon]] warns Selyse that the Nightfort is still mostly in ruins and advises her that they may be most comfortable at [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]]. \n\nThe queen says that they are not safe there and insists on going to the Nightfort. Then, [[Wun Wun]] appears, startling the ladies. The giant speaks a few kind words, but mangles them. Jon tells the women he is only just learning the [[Common Tongue]] as all giants speak the [[Old Tongue]]. Wun Wun\'s laugh startles and frightens the group, causing [[Patrek of King\'s Mountain|Ser Patrek]] to draw his sword. Jon warns him to never draw his sword against a giant as he is protected by guest rights here, which Jon says they still honor in the north, though the south may not.\n\nJon then offers to give Tycho a tour atop the Wall, but he prefers to speak with Jon now, preferably in a warm room. Tycho tells Jon that the [[Iron Throne]] has ceased all debt payments to the Iron Bank.&lt;ref&gt;It happened in [[A Feast for Crows]], [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 17|Chapter 17]], Cersei; another emissary from the Iron Bank appealed unsuccessfully for repayment [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 24|Chapter 24]], which is therefore likely to fit chronologically before this one&lt;/ref&gt; Jon thinks this must be madness on the part of the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]]. He thinks that the Iron Bank may want to support [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] in his war to ensure that the debt is eventually payed. Jon asks for a favour: to borrow ships and a loan to keep the [[Night\'s Watch]] fed until spring. Tycho says this is impossible, but after a few hours of drinking and haggling they strike a deal.\n\nWith the three ships added to the Eastwatch fleet, Jon counts that they now have eleven ships. He hopes to bring the [[wildlings]] down from [[Hardhome]] around the Wall in order to save them and not have them become more [[wight]]s in thrall to [[The Others]]. However, he is unsure if [[Mother Mole]] will be desperate enough to trust her people to the men of the [[Night\'s Watch]].\n\nHe discusses things further with Tycho; he asks after [[Maester Aemon]], [[Gilly]] and [[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] but Tycho knows nothing and Jon can merely hope they have reached [[Oldtown]]. They talk about an unknown fleet prowling the narrow sea and rumours of [[dragon]]s coming from the east, Jon joking that a dragon would warm things up. Tycho says sternly that [[Braavosi|his people]] are descended from those who fled the dragonlords of [[Valyria]] and they do not joke lightly about such, so Jon apologizes. \n\nThey make their way to the common hall, where Axell Florent asks Jon to see [[Val]]. Jon surmises that he must know the woman is gone. He then excuses himself and leaves, pondering the dangers of the agreement with Tycho, uncertain if the Watch will ever be able to repay the Iron Bank and thus avoid consequences. But Jon knows that between being bankrupt and dead, he made the right choice. He also takes another moment to marvel on the stupidity of the Lannisters; the Iron Bank is notorious for deposing royalty who don\'t repay their debts and he notes that if Stannis makes a deal with the Braavosi, he will acquire enough money to hire numerous [[sellsword]] companies, to bribe as many lords as he needs and keep his men fed, armed and supplied. Jon muses that unless \'\'&quot;Stannis is lying dead beneath the walls of [[Winterfell]], he may just have won the Iron Throne&quot;\'\'. \n\nHe goes to sleep but is awoken by [[Mully]], who tells him that a girl has arrived on a dying horse. Jon\'s thoughts instantly go to [[Melisandre]]\'s vision and he giddily thinks that [[Arya Stark|Arya]] may have come to him as prophesied. He also thinks about plans to keep Arya safe; she cannot stay at the Wall, for Stannis will just marry her off to one of his vassals so as to gain a claim to Winterfell, and Jon doesn\'t know but fears what Melisandre may want with her-Jon speculates that he might be able to convince Tycho to make arrangements to have Arya fostered with some noble family in [[Braavos]] or the [[Free Cities]]. When he meets her however, to his disappointment Jon sees that the girl in question is not Arya; she is too old. He recognises her as [[Alys Karstark]], having met her before when they were both children, when [[Rickard Karstark|her father]] brought her to Winterfell in hope of negotiating a marriage between her and [[Robb Stark|Robb]]. She warns him not to let [[Cregan Karstark]] take her back with him when he arrives, as he and his father [[Arnolf Karstark]] intend to force her into marrying Cregan. She also learns the truth about her father\'s execution from Jon and is unsurprised to learn that Robb killed him for murdering prisoners in a fit of rage; her father was a brooding man, and her uncles are no better. \n\nAlys asks Jon if there is still a blood-feud between them after the death of her father, but he assures her that men of the Night\'s Watch hold no grudges. She tells him that after [[Jaime Lannister]] killed her two elder brothers and [[Daryn Hornwood|her betrothed]] at the [[Battle of the Whispering Wood]], she and her brother [[Harrion Karstark|Harry]] are the rightful heirs to their titles. However, Harrion has been a captive for more than a year; Arnolf only declared Karhold for Stannis in the hope it would provoke the Lannisters to execute Harrion. If that happened, Alys would be heir to Karhold, at which point Cregan would marry her, get a child from her and then get rid of her. Jon offers to write to Stannis about the matter on her behalf but Alys reveals that the Karstarks are playing Stannis false; they have long been in league with [[Roose Bolton]] and are only waiting for his word to betray Stannis. Alys entreats Jon to protect her, pleading that he is the only hope she has left.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n* [[Jon Snow]]\n* [[Selyse Florent]]\n* [[Shireen Baratheon]]\n* [[Melisandre]]\n* [[Patchface]]\n* [[Bowen Marsh]]\n* [[Satin]]\n* [[Axell Florent]]\n* [[Narbert Grandison]]\n* [[Benethon Scales]]\n* [[Brus Buckler]] \n* [[Patrek of King\'s Mountain]] \n* [[Dorden the Dour]]\n* [[Malegorn of Redpool]]\n* [[Lambert Whitewater]]\n* [[Perkin Follard]]\n* [[Cotter Pyke]]\n* [[Tycho Nestoris]]\n* [[Wun Weg Wun Dar Wun]]\n* [[Leathers]]\n* [[Hardin]]\n* [[Dolorous Edd]]\n* [[Jeor Mormont]]\n* [[Stannis]]\n* [[Robert Baratheon]]\n* [[Tommen]]\n* [[Roose Bolton]]\n* [[Eddard Stark]]\n* [[Salladhor Saan]]\n* [[Mother Mole]]\n* [[Maester Aemon]]\n* [[Samwell Tarly]]\n* [[Dareon]]\n* [[Paxter Redwyne]]\n* [[Val]]\n* [[Dalla]]\n* [[Mance Rayder]]\n* [[Mully]]\n* [[Ty]]\n* [[Dannel]]\n* [[Clydas]]\n* [[Arya Stark]]\n* [[Richard Horpe]]\n* [[Justin Massey]]\n* [[Godry Farring]]\n* [[Hobb]]\n* [[Cregan Karstark]]\n* [[Alys Karstark]]\n* [[Robb Stark]]\n* [[Arnolf Karstark]]\n* [[Harrion Karstark| Harry Karstark]]\n* [[Daryn Hornwood]]\n* [[Jaime Lannister]]\n* [[Jon Umber (Greatjon)]]\n* [[Torrhen Karstark | Torr Karstark]]\n* [[Eddard Karstark | Edd Karstark]]\n}}\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 44]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Jon Snow]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Castle Black]]\n\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 44]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 45, Jon]]</text>\n      <sha1>4bx64i8rwwnpc263sr5me74i1zrkje4</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 29</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5703</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>183417</id>\n      <parentid>164453</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-04-28T19:14:18Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2965">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Arya Stark|Arya]]\n| title\t\t= Arya V\n| place         = [[Stoney Sept]]\n| page\t\t= 327\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 28|Sansa III]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 29|Arya V]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 30|Jon IV]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 22|Arya IV]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 34|Arya VI]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File: Mustamirri_thereisthehound.JPG\xe2\x80\x8e\xe2\x80\x8e|Arya and Gendry look out the window to see what all the noise is about - by mustamirri \xc2\xa9|left|thumb|250px]]\n[[Harwin]] tells [[Arya Stark|Arya]] about the [[Battle of the Bells]], where [[Eddard Stark|her father]] defeated [[Jon Connington|Lord Connington]], [[Aerys II Targaryen]]\'s [[Hand of the King|Hand]], in a fierce battle fought in the streets of [[Stoney Sept]].

The [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] are granting [[Riverrun]] to Ser [[Emmon Frey]] and Kevan\xe2\x80\x99s sister [[Genna Lannister|Genna]], once the [[Brynden Tully|Blackfish]] has surrendered. They legitimize [[Ramsay Snow]] and name [[Roose Bolton]] [[Warden of the North]]. Ser [[Rolph Spicer]] is granted [[Castamere]], and raised to lord, and Lord [[Gawen Westerling]], [[Sybell Spicer|his wife]], and daughter [[Jeyne Westerling|Jeyne]] are all granted a royal pardon, along with Lord [[Jonos Bracken]], Lord [[House Vance|Vance]], Lord [[Lymond Goodbrook|Goodbrook]] and Lord [[William Mooton|Mooton]] for entering King Tommen\xe2\x80\x99s service. Jaime had recently lost during a spar with Ser [[Addam Marbrand]], and is disgusted that he cannot fight left-handed, especially after receiving the new [[Valyrian steel|Valyrian sword]] from [[Tywin Lannister|his father]].\n\nOutside, Jaime watches Steelshanks [[Walton]] and his men prepare to leave [[King\'s Landing]], and sees a girl who claims to be [[Arya Stark]]. Jaime is pretty sure she is not the real Arya, yet she is to be presented to Roose Bolton and Ramsay Bolton at the [[Dreadfort]]. Ser [[Gregor Clegane|Gregor]]\xe2\x80\x99s screams from [[Pycelle]]\xe2\x80\x99s solar can be heard throughout the [[Red Keep]], for Lord Tywin has demanded that the Grand Maester heal him so that the [[King\'s Justice]] can execute him (rather than dying from a poisoned spear) in the hopes of placating [[Dorne]] and [[House Martell]], who are likely to be outraged by Prince [[Oberyn Martell|Oberyn\'s]] death. Jaime recalls his father mentioning that [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] and his fleet have left [[Dragonstone]], leaving only a token force to guard the island. Unlike Pycelle, Tywin believes Stannis has not conceded defeat; he has only left Dragonstone because he intends to continue fighting elsewhere. He will likely fail if he goes to [[Storm\'s End]] and tries to rally the Stormlands, but if Stannis wins Dorne to his cause, he can prolong [[War of the Five Kings|the war]] for months or even years, so Tywin will not give Dorne any reason to side with Stannis.\n\nLater, [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] visits him in the [[Red Keep#White Sword Tower|White Sword Tower]], and reveals that their father plans to send her back to [[Casterly Rock]] so that he will have a free hand in raising Tommen, in addition to marrying Tommen to [[Margaery Tyrell]], but Jaime refuses to talk to their father to convince him otherwise. Their conversation turns to the subject of [[Bran Stark]]; Cersei berates him again for throwing the boy from the tower, but when Jaime questions her about [[catspaw|the assassin]] [[Catelyn Tully|Catelyn Stark]] accused them of sending after the boy, Cersei denies it. When Cersei mentions that [[Robert I Baratheon|Robert]] himself, at [[Winterfell]], said it would be kinder to put the boy out of his misery while alone with her and their children, Jaime figures out that it was [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], \'desperate for a pat on the head from that sot\', who sent the assassin to kill [[Bran Stark|Bran]], even though Cersei does not believe him when he tells her his suspicions, just as Jaime does not believe her when Cersei insists again that [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] is responsible for Joffrey\'s death. When she begins to unlace Jaime\xe2\x80\x99s breeches, he sends her off in anger.\n\nJaime then has [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]] and Ser [[Loras Tyrell|Loras]] brought before him, and the Knight of Flowers reveals that after speaking with the woman, he now believes she may be innocent. Ser Loras is dismissed, and Jaime reveals his belief that Tyrion is innocent, and that the girl sent north with Steelshanks was not the real Arya Stark; his father has found some [[Jeyne Poole|northern girl of a similar age and appearance]], and with her immediate family dead or missing, there is no one to say otherwise. Ser Jaime then commands Brienne to find and protect Lady Catelyn\xe2\x80\x99s daughters, as they had both pledged to do, and gives her the Valyrian sword he had so recently received from his father, explaining that it was forged from the metal taken from [[Eddard Stark]]\'s greatsword [[Ice]], melted down after his execution, saying, &quot;\'\'A sword so fine must bear a name. It would please me if you would call this one \xe2\x80\x98[[Oathkeeper]]\xe2\x80\x99....You\'ll be defending Ned Stark\'s daughter with Ned Stark\'s own steel...

While Drogo is hunting, Daenerys goes to the market where a wine merchant offers her a cask of wine. When Ser [[Jorah Mormont|Jorah]] insists that the merchant drink first, the merchant refuses and attempts to flee. When Drogo learns of the attempt to poison Daenerys, he makes the decision to attack the Seven Kingdoms. \n\n==Synopsis==    \nAfter taking his pleasure, [[Khal]] [[Drogo]] arises from the sleeping mats and declares that the [[Stallion Who Mounts the World]] has no need of an [[Iron Throne|iron chair]]. [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] reminds him that it is prophesized that the Stallion will ride to the ends of the earth, but Drogo responds that the earth ends at the black salt sea, which no horse can drink. Daenerys tries to explain ships to him, but Drogo is not interested and leaves to go hunting. She can only hope that if his hunting goes well he might return in a more receptive mood; maybe he will even kill a \'\'[[hrakkar]]\'\', the white lion of the plains. Although he is brave even by Dothraki standards, like all his people Drogo still fears the sea.\n\nDaenerys sends for Ser [[Jorah Mormont|Jorah]]. When he arrives, she pleads for help convincing her husband to ride west. Ser Jorah explains that Drogo has never seen the [[Seven Kingdoms]] and probably thinks of them as small islands like [[Lys]] or [[Lorath]]; the riches of the east seem a lot more tempting. He continues that she should have patience and not make [[Viserys Targaryen|her brother]]\xe2\x80\x99s mistake. Ser Jorah promises that eventually they will go home. The word \xe2\x80\x9chome\xe2\x80\x9d saddens her when she remembers that the Seven Kingdoms are a place she has never seen either, and she wonders if the \'\'[[dosh khaleen]]\'\' is her future. \n\nIn an attempt to cheer her up, Ser Jorah asks if she would like visit the [[Vaes Dothrak#Markets|Western Market]], where a great caravan has just arrived and may carry a letter from Magister [[Illyrio Mopatis|Illyrio]]. Daenerys likes this idea since it will be nice to see the treasures, to hear the sound of the [[Valyrian]] language, and (since Drogo is gone) to travel in a litter; she does not want to appear weak in front of her husband by not riding a horse.\n\nDaenerys finds the market quiet compared to the bazaars of the [[Free Cities]]. The caravans come from east and west not so much to sell to the Dothraki as to trade with each other. The Dothraki do not fully understand the concept of buying and selling, but the merchants are welcome as long as they do not disturb the peace or profane the [[Mother of Mountains]] and give the traditional gifts to the \'\'dosh khaleen\'\'. Daenerys enjoys the wonder and magic of the [[Vaes Dothrak#Markets|Eastern Market]], with its strange foods and people, but the Western Market reminds her of home. She tells Ser Jorah about how she loved to play in the bazaars of the Free Cities when she was a little girl even though they seldom had money to buy anything. She especially remembers the honeyfinger cakes of [[Tyrosh]]. When she asks if they have such cakes in the Seven Kingdoms, Ser Jorah is unable to say.\n\nSer Jorah asks her pardon to seek out the merchant captain to ask about letters from Illyrio, but when Daenerys offers to join him he is insistent that he go alone. Daenerys finds this curious and wonders if the knight plans to visit a brothel afterwards. Daenerys wanders joyfully around for half of the morning, even laughing for the first time since her brother\xe2\x80\x99s death. As per Dothraki custom she receives several items as gifts and reciprocates with medallions from her belt.\n\nTurning a corner, they come upon a wine merchant offering thimbles of wines. Daenerys accepts a taste of the wine, speaking in Valyrian, which surprises the merchant, until [[Doreah]] steps up to declare all of Daenerys\xe2\x80\x99 titles. The merchant immediately insists that the wine he was going to offer her is not worthy of a princess and offers her a cask of his finest wine. Daenerys graciously accepts the cask, knowing that Drogo has acquired a taste for fine wine from his time in the Free Cities. \n\nAs Daenerys is ordering the cask taken back to the litter, Ser Jorah appears and states he wants a taste of the wine. The wine merchant resists, insisting that Ser Jorah is not fit for such wine, but relents and pours two cups when Ser Jorah threatens him. Then Ser Jorah orders the merchant to drink. Instead, the merchant throws the cask at Daenerys and flees. Ser Jorah pushes Daenerys out of the way and Doreah just barely catches her before she falls on her pregnant belly. [[Jhogo]] uses his whip to trip the merchant. The ruckus brings a dozen caravan guards and the merchant captain running. The merchant captain seems to guess what has happened. He orders the merchant taken away to await Khal Drogo and gives the merchant\xe2\x80\x99s goods to Daenerys as a gift. Daenerys asks Ser Jorah how he knew but the knight insists that he only suspected because the letter from Magister Illyrio had made him fearful. As they return, Daenerys notes that her baby is moving restlessly and she comforts him with words about being the blood of the dragon.\n\nWhen they get back to the hollow hummock that serves as her home, Daenerys orders the rest to leave her with Ser Jorah. The knight explains that the letter from Magister Illyrio brings news that [[Robert Baratheon|the Usurper]] has offered lands and a lordship to anyone that kills Daenerys and her child or her brother. Daenerys observes, with a laughing sob, that the Usurper owes Drogo a lordship for killing Viserys. \n\nDaenerys then thinks that the Usurper has woken her dragon and looks over to her dragon eggs. She commands Ser Jorah to light the brazier despite the heat and then asks him to leave. She then pushes the eggs under the coals, wondering if she is destroying the eggs. Nothing happens and Daenerys is very disappointed, but wonders even to herself what she was expecting.\n\nDrogo returns with the carcass of a \'\'hrakkar\'\' as the stars come out. After he has told her that he will make her a cloak of its skin, Daenerys tells him what has happened. Drogo becomes very quiet as Ser Jorah tells him that this will not be the last attempt. For their roles in saving his \'\'[[khaleesi]]\'\', Drogo gives Ser Jorah and Jhogo their choice of his horses. Drogo also proclaims a gift for his unborn son, [[Rhaego]]: the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. Drogo then swears to the Mother of Mountains that he will take his \'\'[[khalasar]]\'\' west and ride the wooden horses to Westeros to kill the men in the iron suits and tear down their stone houses. He vows to rape their women, take their children as slaves, and to bring their broken gods back to [[Vaes Dothrak]] to bow beneath the Mother of Mountains.\n\nTwo days later, the \'\'khalasar\'\' leaves Vaes Dothrak, headed southwest. The wine seller is forced to run naked, chained behind Daenerys\xe2\x80\x99 silver. No harm will come to the man, so long as he keeps up.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/09/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-26 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/055/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}  \n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 54]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Daenerys Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Vaes Dothrak]]\n\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 55, Daenerys]][[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\x94\xd1\x8d\xd0\xb9\xd0\xbd\xd0\xb5\xd1\x80\xd0\xb8\xd1\x81 VI]]</text>\n      <sha1>dlwqwk4d1qzowh74rn3662ojbldqzty</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Feast for Crows-Chapter 34</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5736</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>173807</id>\n      <parentid>166963</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-09-26T14:46:40Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Kirt</username>\n        <id>7339</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3675">{{Infobox Chapter AFfC\n| pov\t\t= [[Arya Stark]]\n| title\t\t= Cat of the Canals\n| place         = [[Braavos]]\n| page\t\t= 504\n| previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 33|Jaime V]]\n| current\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 34|Cat of the Canals]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 35|Samwell IV]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 22|Arya II]]\n| arc next\t= \n}}\n\n==Synopsis== \nAcclimated to the routine of Cat of the Canals, [[Arya Stark|Arya]] is learning the [[Braavosi tongue]] and trying to learn three new things every time she is sent forth from the [[House of Black and White]], as the [[kindly man]] told her she must. Selling clams by day, she sleeps in a bed with [[Brusco]]\'s daughters by night, and for three days during each black moon, she returns to the House of Black and White. She delivers all three things the kindly man wants her to learn, but he still sends her back to Brusco. He tells her of the [[Many-Faced God]]; especially how all religions are aware of him, even if they do not worship him. Even within [[Faith of the Seven|the Seven]] there exists [[the Stranger]], whom the kindly man calls &quot;Him of Many Faces&quot;. \n\nOne night when the black moon begins, she meets [[Dareon]] after he departs the Happy Port. Arya is angered by the singer\'s abandonment of his vows as a [[Night\'s Watch|black brother]]. Returning to Brusco\'s, she gives him the coin she has collected selling his mollusks and a pair of new boots, then heads to the House of Black and White for three nights.\n  \nThe [[waif]] teaches her how to identify certain poisons like [[Sweetsleep]] and the [[Tears of Lys]], and then tells her the full story of how she came to the temple. She claims to be the eldest child from an ancient house, but when her stepmother had a true daughter, the woman tried to poison the waif. When her father discovered this, he delivered two-thirds of his wealth to the House of Black and White, and soon after, his second wife was dead and the waif now a servant in the temple. She reveals that she lied about part of that tale, but before Arya can guess which part, the kindly man visits her. She tells him the three new things she has learned, finishing with the knowledge that Dareon is dead- his throat was slit and his body dumped in the canal. When the kindly man asks who killed him, she replies, &quot;Arya of [[House Stark]].&quot; The priest again asks her who she is, to which she answers, &quot;no one&quot;. But, as always, he tells her she lies, then asks the waif to bring Arya some warm milk to help her sleep. Arya goes to bed, but upon awakening in the morning, she discovers that she is blind.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Arya Stark]]\n*[[Kindly man]]\n*[[Brusco]]\n*[[Dareon]]\n*[[Waif]]\n}}\t\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Braavosi tongue]]\n*[[House of Black and White]]\n*[[Many-Faced God]]\n*[[Faith of the Seven]]\n*[[the Stranger]]\n*[[Night\'s Watch|black brother]]\n*[[Sweetsleep]]\n*[[Tears of Lys]]\n*[[House Stark]]\n}}\n\n\n==References and Notes== \n*The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/07/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-feast-for-crows-part-24 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Feast for Crows, Part 24].

At every step of Stannis\' speech, Jon clarifies whom he credits with doing the actual deeds. Stannis asks Jon if there is honor in [[Mance Rayder]], and the young man claims there is. The King speaks of the war that Melisandre has seen in her flames, and he confides that Jon may have a part in the upcoming battle. Stannis offers to legitimize Jon and name him Lord of [[Winterfell]], a goal he considers especially important due to all the strife occurring in [[the North]]. Stannis intends to let the [[wildlings]] through [[the Wall]], and settle them in the [[Gift]], should they pledge fealty and accept the [[Lord of Light]] as their god. He also presumes to marry his loyal Lord of Winterfell to [[Val]] to solidify his peace with the wildlings, however Jon would have to adopt Stannis\' faith and burn the godswood of Winterfell.

He is considering all the ill luck throughout his life, starting as a squire, where in a battle against the [[Kingswood Brotherhood]] he got hit on the head so hard he was unable to ever truly fight again, which left him unable to reach knighthood. [[Walder Frey|His father]] has always mocked him as &quot;Merrett Muttonhead&quot;, and all he was good for during the [[Red Wedding]] was to drink the [[Jon Umber (Greatjon)|Greatjon]] under the table. \n\nMerrett recollects how his father ordered the massacre of the [[House Stark|Starks]] at [[Edmure Tully]]\xe2\x80\x99s wedding, but it was [[Lothar Frey|Lame Lothar]] and [[Roose Bolton]] who had masterminded the whole affair. He considers how things at the [[Twins]] will turn worse for him when his father dies, as [[Ryman Frey|Ryman]] stands to inherit, and his sons [[Edwyn Frey|Edwyn]] and [[Walder Frey (son of Ryman)|Black Walder]] after him. Merrett feels that if he could accomplish this task, maybe his luck would change for the better, considering that Petyr is Ser Ryman\xe2\x80\x99s son. However, he has failed at everything in his life, including his role in keeping the Greatjon too drunk to fight. The man killed or maimed four men, and it took eight to finally get him in chains. \n\nWhen he reaches the site of King [[Tristifer IV Mudd|Tristifer]]\xe2\x80\x99s sepulcher, he finds the outlaws who captured Petyr. They surround him and take the gold he carried for the ransom. Merrett demands to see [[Beric Dondarrion]], but [[Lem]] and [[Tom of Sevenstreams|Tom]] inform him that the Lightning Lord was needed elsewhere. They lead him to the tree from which Petyr Pimple is hanging, and then Lem ties a noose around Merrett\xe2\x80\x99s neck. Sick with fear after they have lied about the ransom and now mean to hang him, Merrett pleads that he had nothing to do with the Red Wedding, and that they have no witness.

The man indicates that the [[Ramsay Snow|Bastard of Bolton]] is offering gold for wolfskins and for word on the walking dead. Later, [[Meera Reed|Meera]] tells a story of a hero who might have been a [[Crannogmen|crannogman]] (judging from other characters in the story, presumably [[Howland Reed]]), during the [[year of the false spring]]. This crannogman had left [[Greywater Watch]] and visited the [[children of the forest|Green Men]] on the [[Isle of Faces]]. Returning home, he stopped at [[Harrenhal]] for the [[Tourney at Harrenhal|great tourney]]. Three squires accosted him and mocked him for his short stature, knocking him to the ground until he was rescued by a [[Lyanna Stark|she-wolf]]. The story names no names, but from their references, we know who they are.\n\nThe story tells of [[Jaime Lannister]] being named to the [[Kingsguard]], despite [[Tywin Lannister|his father]]\'s absence (Tywin had recently resigned as [[Hand of the King|Hand]]). The [[Brandon Stark|Wild Wolf]] had asked [[Ashara Dayne]], one of princess [[Elia Martell|Elia]]\'s ladies-in-waiting, to dance with his [[Eddard Stark|shy brother]]. [[Benjen Stark|The pup]] offered the crannogman some armor so that he could take his vengeance on the squires during the tourney, but the little man turned him down. The crannogmen prayed to the [[old gods]], and the next day at the tourney, a [[mystery knight]] called the [[Knight of the Laughing Tree]] defeated the knights whose squires had wronged the crannogman. Instead of collecting a ransom from the three defeated knights, the mystery knight asked them to teach their squires honor. The Knight of the Laughing Tree disappeared before he could be unmasked, despite the fury of King [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys II]]. The tourney was won by prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]], but Meera ends the story by saying that what happened next is a sadder tale that deserves its own telling. Bran has never heard this story before, and both Reeds are surprised that Lord Eddard never related it to him.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Bran Stark]]\n*[[Ramsay Snow]]\n*[[Meera Reed]]\n*[[Lyanna Stark]]\n*[[Jaime Lannister]]\n*[[Tywin Lannister]]\n*[[Brandon Stark]]\n*[[Ashara Dayne]]\n*[[Elia Martell]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n*[[Benjen Stark]]\n*[[Knight of the Laughing Tree]]\n*[[Aerys II Targaryen]]\n*[[Rhaegar Targaryen]]\n}}\t\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[the Wall]]\n*[[House Liddle]]\n*[[Crannogmen]]\n*[[year of the false spring]]\n*[[Greywater Watch]]\n*[[children of the forest|Green Men]]\n*[[Isle of Faces]]\n*[[Harrenhal]]\n*[[Tourney at Harrenhal]]\n*[[Kingsguard]]\n*[[Hand of the King]]\n*[[old gods]]\n*[[mystery knight]]\n}}\n\n\n==References and Notes==\n* The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/01/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-14 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Part 14].

They are the last descendants of [[House Targaryen]], the previous royal House of the [[Seven Kingdoms]]. Viserys plans to marry Daenerys to [[Khal]] [[Drogo]] of the [[Dothraki]] [[horselord]]s in exchange for an army to reclaim their [[Aerys II Targaryen|father]]\'s [[Iron Throne|throne]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Viserys Targaryen]] presents his thirteen-year-old sister, Daenerys, with a fine silk dress. The dress is a gift from their host [[Magister]] [[Illyrio Mopatis]] of [[Pentos]], who has also promised gold and jewels so she will look like a princess. Daenerys questions Illyrio\'s motives, but Viserys insists that the Magister only wants to earn his good graces for when he reclaims the [[Seven Kingdoms]]. Daenerys still doesn\'t trust Illyrio, but knows better than to say anything for fear of making Viserys angry (which he calls &quot;waking the [[dragon]]&quot;). \n\nViserys is preparing to present Daenerys to the [[Dothraki]] [[horselord]], [[Khal]] [[Drogo]], in the hope that the \'\'khal\'\' will take her as his wife in exchange for soldiers to reclaim the [[Iron Throne]] of the Seven Kingdoms. He warns Daenerys not to fail him and wake the dragon, twisting one of her nipples for emphasis. Viserys adds that when they write the history of his reign they will say it began this night.\n\n[[File:Aprilis420 targaryen.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Daenerys and Viserys Targaryen]]\n\nAfter Viserys leaves, Daenerys thinks of [[Westeros]], a place she has never seen. She recalls the stories of her brother Crown Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]]\'s [[Battle of the Trident|death]] at the hand of [[Robert Baratheon]], her father King [[Aerys II Targaryen]]\'s murder by [[Jaime Lannister|the Kingslayer]], and her [[Rhaella Targaryen|mother]] and brother\'s escape to [[Dragonstone]], where her mother died giving birth to her. Daenerys also recalls how she and her brother fled Dragonstone with Ser [[Willem Darry]] and four loyal men, who took them to [[Braavos]]. There they lived in a big [[The house with the red door in Braavos|house with a red door]] and Ser Willem was always kind to her. But when Ser Willem died, the servants stole what money was left and put them out of the house. Since then they have wandered, with Viserys keeping them moving in fear of the Usurper\xe2\x80\x99s assassins. Near the end of her reverie, Dany reflects on how Viserys, now known as &quot;the Beggar King&quot; behind his back, has become obsessed with recovering his throne, while she only wants her childhood back.\n\nIllyrio\'s servants come to bathe Daenerys and prepare her for her meeting with Khal Drogo. She is intended to marry Drogo, though she has always assumed she would marry her brother like the [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]] always have. The servants tell her how lucky she is to marry a man so rich that even his slaves wear golden collars. Once she is properly dressed, her brother returns with Magister Illyrio. Viserys commands her to stand up and turn around. Illyrio showers Daenerys with compliments while Viserys complains she is too skinny and too young. Illyrio reassures him that she is old enough for the \'\'khal\'\' and comments on her silver-gold hair and purple eyes, the hallmarks of old [[Valyria|Valyrian]] nobility. When Viserys states that barbarians are said to have queer tastes such as boys and sheep, Illyrio warns him not to say these things to Khal Drogo, creating a flare of anger in Viserys\xe2\x80\x99 eyes.\n\nThe three of them journey in Illyrio\'s litter to Khal Drogo\'s manse in the pitch dark. Viserys states that 10,000 Dothraki screamers will be enough to overthrow the usurper when combined with those that are just awaiting his return. He speculates on those who would join their cause: [[House Tyrell]], [[House Redwyne]], [[House Darry]], [[House Greyjoy]], and the [[Dorne|Dornishmen]]. Illyrio assures Viserys that the [[Seven Kingdoms]] secretly await his return, though Daenerys doubts him.\n[[File:John MatsonViserys TargaryenII.png|Viserys tells Dany to stop crying. \xc2\xa9 FFG|thumb|350px|right]]\nIllyrio says that the horselord\'s mansion was a gift from the magisters of [[Pentos]], to help win Drogo\'s friendship. They arrive at the mansion and are announced as King Viserys III and Princess Daenerys. Illyrio points out several prominent guests, including Ser [[Jorah Mormont]], who has fled the Seven Kingdoms under sentence of death and spent much time among the Dothraki. Illyrio then points out Khal Drogo himself, who is as graceful as a panther, and younger than Daenerys would have thought. Viserys notes his long braid, which means he has never been defeated in combat. Daenerys only notes his cold, hard face and is afraid of him. She asks to go home, provoking a rant from Viserys about how their [[King\'s Landing|home]] has been taken away from them. Daenerys only meant their rooms in Illyrio\xe2\x80\x99s estate, but none of the places they have stayed in have been Viserys\' home. Viserys also assures Daenerys that he would let Khal Drogo\'s whole \'\'[[khalasar]]\'\', including their horses, rape her if it won him back the Seven Kingdoms. Then Viserys tells her to stop crying, because Illyrio is leading Khal Drogo over to meet them. Daenerys stops crying, stands up straight, and smiles.\n\n==Character List Appearing/Mentioned==\n{{Columns|4|\n*[[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n*[[Drogo]]\n*[[Illyrio Mopatis]]\n*[[Jorah Mormont]]\n*[[Moro]]\n*[[Rhogoro]]\n*[[Viserys Targaryen]]\n*[[Aegon I Targaryen]]\n*[[Elia Martell]]\n*[[Rhaegar Targaryen]]\n*[[Willem Darry]]\n}}\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|4|\n*[[Braavos]]\n*[[Casterly Rock]]\n*[[Dorne]]\n*[[Dragonstone]]\n*[[Eyrie]]\n*[[Highgarden]]\n*[[Isle of Faces]]\n*[[Jade Sea]]\n\n*[[King\'s Landing]]\n*[[Lys]]\n*[[Myr]]\n*[[Free Cities|Nine Free Cities]]\n*[[Pentos]]\n*[[Port of Ibben]]\n*[[Qohor]]\n*[[Seven Kingdoms]]\n\n*[[Summer Islands|Summer Isles]]\n*[[Trident]]\n*[[Tyrosh]]\n*[[Vaes Dothrak]]\n*[[Vale of Arryn]]\n*[[Valyria]]\n*[[Volantis]]\n*[[Westeros]]\n*[[Andal]]\n\n*[[Battle of the Trident]]\n*[[Bloodrider]]\n*[[House Darry]]\n*[[Doom of Valyria]]\n*[[Dothraki]]\n*[[Dragon|Dragon]]\n*[[First Men]]\n*[[Free City]]\n*[[House Greyjoy]]\n*[[High Septon]]\n\n*[[Horselord]]\n*[[Iron Throne]]\n*[[Khal]]\n*[[Khalasar]]\n*[[Kingslayer]]\n*[[House Lannister]]\n*[[Lord of Light]]\n*[[Magister]]\n*[[House Martell]]\n*[[Night\'s Watch]]\n\n*[[House Redwyne]]\n*[[Rhaesh Andahli]]\n*[[Rhoynar]]\n*[[Spiceflower]]\n*[[House Stark]]\n*[[Sunset Kingdoms]]\n*[[House Targaryen]]\n*[[House Tyrell]]\n*[[Unsullied]]\n*[[Usurper]]\n}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/03/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-2 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2009/05/cateyln-daenerys.html Humorous review of the chapter]\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/004/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 03]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Daenerys Targaryen|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 03]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Pentos]]\n\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 04, Daenerys]][[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\x94\xd1\x8d\xd0\xb9\xd0\xbd\xd0\xb5\xd1\x80\xd0\xb8\xd1\x81 I]]</text>\n      <sha1>1d2yi954nnywz0t4rtm64oq0inwtzay</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Game of Thrones-Chapter 21</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>3826</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>183414</id>\n      <parentid>165964</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-04-28T19:12:52Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6838">{{Infobox Chapter AGoT\n| pov\t\t= [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n| place         = [[Castle Black]]\n| title\t\t= Tyrion III\n| page\t\t= \n| previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 20|Eddard IV]]\n| current\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 21|Tyrion III]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 22|Arya II]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 13|Tyrion II]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 31|Tyrion IV]]\n}} __NOTOC__\n\n[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] dines with high officers of the [[Night\'s Watch]] and promises [[Lord Commander of the Night\'s Watch|Lord Commander]] [[Jeor Mormont|Mormont]] that he will speak to the [[Robert Baratheon|king]] of their need. Afterwards, while paying a final visit to [[the Wall]], Tyrion meets [[Jon Snow]], who asks Tyrion to do what he can to help his brother [[Bran Stark|Bran]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] is dining with the high officers of the [[Night\'s Watch]] on his last night at [[Castle Black]]. [[Lord Commander of the Night\'s Watch|Lord Commander]] [[Jeor Mormont|Mormont]] proclaims Tyrion a cunning man and asks him if he must leave so soon, saying that [[the Wall]] needs men like him. Tyrion brushes off the suggestion with an offer to scour the [[Seven Kingdoms]] for dwarfs. An offended Ser [[Alliser Thorne]] claims that Tyrion mocks the Watch, but Tyrion counters that he is only mocking Ser Alliser. Thorne demands that Tyrion make his japes with steel in hand. Tyrion replies that he already has steel in his hand: a fork, which he brandishes against Thorne in a mock attack. A roar of laughter rises from the other officers and Ser Alliser leaves in disgust.\n\nAfter claiming Ser Alliser\xe2\x80\x99s meal as his spoils of victory, Tyrion comments that a man like Ser Alliser should be mucking out the stable, not drilling the recruits. Mormont takes the opportunity to complain about the quality of his men; Ser Alliser is one of the few living knights to have taken the black. Ser [[Jaremy Rykker]] goes on to explain that both he and Thorne fought for King [[Aerys II Targaryen]] during the [[Sack of King\'s Landing]] and were forced to take the black or be executed by Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s father, Lord [[Tywin Lannister]]. Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s only comment is that his father is indeed very fond of heads on spikes.\n\nTyrion asks for more wine and [[Bowen Marsh]] comments that he has a great thirst for a small man. [[Maester Aemon]] states that Tyrion is a giant among them at the edge of the world. Tyrion, speechless at being called a giant, calls the maester kind, which leaves the maester equally amused.\n\nWhen they retire to the fire, Mormont informs Tyrion that he will receive an escort as far as [[Winterfell]]. Tyrion soon realizes that the Lord Commander is working his way up to asking a favor and so cuts right to it by asking if there is any way he can repay the Watch\xe2\x80\x99s kindness. Mormont beseeches Tyrion to speak to King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] about the condition of the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch and its need for men. Mormont goes on to elaborate on the high rate of disappearance among their ranging parties, including Ser [[Waymar Royce]] and [[Benjen Stark]]. The Watch\xe2\x80\x99s strength is now under a thousand men, leaving only three men to guard each mile of the Wall. Then Mormont laments that he is old and there is no one qualified to take over command because the Watch has become an army of sullen boys and old men. He has maybe 20 men that can read, and fewer who can think or lead. Tyrion promises that he will tell the King, his father, and his brother but he knows that it will do no good. \n\nMormont then asks Tyrion how many winters he has seen. When Tyrion replies with nine, Mormont adds that they have all been short. The long summer is ending and portents say a long winter is coming. When Tyrion suggest the fabled endless summer may have come, Mormont insists the days are already growing shorter. Mormont then confides to Tyrion that the [[wildlings]] are massing and moving south, running scared from something worse than just the cold. Tyrion, bored by Mormont\xe2\x80\x99s dark words, reiterates his promises and leaves.\n\nOutside it is bitter cold. As he walks the castle ground, Tyrion is taken by a whim to climb the Wall one last time. His legs are cramping too much to climb the stairs, so Tyrion takes the winch cage up. At the top he meets [[Jon Snow]] with [[Ghost]]. As they walk, Tyrion asks how the recruits are doing under Jon\xe2\x80\x99s instruction. Jon tells him that they are getting better.\n\nTyrion offers to carry any messages that Jon might have south to Winterfell and is rewarded with a torrent of requests. Most of all Jon wants Tyrion to help his crippled brother [[Bran Stark|Bran]]. At first, Tyrion denies that has anything to offer Bran, but Jon insists that words will be enough. When Tyrion agrees, Jon thanks him from the heart and calls him \xe2\x80\x9cfriend.\xe2\x80\x9d Tyrion, deeply moved by the gesture, quips that while many of his kin are bastards, Jon is the first that he could call a friend, and they shake hands.\n\nThey both look out over the [[Haunted Forest]] north of the Wall. As they watch, Jon says that he has been watching for his Uncle Benjen. Tyrion assures Jon that Benjen will return one day. When Jon declares that if his uncle does not come back he and Ghost will go north to find him, Tyrion wonders who will go out searching for Jon and shivers at the thought.\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:20;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n* [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n* [[Jeor Mormont]]\n* [[Alliser Thorne]]\n* [[Bowen Marsh]]\n* [[Jaremy Rykker]]\n* [[Aemon Targaryen]]\n* [[Jon Snow]]\n* [[Ghost]]\n| style=&quot;width:20;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentionend:\'\'\'\n* [[Jaime Lannister]]\n* [[Tywin Lannister]]\n* [[Jyck]]\n* [[Morrec]]\n* [[Maege Mormont]]\n| style=&quot;width:20;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentionend:\'\'\'\n* [[Eddard Stark]]\n* [[Halder]]\n* [[Benjen Stark]]\n* [[Waymar Royce]]\n* [[Yohn Royce]]\n| style=&quot;width:20;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentionend:\'\'\'\n* [[Gared]]\n* [[Denys Mallister]]\n* [[Yoren]]\n* [[Pypar]]\n* [[Robert Baratheon]]\n| style=&quot;width:20;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentionend:\'\'\'\n* [[Grenn]]\n* [[Robb Stark]]\n* [[Mikken]]\n* [[Rickon Stark]]\n* [[Bran Stark]]\n|}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2009/05/eddard-tyrion_20.html Humorous review of the chapter]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/06/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-11 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/022/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 21]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Tyrion Lannister|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 21]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Castle Black]]\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 21]]\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 22, Tyrion]]\n[[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\xa2\xd0\xb8\xd1\x80\xd0\xb8\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbd III]]</text>\n      <sha1>ozx23skhnw7uarm70uf70lub0j1pvwl</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Game of Thrones-Chapter 59</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6019</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>195752</id>\n      <parentid>166002</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-11-23T01:11:22Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaena Targaryen</username>\n        <id>4705</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <minor/>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9646">{{Infobox Chapter AGoT\n| pov\t\t= [[Catelyn Tully]]\n| place         = [[The Twins]]\n| title\t\t= Catelyn IX\n| page\t\t= 532\n| previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 58|Eddard XV]]\n| current\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 59|Catelyn IX]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 60|Jon VIII]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 55|Catelyn VIII]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 63|Catelyn X]]\n}} __NOTOC__\n\n[[Robb Stark|Robb]]\xe2\x80\x99s host arrives at [[the Twins]], where [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] negotiates their crossing of the [[Trident#Green Fork|Green Fork]] with Lord [[Walder Frey]].\n\n==Synopsis==    \n[[Catelyn Tully|Catelyn\xe2\x80\x99s]] apprehensions grow as [[Robb Stark|Robb]]\xe2\x80\x99s host moves south towards [[the Twins]]. She fears for [[Hoster Tully|her father]], [[Edmure Tully|her brother]], [[Eddard Stark|her husband]], her daughters, and her sons in [[Winterfell]]. However, there is nothing she can do for any of them, so she must save her strength for Robb and for that she must be as fierce and hard as the north.  \n\nAs she watches her son\xe2\x80\x99s actions, Catelyn realizes that he has learned so much from Ned, but worries about what he has not learned. Ser [[Brynden Tully|Brynden]] leads a hundred outriders to scout and screen their movements. His reports state that Lord [[Walder Frey]] has gathered 4,000 men at [[the Twins]] and that Lord [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin\xe2\x80\x99s]] host is days to the south. Lord Frey should have gone south to join the host at [[Riverrun]]. When Catelyn rides forward, Robb is telling his companion of the day that Lord Frey must be waiting to join his power to theirs. Catelyn reminds her son that if he expects nothing from Lord Frey he will never be surprised and that Lord Frey was always too friendly with the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] for a bannerman to [[House Tully]].\n\nAfter they make camp, [[Theon Greyjoy]] brings another report from Ser Brynden. A dozen Lannister scouts have been killed, and the Lannister force under Ser [[Addam Marbrand]] is retreating south, burning as they go. Theon declares there is no way the Lannisters will know they have split their forces, but Catelyn cautions that Walder Frey may tell them. She encourages them to place archers to kill any ravens leaving the Twins, but Theon says it has already been done. \n\nAs she wonders what the Freys have been doing, Catelyn is told that there has been some fighting between the Freys and Marbrand\xe2\x80\x99s men, but most of the Frey strength is at the Twins. This gives hope to Robb that Lord Frey will honor his vows, but Catelyn points out that it is one thing to protect one\xe2\x80\x99s land and another to engage in open battle. \n\nThe only way across the [[Trident#Green Fork|Green Fork]] north of the [[Ruby Ford]] is the bridge at the Twins, especially with the river running high and no wood for rafts. Theon suggests that they can storm the Twin if they must (they have five times Lord Frey\xe2\x80\x99s numbers), but Catelyn responds that it would not be easy. There is also no time; while they laid siege to the Twins, Lord Tywin would bring up his host and attack from the rear. Catelyn can see that Robb is unsure as he asks her what his father would do. Catelyn insists that he would find a way across no matter what it takes.\n\nSer Brynden arrives with the dire news that Edmure\xe2\x80\x99s host has been [[Battle of Riverrun|defeated]] under the walls of Riverrun and scattered. Edmure himself has been wounded and captured, but some survivors have taken refuge inside Riverrun. Other news is that Lord Frey has withdrawn his strength inside his twin castles. Robb is frustrated, and states that he will pull the walls down around Lord Frey. Catelyn rebukes him, saying he sounds like a sulky boy and that sometimes words are needed. She explains that the Freys have never failed to extract their toll in the 600 years that they have controlled the crossing. What this toll will be, they have yet to learn but if Robb is unwilling to pay the toll, the only option Catelyn can see is to retreat to [[Moat Cailin]] to meet Lord Tywin in battle. She rides away, not wanting to make it seem that she was usurping Robb\xe2\x80\x99s authority and asks herself if her husband has taught their son wisdom, or how to kneel.\n\n[[File:MKomarck TheTwinsFrey.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Twins]]\n\nIt is near midday when they arrive at the Twins, two ugly stout castles on either side of the Green Fork with a wide bridge between them. The Freys have gotten rich off the tolls from this bridge. Upon seeing the castles, the northern lords can see it would be very nearly impossible to take by storm. A dozen knights led by Ser [[Stevron Frey]], heir to Lord Walder, come forward from the sally port. Ser Stevron asks who leads and Robb rides forward to be told that Lord Walder invites him to share meat and mead with him in the castle and explain his purpose. None of Robb\xe2\x80\x99s lords like this, fearing that Robb could easily be captured and sold to the Lannisters. Catelyn can tell that Stevron is not pleased by the accusations, and attempts to save the negotiations by volunteering to go herself. There are objections, but she tells them that Lord Walder is her father\xe2\x80\x99s bannerman and will not harm her, hoping it is true. It is agreed and Stevron\xe2\x80\x99s brother, Ser [[Perwyn Frey]], remains as a hostage to her fair treatment.\n\n[[File:Old Walder Frey.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Lord Walder Frey of the Twins]]\n\nThe frail 90-year-old Lord Walder Frey meets Catelyn in the great hall with all but one (the hostage, Perwyn) of his 21 sons, 36 grandsons, and countless other descendants. Walder is impolite and direct; even some of his sons point out his impoliteness, but he does not respond well to their criticism. Catelyn knows that she has to be careful with her words and explains that she is there to ask him to open his gates so they can proceed to Riverrun where she would have expected to find him. Lord Walder insists that he was still gathering his strength when her brother lost the battle. Catelyn doubts Lord Walder\xe2\x80\x99s version of events, but does not press the issue. She asks that they talk privately, and Lord Walder commands all the others to leave. \n\nOnce they are alone, Lord Walder declares that his descendants are all waiting for him to die, then he asks why he should let Robb\xe2\x80\x99s host cross. When Catelyn makes a very subtle threat about the size of Robb\xe2\x80\x99s army, Lord Walder retorts that her son\xe2\x80\x99s army will be 20,000 fresh corpses when the Lannisters arrive. When Catelyn reminds Lord Walder of his vows to [[House Tully]], the old man counters that he also swore allegiance to the king, making her and her son nothing but rebels. Lord Walder then takes his turn at threatening: if he had the sense the gods gave a fish he would deny them the crossing and let the Lannisters have them. However, the old man quickly reveals that he does not care for the Lannisters either, with their gold, their lions, and their arrogant pride. Lord Walder goes on to say that if the Lannisters want his help they must \'\'ask\'\'. Catelyn humbly stresses that \'\'she\'\' is asking, as are her father, her brother, her sons, and her husband with her voice.\n\nWalder complains about her father insulting him by not being present for his last few weddings; an insult despite Lord Hoster\xe2\x80\x99s failing health. The old man complains about Lord Hoster not marrying Edmure to one of his daughters, then he complains about how his heirs were defeated in a tourney he attended. He also complains that [[Jon Arryn]] would not foster two of his grandsons, or let him foster [[Robert Arryn]]. When Lord Arryn announced that his son was going to be fostered with Lord [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]], [[Lysa Tully|Lysa]] stormed off and all the Jon could do was apologize. Catelyn asks if it was not Lord Tywin that Robert Arryn was to be fostered with, but Lord Walder insists that he knows the difference between Stannis and Tywin. Then Lord Walder asks again why he should allow them to cross and the haggling begins.\n\nCatelyn returns to Robb followed by Ser [[Jared Frey]], Ser [[Hosteen Frey]], Ser [[Danwell Frey]], Walder\xe2\x80\x99s bastard [[Ronel Rivers]], and a long column of pikemen. She tells Robb that he has been granted the crossing and that all but 400 of Lord Frey\xe2\x80\x99s forces will join his army. In exchange, two of Lord Walder\xe2\x80\x99s grandsons will be fostered by the Starks at [[Winterfell]], [[Olyvar Frey]] will become Robb\xe2\x80\x99s squire, Arya will marry Walder\xe2\x80\x99s youngest son [[Elmar Frey|Elmar]], and Robb himself will marry his choice of Lord Walder\xe2\x80\x99s daughters when the fighting is done. Robb, realizing he has no choice if he wants to cross, consents. Catelyn suggests that he should leave 400 archers and swordsmen at the Twins to ensure Lord Walder keeps faith under a reliable man. Robb suggests Ser [[Helman Tallhart]] and Catelyn agrees.\n\nRobb and his cavalry cross that evening as Lord Walder Frey watches from a litter while [[Roose Bolton]] and the infantry stay on the east bank to march south and confront Lord Tywin.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/10/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-29 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/060/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 59]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Catelyn Tully]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in the Twins]]\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 59]]\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 60, Catelyn]][[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\x9a\xd0\xb5\xd0\xb9\xd1\x82\xd0\xb8\xd0\xbb\xd0\xb8\xd0\xbd IX]]</text>\n      <sha1>preqr2czu3qtaj5awsm22fmlmnt83lt</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 27</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5768</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>163268</id>\n      <parentid>98420</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-03-28T15:22:05Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Frernok</username>\n        <id>5007</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <comment>/*References and Notes*/ Slynt</comment>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4494">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]]\n| title\t\t= Daenerys III\n| place         = [[Astapor]]\n| page\t\t= 304\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 26|Jon III]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 27|Daenerys III]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 28|Sansa III]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 23|Daenerys II]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 42|Daenerys IV]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] tells the slavers that she wants all eight thousand [[Unsullied]], plus all the slave boys in training, whether they\xe2\x80\x99ve been cut yet or not. In order to pay the slave masters, Daenerys offers all three of her ships as well as [[Drogon]], for the price of a dragon is incalculable. Daenerys frees [[Missandei]] and takes her into her service, revealing that she can speak [[High Valyrian]]. We learn that [[Valar Morghulis]] means \xe2\x80\x98all men must die\xe2\x80\x99. \n\nThat night, [[Quaithe]] appears to Daenerys, seemingly in a dream, telling her again, &quot;To go north, you must journey south. To reach the west, you must go east. To go forward you must go back, and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow.&quot; When the time for the deal to be brokered arrives, Daenerys swings the slaver\xe2\x80\x99s whip in [[Kraznys mo Nakloz|Kraznys]]\xe2\x80\x99 face, and releases Drogon on him, shouting, &quot;Drogon! Dracarys!&quot; This is the sign for her followers to attack the slavers. With the help of the Unsullied who obey her as she is now their owner she has the slavers killed. The other slaves join her and soon [[Astapor]] is conquered. \n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n*[[Missandei]]\n*[[Grazdan]]\n*[[Irri]]\n*[[Jhiqui]]\n*[[Barristan Selmy|Whitebeard]]\n*[[Belwas]]\n*[[Aggo]]\n*[[Jhogo]]\n*[[Rakharo]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Jorah Mormont]]\n*[[Kraznys mo Nakloz]]\n*[[Drogon]]\n*[[Viserion]]\n*[[Rhaegal]]\n*[[Groleo]]\n*[[Quaithe]]\n*[[The Silver]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Grazdan (Great)|Grazdan the Great]]\n*[[Viserys Targaryen]]\n*[[Rhaella Targaryen]]\n*[[Aegon I Targaryen]]\n*[[Aerys II Targaryen]]\n*[[Eroeh]]\n*[[Drogo|Khal Drogo]]\n*[[Mago]]\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n*[[Rhaegar Targaryen]]\n|}\n\n==Places and Terms Mentioned==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[Qarth]]\n*[[Astapor]]\n*[[Westeros]]\n*[[Ghis|Old Ghis]]\n*[[Seven Kingdoms]]\n*[[Valyria]]\n*[[Valyrian Freehold]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[Ghiscari Empire]]\n*[[Plaza of Pride]]\n*[[Trident]]\n*[[House of the Undying|Palace of Dust]]\n*[[Red Waste]]\n*[[Worm River]]\n*[[Plaza of Punishment]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[Good Masters]]\n*[[Bloodrider]]\n*[[House Mormont]]\n*[[Common Tongue]]\n*[[Ghiscari]]\n*[[Tokar]]\n*[[Unsullied]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*\'\'[[Balerion (ship)|Balerion]]\'\'\n*\'\'[[Vhagar (ship)|Vhagar]]\'\'\n*\'\'[[Meraxes (ship)|Meraxes]]\'\'\n*[[Dragon]]\n*[[Field of Fire]]\n*[[High Valyrian]]\n*[[Valar Morghulis]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*\'\'[[arakh]]\'\'\n*\'\'[[khaleesi]]\'\'\n*[[Lhazareen]]\n*[[Undying Ones]]\n*[[Dothraki]]\n*\'\'[[khalasar]]\'\'\n*[[House Targaryen]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[Zorse]]\n*[[Jogos Nhai]]\n*[[Dragonbone]]\n*[[Dracarys]]\n|}\n\n==References and Notes==\n*The synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/02/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-16 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Part 16].

Janos reveals that he will give Jon one last chance to prove his innocence, sending him to meet [[Mance Rayder]] as an envoy, but Jon must kill the [[wildling]] king. [[Beyond the Wall]], Jon meets [[Tormund]] who treats him with respect, almost as a friend. Jon is brought before Mance, and the king reveals that he is aware that the [[Night\'s Watch]] is nearly out of provisions and cannot hold out much longer.\n\nRayder then brings him to see the [[Horn of Winter]], which Mance claims they found back in the [[Frostfangs]], but only he and his trusted lieutenants knew about it. However, Mance does not wish to use the Horn, for if the songs can be believed, it will cause the Wall to collapse. The wildlings have come south not to conquer, but to escape the [[Others]]. Without the Wall, Mance\xe2\x80\x99s people would find no safe haven, even in the south, and that is something he does not wish to happen. Mance offers Jon the Horn of Winter if the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch will let his people pass the Wall and settle the lands to the south, although he will not abide the laws or taxes of the [[Seven Kingdoms]]. If the Watch refuses, Tormund Giantsbane will sound the [[Horn of Joramun]] in three days time.\n\nHowever, the parley is interrupted, as the wildlings have [[Battle of Castle Black|come under attack]] from the east by rangers from [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea|Eastwatch]]. Mance believes that it must be [[Cotter Pyke]], but a scout and [[Varamyr]], who is skinchanged inside [[Orell]]\'s eagle, tell Mance there are more iron-clad attackers coming from the north and east. When Orell\'s eagle bursts into flames, Varamyr runs screaming from the fray. [[Harma|Harma Dogshead\'s]] raiders charge through the rangers, but they are overwhelmed by [[knight]]s on heavy horse. Amongst their banners, Jon sees a [[House Velaryon|seahorse]], a [[House Caron|field of birds]], and a [[House Florent|ring of flowers]].

She is hesitant about her upcoming wedding. Daario asks her to marry him instead, but truly he knows that she cannot and will not. Outside the [[Yunkai]] are massing more ships, building siege weapons to throw rocks at the city. However, no rams or siege towers are built, as the siege is intended to cause famine and disease to force Meereen to succumb. \n\nDaario introduces Dany to the three [[Dorne|Dornishmen]] who say that they have specific gifts for the queen. [[Quentyn Martell]], [[Gerris Drinkwater]], and [[Archibald Yronwood]], who defected to Daario, reveal themselves to her. A parchment is presented, [[Secret marriage pact (made in Braavos)|describing a secret pact of alliance]] between Dorne and the Targaryens signed by [[Willem Darry]] and [[Oberyn Martell]], that would be sealed by a marriage between [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]] and [[Arianne Martell]]. Dany laughs when she learns who Quentyn is, as his mercenary nickname was Frog, and she remembers the story of a frog turning into a prince.\n\nDany remembers [[Quaithe]]\'s earlier prophecy. \'\'The glass Candles are burning. Soon comes the pale mare, and after her the others. Kraken and Dark flame, lion and griffin, the sun\'s son and the mummer\'s dragon. Trust none of them. Remember the Undying. Beware the perfumed seneschal\'\'. She recognizes Quentyn and the arms of [[House Martell]] as the sun\'s son she must be wary about.\n\nDaenerys refuses to marry Quentyn. The Dornishmen make one last plea before Dany\'s wedding which she denies, and then goes through with her marriage to [[Hizdahr zo Loraq]].\n[[File\xe2\x80\x8e:Marc_Fishman_Dany_wedding.jpg\xe2\x80\x8e|Dany\xe2\x80\x99s wedding procession- by Marc Fishman \xc2\xa9 |thumb|300px|left]]\n&lt;br clear=all&gt;\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n* [[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n* [[Daario Naharis]]\n* [[Serwyn]]\n* Khal [[Drogo]]\n* [[Barristan Selmy]] (Arstan Whitebeard)\n* [[Hizdahr zo Loraq]]\n* [[Quentyn Martell]]\n* [[Archibald Yronwood]]\n* [[Missandei]]\n* [[Irri]]\n* [[Reznak mo Reznak]]\n* [[Galazza Galare]]\n* [[Brown Ben Plumm]]\n* [[Jhiqui]]\n* [[Pretty Meris]]\n* [[Hugh Hungerford]]\n* [[Webber]]\n* [[Orson Stone]]\n* [[Lucifer Long]]\n* [[Will (of the Woods)|Will of the Woods]]\n* [[Dick Straw]]\n* [[Jack|Ginger Jack]]\n* [[Gerris Drinkwater]]\n* [[Strong Belwas]]\n* [[Skahaz mo Kandaq]]\n* [[Willem Darry]]\n* [[Oberyn Martell]]\n* [[Viserys Targaryen]]\n* [[Arianne Martell]]\n* [[Doran Martell]]\n* [[Robert Baratheon]]\n* [[Quaithe]]\n* [[Doreah]]\n* [[Rhaenys Targaryen (daughter of Rhaegar)|Rhaenys Targaryen]]\n* [[Aerys II Targaryen]]\n* [[Tywin Lannister]]\n* [[Ezzara]]\n}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 43]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Daenerys Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Meereen]]\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 43]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 44, Daenerys]]</text>\n      <sha1>bkldcsjtg96s31yqhklnbxv5jxwy6di</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Feast for Crows-Chapter 1</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5517</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>173801</id>\n      <parentid>166934</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-09-26T07:30:30Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4594">{{Infobox Chapter AFfC\n| pov\t\t= [[Aeron Greyjoy]]\n| title\t\t= The Prophet\n| place         = [[Great Wyk]] - [[Hammerhorn]] - [[Pebbleton]]\n| page\t\t= \n| previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Prologue|Prologue]] \n| current\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 1|The Prophet]] \n| next\t\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 2|The Captain of Guards]]\n| arc previous\t= \n| arc next\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 19|The Drowned Man]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Aeron Greyjoy]], who in the chapter is referred to as &quot;the prophet&quot;, is drowning men at a beach on [[Great Wyk]]. This a practice in which a worshiper of the [[Drowned God]] is held below the water until he drowns. The priest then resuscitates him. Through this initiation the person is stronger:\n:::\'\'{{:Feature_quote/4}}\'\'\n\n[[Gormond Goodbrother]] appears to bring Aeron to Lord [[Gorold Goodbrother]]. Aeron initially declines but relents when the messenger tells him [[Balon Greyjoy|the king]], Aeron\'s brother, is dead. During the journey Aeron remembers his brothers. His father married three times. The sons of his first wife died young. The eldest son from his second marriage was the strongest and fiercest of the remaining. Aeron admired Balon although they were not close in their youth. \n\nWhen they arrive at Lord Goodbrother\'s hall at [[Hammerhorn]], Aeron demands that everyone in the hall be sent away so that he and Gorold Goodbrother can speak privately. Lord Goodbrother insists that his [[Murenmure|maester]] will stay as well. Aeron disagrees and prepares to leave, but the maester stops him by informing him that [[Euron Greyjoy]] has occupied the [[Seastone Chair]]. Aeron is shocked. He remembers his brother but with little love. Goodbrother wants advice on whom to support, but Aeron wants to pray first and leaves for [[Pebbleton]].\n\nAgain Aeron thinks back to his youth. He was not a very religious man but rather a drunken sod. This changed when he fell overboard in a sea battle during [[Greyjoy Rebellion|Balon\'s Rebellion]]. He almost drowned and became a devoted follower of the Drowned God. \nAeron has discussed the succession with Balon. Though Balon wanted his daughter, [[Asha Greyjoy|Asha]], to succeed him, Aeron did not agree with having a woman rule the [[Iron Islands]]. [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] is a weakling and probably dead. Balon\'s eldest brother, [[Euron Greyjoy|Euron]], is ungodly and Aeron hates him. Thus Aeron makes up his mind; it must be [[Victarion Greyjoy|Victarion]]. \n\nA few days later, Aeron has arrived at [[Pebbleton]] and starts to preach. Asha has also claimed the throne. Now Aeron\'s followers and a number of lords look to him for advice on whom to support. During his preaching, he finds his inspiration: the Ironmen should elect the king in a [[Kingsmoot]] as they did in the old days. Every captain is to go to [[Nagga\'s Hill]] on [[Old Wyk]], the ancient place where the old kings were chosen. Aeron hears his followers take up his call and knows he has done the right thing.\n\n==Greyjoy family tree==\n{{Greyjoy_tree}}\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:20%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Aeron Greyjoy]]\n*[[Emmond]]\n*Lord [[House Sparr|Sparr]]\n*[[Steffarion Sparr]]\n*[[Gormond Goodbrother]]\n*[[Gorold Goodbrother]]\n*[[Gran Goodbrother]] \n| style=&quot;width:20%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Gysella Goodbrother]] \n*[[Gwin Goodbrother]] \n*Maester [[Murenmure]]\n*[[Greydon Goodbrother]]\n*Lord [[House Merlyn|Merlyn]]\n*[[Rus]]\n| style=&quot;width:20%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Greydon Goodbrother]]\n*[[Tarle]] the Thrice-Drowned\n*[[Balon Greyjoy]]\n*the [[Storm God]]\n*[[Quellon Greyjoy]]\n*[[Harlon Greyjoy]]\n*[[Quenton Greyjoy]]\n| style=&quot;width:20%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Donel Greyjoy]]  \n*[[Euron Greyjoy]]\n*[[Victarion Greyjoy]]\n*[[Urrigon Greyjoy]]\n*[[Robin Greyjoy]]\n*[[Dagmer|Dagmer Cleftjaw]]\n*[[Asha Greyjoy]]\n| style=&quot;width:20%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Theon Greyjoy]]\n*[[Victarion Greyjoy]]\n*[[Sawane Botley]]\n*[[Stannis Baratheon]]\n*[[Urras Ironfoot]]\n*[[Sylas Flatnose]]\n*[[Harrag Hoare]]\n|}\n==References and Notes==\n{{references}}\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/02/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-feast-for-crows-part-2 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Feast for Crows, Part 2].

In his dream, they are one and the same. He wakes up with his mouth dry and rusty with the taste of blood and his heart hammering in his chest. \n\n[[File:Pulled from the Rhoyne.jpg|350px|thumb|left|\xc2\xa9 Fantasy Flight Games]]\nTyrion learns that after being knocked overboard during the battle with the [[stone men]], he was rescued by [[Jon Connington]] and [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaegar)|the prince]] forbade the crew to throw him, near-dead, overboard. Tyrion is being treated with vinegar, to reduce the danger of an infection with [[greyscale]]. Prince Aegon is also still aboard and irritated about it; however, his companions insisted on keeping him safe, as [[Selhorys]], where the \'\'[[Shy Maid]]\'\' is currently docked, fears an imminent attack by an approaching [[Dothraki]] \'\'[[khalasar]]\'\' and they do not want to get caught up in the chaos. To pass the time, Tyrion goads Aegon into playing a game of \'\'[[cyvasse]]\'\' with him, using it as an opportunity to probe the boy for information. Aegon asks Tyrion about his [[Rhaegar Targaryen|real father]], but Tyrion can tell him little; he himself only saw Rhaegar once or twice before [[Robert\'s Rebellion]], and was a small boy hidden away at [[Casterly Rock]] when Rhaegar died at [[Battle of the Trident|the Trident]].\n\nTyrion learns from Aegon that the child murdered by [[Gregor Clegane]] during the [[Sack of King\'s Landing]] was a [[Pisswater prince|tanner\'s son]] from [[Pisswater Bend]] whom Varys purchased and substituted for Aegon in the cradle. After the Sack, Varys smuggled the baby Aegon across the [[narrow sea]] to [[Illyrio Mopatis]], who made the arrangements for Aegon\'s upbringing. Tyrion jokes that it will make a good story for the singers when he returns to Westeros, assuming [[Daenerys Targaryen]] takes him as her consort. Aegon is stunned by this, having clearly never considered the possibility that Daenerys might refuse him. Tyrion points out that she is a proud, strong, and fierce young woman who is unlikely to appreciate a relative coming to her with a begging bowl, certainly not one with a stronger claim to the [[Iron Throne]] than her own. Aegon angrily denies being a beggar, pointing out his own army, the [[Golden Company]]. Tyrion responds that Daenerys has a larger army than his own and owes nothing to Aegon. Aegon protests, trusting in Lord Connington to win her over. Tyrion calls him a fool, and gives him the following warning: \n\n{{Quote|Trust no one, my prince. Not your [[Haldon|chainless maester]], not your false father, not the gallant [[Rolly Duckfield|Duck]] or the lovely [[Lemore]] nor these other fine friends who grew you up from a bean. Above all, trust not the cheesemonger, nor the Spider, nor this little dragon queen you mean to marry. All this mistrust will sour your stomach and keep you awake at night, \xe2\x80\x99tis true, but better that than the long sleep that does not end.}}\n\nTyrion then suggests a different course of action to Aegon: head to Westeros instead of going east, land in [[Dorne]] and take advantage of all the problems caused by the [[War of the Five Kings]]. He points out that the [[North]] is in a chaotic condition, the [[riverlands]] are devastated, while [[Stannis Baratheon]] holds [[Storm\'s End]] and [[Dragonstone]]. The coming winter will starve out the realm. He then paints the opposition as particularly weak: King [[Tommen Baratheon]] is just a boy, and all his potential regents come with their own problems. [[Jaime Lannister]] actively avoids the responsibility of ruling, and [[Kevan Lannister]] is a born follower- he will only take the rule if it is offered to him. [[Mace Tyrell]] will have to fight the Lannisters to become regent, and Stannis\' unpopularity makes him an unlikely choice. That leaves only one potential candidate: [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]]. Tyrion is particularly scathing of his sister\'s ability to rule, comparing her to some of the worst Targaryen kings, noting that Cersei, in her paranoia and impatience, will undo all the alliances his father created to secure Tommen\'s hold on the Iron Throne and adds that if Aegon acts quickly, he can take advantage of the chaos and make serious gains before Cersei is overthrown and someone more competent takes her place.\n\nWhen Aegon protests, asking how they can win without his aunt and her [[dragon]]s, Tyrion points out that he doesn\'t have to conquer the Seven Kingdoms; he only needs to start winning victories, acting not as a beggar, but a true scion of [[House Targaryen]], like his ancestor [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]]. When he does, word of it will get back to Daenerys, and she and Aegon can meet as equals. Tyrion is convinced that Daenerys will fly to Aegon\'s side and immediately love him, as he is the last of her line, and she is above all a &quot;rescuer&quot;. \n\nTo re-emphasize his point to Aegon about trusting no one if he wants to survive in the game of thrones, Tyrion wins the cyvasse game using a piece of bad advice he gave and which the prince took at the start of the game. Aegon does not take his loss well; the sudden burst of anger convinces Tyrion the boy [[Targaryen madness|might be a Targaryen after all]].\n\nLater that evening,Haldon takes Tyrion into Selhorys in search of information, where they confirm the rumors that Daenerys still has not left Meereen. They need to know more, so Haldon takes Tyrion into an inn where they bribe a customs officer. [[Qavo Nogarys]], to learn more. They learn many things, such as the fact the rulers of [[Yunkai]] are spreading slanderous propaganda and offering heavy bribes to convince [[Volantis]] to side with them against Daenerys, whose attack on the slave trade has made her enemies in Volantis. By contrast, it is learned that the red priests of [[R\'hllor]], particularly the High Priest [[Benerro]] are supporting Daenerys, and preach Volantis\'s destruction if the city\'s rulers side against her, along with other apocalyptic prophecies. There are also rumors of Khal [[Pono]]\'s \'\'khalasar\'\' approaching the city, though they are confident they can, as usual, buy off the Dothraki.  \n\nLater, Tyrion convinces Haldon to let him find a brothel and goes searching for [[Tysha]]. He finds his way into a cheap brothel where he fucks a Westerosi looking girl, retches, fucks her again and then leaves ashamed of himself. On his way out, he stumbles drunkenly into a [[Jorah Mormont|Westerosi man]] who takes him  prisoner to be &quot;delivered to the queen&quot;.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 22]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Tyrion Lannister]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place on the Rhoyne]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Selhorys]]\n\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 22]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 23, Tyrion]]</text>\n      <sha1>gxcrfcbk9z6byyoyiiqxa31h106p1nq</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Clash of Kings-Chapter 42</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6214</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166445</id>\n      <parentid>139444</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-23T20:54:07Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4544">{{Infobox Chapter ACfK\n| pov\t\t= [[Davos Seaworth]]\n| place         = Outside the walls of [[Storm\'s End]]\n| title\t\t= Davos II\n| page\t\t= 442\n| previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 41|Tyrion IX]]\n| current\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 42|Davos II]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 43|Jon V]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 10|Davos I]] \n| arc next\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 58|Davos III]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Davos Seaworth|Davos]] has recently returned to [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]\'s fleet after delivering the king\xe2\x80\x99s message throughout the realm. He learns that Stannis has been having terrible nightmares, and that only Lady [[Melisandre]] can soothe him to sleep. She has been sharing his pavilion of late, and he wonders how she soothes him to sleep. \n\nSer [[Cortnay Penrose]] arrives to parley with Stannis, and scorns the king and all his new-found allies who were so recently sworn to [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]]. He especially mocks Lord [[Alester Florent]], for not only changing sides, but changing gods as well. \n\nSer Cortnay will not accept Stannis\xe2\x80\x99 demands, and will not surrender [[Storm\'s End]] nor [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]]\xe2\x80\x99s bastard [[Edric Storm]]. The Castellan throws his gauntlet in King Stannis\xe2\x80\x99 face, and proposes single combat to settle the issue. Stannis rejects him, stating he will take the castle by storm if he must, to which Ser Cortnay responds, &quot;Bring on your storm - and recall, if you do, the name of this castle.&quot; Stannis dismisses all his men save Davos, seeking the former smuggler\xe2\x80\x99s advice. Davos states his respect for Ser Cortnay, who kept his faith, unlike all these new lords in Stannis\xe2\x80\x99 army. Stannis dislikes them as much, but he needs their strength in order to win his throne.  Stannis sent Ser [[Parmen Crane]] to [[Bitterbridge]] to gather the rest of Renly\xe2\x80\x99s army, but there has been no word since. He tells Davos that he grieves for his brother Renly, and dreams of a green pavilion and the manner of Renly\xe2\x80\x99s death, even though he was in bed at the time of Renly\xe2\x80\x99s demise. Stannis says, &quot;\xe2\x80\xa6but I did love him, Davos. I know that now. I swear, I will go to my grave thinking of [[Peach (Renly\'s)|my brother\xe2\x80\x99s peach]].&quot;\n\n[[File:Shadow baby birth.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Melisandre]] gives birth to a [[shadow assassin|shadow]].&lt;br&gt;art by Anja]]\nDavos advises him to strike for [[King\'s Landing]] at once, but Stannis will not leave Storm\xe2\x80\x99s End untaken in his rear, for men will consider him defeated there. Stannis then tells Davos that he must have the boy [[Edric Storm]], as Melisandre has seen it in her flames; and she has also seen Ser Cortnay\xe2\x80\x99s death, as she saw Renly\xe2\x80\x99s at [[Dragonstone]]. The king commands Davos to bring Melisandre by boat under the cover of darkness beneath Storm\xe2\x80\x99s End, as he did some 15 years before. \n\nThat night, Davos is sickened by what he must do for his king. He asks Melisandre if she is good or evil, and she responds, &quot;Oh, good. I am a [[knight]] of sorts myself. A champion of light and life.&quot; Davos calls her a liar, for she means to kill a man this very night, as she killed [[Maester Cressen]] and Renly. The Red Woman responds that the maester poisoned himself, and that she had nothing to do with Renly\xe2\x80\x99s death. However, she later admits that Renly was unprotected, while the walls of Storm\xe2\x80\x99s End have spells woven into the stones, and that no shadow can pass from the outside. When Davos proclaims that a shadow is a thing of darkness, Melisandre rebuffs him, stating that shadows don\xe2\x80\x99t exist in the dark, they are servants of light and fire, provided by her god, [[R\'hllor]]. \n\nWhen they arrive at a gate in a water tunnel beneath the castle, Melisandre disrobes, and Davos watches in horror as the now pregnant woman gives birth to a shadow, and Davos recognizes the man who cast it.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n\n* The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n*Summary and analyses of the chapter [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2012/01/re-read-davos-ii-toddlers-in-dark.html in the course of a 10th reread].\n* [http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/05/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-20 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 42]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Davos Seaworth]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Storm\'s End]]\n\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 43, Davos]]</text>\n      <sha1>r2qrvfto2wb73gj4l6mqoj7g4nki4ms</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 63</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6936</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166606</id>\n      <parentid>131956</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-26T12:32:56Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2768">{{Infobox Chapter ADwD\n| pov\t\t= [[Victarion Greyjoy]]\n| place         = [[Slaver\'s Bay]]\n| title\t\t= Victarion I\n| page\t\t= 827\n| previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 62|The Sacrifice]]\n| current\t= Victarion I\n| next\t\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 64|The Ugly Little Girl]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 56|The Iron Suitor]]\n| arc next\t= \n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Victarion Greyjoy]] continues on his way to [[Meereen]].

Moqorro\'s prophecies are instrumental in the capture of these fleets. As a show of his appreciation, Victarion burns seven [[Lys|Lyseni]] bed slaves as a tribute to both the [[Drowned God]] and R\'hllor. After this sacrifice, a favourable wind rises for the Iron Fleet, which now numbers 60 ships with the new additions. \n\nThat night, Victarion allows Moqorro to inspect the [[Dragon Horn]] given to him by his brother [[Euron Greyjoy|Euron]].

We learn much about [[Barristan Selmy]], who gained the title \xe2\x80\x98the Bold\xe2\x80\x99 when he was just ten, riding as a [[mystery knight]] in a tourney at [[Blackhaven]], where he was unmasked by the [[Duncan Targaryen|Prince of Dragonflies]]. Barristan was knighted at sixteen by King [[Aegon V Targaryen|Aegon V]], and named to the Kingsguard in his 23rd year by [[Gerold Hightower]]. \n\nThe deeds and legends of Barristan the Bold are not lost on Jaime. He recalls the awesome fight between the [[Arthur Dayne|Sword of the Morning]] and the [[Smiling Knight]] of the [[Kingswood Brotherhood]], and thinks of his own childhood wishes: That boy had wanted to be Arthur Dayne, but someplace along the way he had become the Smiling Knight instead. \n\nJaime then receives the five Kingsguard currently under his command, and tests each of them. He mocks [[Boros Blount]] for his cowardice and inability to protect Prince [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], and tells him that from here on in, Blount will taste all the King\xe2\x80\x99s food. Blount storms from the room, and Jaime goes after [[Osmund Kettleblack]]. Disgusted that an upjumped [[sellsword]] with no reputation has been named to the Kingsguard, Jaime at least concedes that the man probably knows how to fight. \n\nHaving heard the details of the Kingsguard\'s willingness to beat [[Sansa Stark]] on Joffrey\'s orders, Jaime commands [[Meryn Trant]] to temper his obedience to the king while the king remains a boy, and to obey the [[Cersei Lannister|Queen Regent]], the [[Tywin Lannister|Hand]], and the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard instead. He gets [[Balon Swann]] to swear he will remain true to the Crown, even though his [[Gulian Swann|father]] and [[Donnel Swann|brother]]\xe2\x80\x99s allegiance are in question. \n\nLastly, he questions [[Loras Tyrell]], and finds the Knight of Flowers as cocky as he himself was in his youth. Jaime asks Loras about the supposed ghost of [[Renly Baratheon]] that fought at the [[Battle of the Blackwater]] at the van of his father\'s forces, obtaining an admission that it was [[Garlan Tyrell]] inside the armor.  Then he confronts Loras about [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]], and commands him to judge the woman fairly, on his honour as a knight. \n\nConsidering Jaime\xe2\x80\x99s words about [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]]\xe2\x80\x99s death, Ser Loras nearly breaks down, stating, &quot;\'\'When I saw him all bloody, with her fled ... if she\xe2\x80\x99s innocent, then [[Robar Royce|Robar]] and [[Emmon Cuy|Emmon]]\xe2\x80\xa6\'\'&quot; Jaime absolves him of killing the two [[Rainbow Guard]] in a rage, and then sits alone in the room, contemplating the other debts he still has to pay.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Jaime Lannister]]\n*[[Barristan Selmy]] Barristan the Bold\n*[[Duncan Targaryen]] Prince of Dragonflies\n*[[Aegon V Targaryen]]\n*[[Gerold Hightower]]\n*[[Arthur Dayne]] Sword of the Morning\n*[[Smiling Knight]]\n*[[Boros Blount]]\n*[[Tommen Baratheon]]\n*[[Osmund Kettleblack]]\n*[[Sansa Stark]]\n*[[Meryn Trant]]\n*[[Balon Swann]]\n*[[Gulian Swann]]\n*[[Donnel Swann]]\n*[[Loras Tyrell]] Knight of Flowers\n*[[Renly Baratheon]]\n*[[Garlan Tyrell]]\n*[[Brienne of Tarth]]\n*[[Robar Royce]]\n*[[Emmon Cuy]]\n}}\t\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[White Book]]\n*[[Kingsguard]]\n*[[Mystery knight]]\n*[[Blackhaven]]\n*[[Kingswood Brotherhood]]\n*[[Hedge knight]]\n*[[Battle of the Blackwater]]\n*[[Rainbow Guard]]\n}}\n\n\n==References and Notes==    \n* The synopsis was copied from AoL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].    \n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/08/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-41 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Part 41].

Ser [[Gregor Clegane]] kills a new-made knight named Ser [[Hugh]] in a joust, and after a victory Ser [[Loras Tyrell]] gives her a rose. During the feast that follows, Prince [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] is very courteous, but afterward he orders [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]] to escort Sansa back to her chambers. When the Hound notices Sansa is avoiding looking at his burned face, he forces her to look and tells her how he acquired it.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:Linda Tso Sansa Stark better than the songs.jpg|thumb|260px|left|\xe2\x80\x9cIt is better than the songs.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 by Linda Tso \xc2\xa9 Fantasy Flight Games]]\n\n[[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] rides to [[the Hand\'s tourney]] in a litter with [[Septa]] [[Mordane]] and [[Jeyne Poole]]. The splendor takes Sansa\xe2\x80\x99s breath away, the knights most of all. All of the [[Kingsguard]] are there in pure white cloaks and armor except Ser [[Jaime Lannister]], the Kingslayer, who wears his famous gilded armor. The gigantic Ser [[Gregor Clegane]] thunders past like an avalanche. Sansa also spies [[Yohn Royce]] and whispers to Jeyne that he wears bronze armor that is thousands of years old, engraved in runes that protect the wearer. Septa Mordane points out Lord [[Jason Mallister]] in an eagle-winged helmet and silver-chased indigo armor. The girls giggle at the warrior-priest [[Thoros of Myr]] until the septa tells them he [[Siege of Pyke|once]] scaled the walls of [[Pyke]] with a flaming sword. Although frightened by dark-skinned [[Jalabhar Xho]], when Jeyne sees Lord [[Beric Dondarrion]] she states she is willing to marry immediately. The procession carries on, with many knights whom Sansa does not know. To Sansa it is better than in the songs.\n\nThey watch the tourney from a place of honor. [[Jory Cassel]], in drab armor, wins two matches, but loses a well-fought third match to the freerider [[Lothor Brune]] when King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] judges Brune\xe2\x80\x99s lance to have been steadier and better placed. The other contestants from [[Winterfell]] do not fare as well. Sansa and Jeyne both scream sometimes when the riders crash together. Sansa notes that Jeyne often covers her eyes when a rider falls, but knows how a great lady must act, and draws the approval of Septa Mordane for her composure. \n\n[[File:Mark Evans tourney.jpg|thumb|280px|left|A Tourney Joust \xe2\x80\x93 by Mark Evans \xc2\xa9 Fantasy Flight Games]]\n\nThe jousting goes on all day and into the evening. Ser Jaime the Kingslayer rides brilliantly, defeating Ser [[Barristan Selmy]], who has already unhorsed two men thirty and forty years younger than himself. [[Sandor Clegane|The Hound]] and his immense brother Ser [[Gregor Clegane]], the Mountain-that-Rides, seem unstoppable. On Ser Gregor\xe2\x80\x99s second joust, his lance rides up and impales Ser [[Hugh|Hugh of the Vale]] in the neck, killing him. Ser Hugh, in his shiny new armor, falls not ten feet from Sansa. Jeyne is so disturbed that she cannot stop crying, forcing Septa Mordane to take her away to regain her composure, but she never returns. Sansa is astonished to find herself unmoved by the death, until she realizes there will be no songs sung of Ser Hugh. \n\nLord [[Renly Baratheon]], a crowd favorite, is unhorsed so violently by the Hound that he seems to fly backwards and the hard fall breaks a gold antler off his helm. Renly gives the broken antler to the Hound, who merely throws it into the crowd, which erupts in a riot until Lord Renly restores order. \n\n[[File:MKomarck KnightOfFlowers.jpg|thumb|270px|right|Loras Tyrell, the Knight of Flowers \xe2\x80\x93 by Michael Komarck \xc2\xa9 Fantasy Flight Games]]\n\nBy the end of the day\xe2\x80\x99s jousting, only four contestants remain: Ser Gregor Clegane, the Hound, Ser Jaime Lannister, and Ser [[Loras Tyrell]]. Sansa is entranced with Ser Loras, who is called the Knight of Flowers and has been giving white roses to various ladies in the crowd throughout the day. Finally, Ser Loras gives a red rose to Sansa, telling her, \xe2\x80\x9cNo victory is half so beautiful as you.\xe2\x80\x9d Sansa is mesmerized for a long while until she notices Lord [[Petyr Baelish]] above her. He tells Sansa that she has [[Catelyn Tully|her mother]]\xe2\x80\x99s hair, touches her cheek, and leaves. The king announces that the last three jousts will wait for the next day. \n\nLater, at the feast, Prince [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] sits next to Sansa. He has not spoken to her and she has not dared speak to him since the [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 15|fight]] on the [[kingsroad]]. Sansa remembers thinking at first that she hated Joffrey for [[Lady (direwolf)|Lady]]\xe2\x80\x99s death, but later she rationalized that it is not Joffrey but Queen [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] and [[Arya Stark|Arya]] that are responsible. Now Joffrey is the soul of courtesy, complimenting her by saying that Ser Loras has a keen eye for beauty. Sansa asks if Ser Loras will win, but Joffrey replies that either his uncle or his hound will defeat him, and that one day he will defeat them all. Joffrey fills her cup with wine, which makes her look at Septa Mordane, but when Joffrey fills the septa\xe2\x80\x99s cup also, Sansa thanks him. He talks to her the rest of the night, making her laugh and helping her eat new foods like snails and trout baked in clay. She can see that the arm [[Nymeria (direwolf)|Nymeria]] savaged is still bothering him, but he does not complain.\n\nThe king grows louder with each course. Finally, drunk as a man can be, he starts shouting at Queen Cersei, telling her, \xe2\x80\x9cNo! You do not tell me what to do, woman! I am king here, do you understand? I rule here, and if I say that I will fight tomorrow, I will fight!\xe2\x80\x9d Everyone stares, but no one interferes, and the queen storms off in silence. When Jaime comes to him, the king pushes him away hard, causing Jaime to fall. The king boasts that he can still knock Jaime in the dirt and that with his war hammer nobody can stand before him. Jaime replies stiffly, \xe2\x80\x9cAs you say, your grace.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nJoffrey then tells Sansa it grows late and asks if she needs an escort back. With Septa Mordane asleep at the table, Joffrey calls to the Hound to take his betrothed back to her quarters, and deserts Sansa. The Hound asks Sansa if she expected Joffrey to escort her back himself and scoffs at the idea. Sansa\xe2\x80\x99s dreamy night has suddenly vanished. She does not like the idea of the Hound taking her back to the apartments, but cannot wake Septa Mordane.\n\n[[File:MiguelRegod\xc3\xb3nHarkness theHound face.jpg|thumb|220px|left|The Hound - by Miguel Regod\xc3\xb3n Harkness \xc2\xa92012]]  \n\nAs the Hound escorts her back, Sansa cannot stand the sight of his burned face, despite insisting to herself that a true lady would not notice. She compliments the Hound\xe2\x80\x99s riding in the joust, giving him the knightly title \xe2\x80\x9cSer.\xe2\x80\x9d He responds angrily that he is no knight and that he spits on the vows knights take. He tells her that his brother is a knight, and asks if he fulfills her na\xc3\xafve expectations. Sansa, lost for words, can only reply that no one could withstand Ser Gregor. The Hound merely laughs that Sansa\xe2\x80\x99s septa has taught her well: she is just a pretty little bird reciting the words they taught her. When Sansa tells the Hound that he is frightening her, the scarred man only continues his story, insisting that during the tourney his brother noticed Ser Hugh\xe2\x80\x99s improperly fastened gorget and purposely let his lance ride up to kill Ser Hugh. \n\nThe Hound then forces Sansa to look at his burned face. When she starts to cry, the Hound tells her how his brother Gregor burned his face when he was six for stealing a toy knight. The toy had been nothing to Gregor, who was already a six-foot-tall squire. He had lifted Sandor bodily up and pressed his face into a brazier. Four years later they had anointed Gregor with the seven oils, and after his said his vows he was called \'\'Ser\'\' Gregor.\n\nSansa now feels sad for the Hound, and is no longer afraid of him. The silence goes on for a long while, and finally she touches the Hound and assures him that his brother is no true knight. They travel the rest of the way in silence. When he has finally delivered her to the corridor outside her bedchamber, Sansa thanks him. The Hound\xe2\x80\x99s only reply is a warning; keep the story about his face a secret or he will kill her.\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*Septa [[Mordane]]\n*Lord [[Yohn Royce]]\n*[[Thoros of Myr]]\n*Lord [[Beric Dondarrion]]\n*Lord [[Jason Mallister]]\n*[[Patrek Mallister]]\n*[[Harwin]]\n*[[Jory Cassel]]\n*[[Alyn]]\n*Ser [[Meryn Trant]]\n*Ser [[Aron Santagar]]\n| style=&quot;width:33%;&quot; |\n*[[Petyr Baelish]]\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n*[[Cersei Lannister]]\n*Ser [[Balon Swann]]\n*Lord [[Bryce Caron]]\n*Ser [[Andar Royce]]\n*Ser [[Robar Royce]]\n*Ser [[Horas Redwyne]]\n*Ser [[Hobber Redwyne]]\n*Ser [[Jared Frey]]\n*Ser [[Hosteen Frey]]\n*Ser [[Danwell Frey]]\n*Ser [[Emmon Frey]]\n| style=&quot;width:33%;&quot; |\n*Ser [[Theo Frey]]\n*Ser [[Perwyn Frey]]\n*[[Martyn Rivers]] \n*[[Jalabhar Xho]]\n*[[Lothor Brune]]\n*Ser [[Hugh]] of the Vale\n*Ser [[Loras Tyrell]]\n*[[Barristan Selmy]]\n*[[Moon Boy]]\n*[[Gregor Clegane]]\n*[[Sandor Clegane]]\n*[[Renly Baratheon]]\n|}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/07/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-15 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/030/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 29]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Sansa Stark|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 29]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in King\'s Landing]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 29]]\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 30, Sansa]]\n[[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\xa1\xd0\xb0\xd0\xbd\xd1\x81\xd0\xb0 II]]</text>\n      <sha1>tvjgpm4aah7zg4v2lycujrqu1azgupa</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Clash of Kings-Chapter 29</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6160</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>186390</id>\n      <parentid>178753</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-06-27T13:17:03Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Hops Splurt</username>\n        <id>6326</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <minor/>\n      <comment>/* Synopsis */ Typo: Shea -&gt; Shae</comment>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8350">{{Infobox Chapter ACfK\n| pov\t\t= [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n| place         = [[King\'s Landing]]\n| title\t\t= Tyrion VII\n| page\t\t= 326\n| previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 28|Bran IV]]\n| current\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 29|Tyrion VII]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 30|Arya VII]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 25|Tyrion VI]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 36|Tyrion VIII]]\n}}\n\nIt is late at night when [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] is disturbed by the arrival of [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]] with demands from [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] that [[Pycelle]] be released and Ser [[Jacelyn Bywater]] be arrested for defying a command in the [[Joffrey Baratheon|king\xe2\x80\x99s]] name. Lancel is arrogant until Tyrion reveals he knows his part in King [[Robert I Baratheon|Robert\xe2\x80\x99s]] death and that Lancel has been having sex with the queen. Tyrion threatens to tell Joffrey, and this convinces Lancel to agree to be Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s spy. Afterwards, Tyrion travels a circuitous route to be with [[Shae]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] is informed by a sleepy [[Podrick Payne]] that [[Lancel Lannister]] has arrived. Tyrion is not bothered by the late hour since he usually works well into the morning reading [[Varys]]\xe2\x80\x99 whisperers\' reports or going over [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger\xe2\x80\x99s]] accounts. He figures, however, that [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] was expecting Lancel\xe2\x80\x99s late arrival would catch him less alert. Tyrion takes his time, and roughens his hair to make it look like he has been woken from his sleep. \n\nTyrion warmly greets Lancel, who has been pacing. Lancel tells him that Cersei commands that [[Pycelle]] be released, handing Tyrion her warrant. Tyrion tells Lancel he hopes she is not overtaxing herself, he would not want to see a relapse. After being assured that she is recovered, Tyrion states it is music to his ears, thinking he should have given her a larger dose. Tryion offers Lancel mulled wine to help him sleep, and he rejects the offer, having not come to drink. Tyrion states that wine has its dangers and that he would have thought if Cersei was so concerned about Pycelle she would have come herself. Lancel tells Tyrion just to release the prisoner with a sneer, that the queen is [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey\xe2\x80\x99s]] regent. Tyrion replies that he is Joffrey\xe2\x80\x99s [[Hand of the King|Hand]]. Lancel replies \xe2\x80\x9cThe Hand serves. The regent rules until the king is of age,\xe2\x80\x9d and Tyrion says maybe he should write it down so he can remember, and tells Podrick to leave. \n\nAfter Pod leaves, Lancel states that Ser [[Jacelyn Bywater]] defied a command in the king\xe2\x80\x99s name, and that Cersei demands he be removed and charged with treason; Tyrion thinks that it means that Cersei has already ordered Pycelle\xe2\x80\x99s release and Bywater rebuffed her. When Lancel threatens Tyrion, Tyrion responds that he will hear no warning from a boy. Lancel touches his sword and warns Tyrion to watch his words. Tyrion in turn warns him that at a cry from him, [[Shagga]] will break in and kill Lancel with an axe and not a wineskin. Lancel, incensed, tells Tyrion that he is a knight. Tyrion asks if Cersei had him knighted before or after she took him to bed. Lancel says nothing, and Tyrion can tell from his eyes that Varys was right. When Tyrion comments, Lancel demands Tyrion withdraw his filthy accusations. Before he can finish, Tyrion mentions the result if Joffrey discovers he murdered his father to bed his mother. Lancel\'s courage deserts him as he insists to Tyrion that [[Tywin Lannister]] commanded Lancel to do everything that Cersei told him when he was assigned squire to King [[Robert I Baratheon]]. Tryion asks if Tywin told him to fuck Cersei also, noting that Lancel looks somewhat like [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]], but a poor copy. Lancel starts to say he only did has he was bid, to which Tyrion adds that he must have hated every instant of a high place in court, knighthood, and Cersei opening her legs, and then threatens to go to the king. Lancel begs for mercy as Tyrion continues his threats to go to the king, whom he is duty bound to inform. When Lancel states he will end it, Tyrion tells him no, that he will stay close to Cersei, be a spy for him, and tell no one. Lancel agrees, and Tyrion orders him to drink to their understanding. Tyrion then tells Lancel that he could do well out of this and that knighthood is nothing. Then he orders him to tell the queen that he begs her forgiveness, and he will let her have Pycelle to do with however she will, but he will not be on the council. With respect to Ser Jacelyn Bywater, Lancel is to assure the queen that he thinks he can win him away from Tyrion. Tyrion also notes he does not want another nephew. Lancel tells him that there is no need for concern since Cersei has him spill his seed on her belly.\n\nAfter he leaves, Tyrion thinks it fortunate that Lancel\'s father [[Kevan Lannister]] has two other sons, since in Tyrion\'s view, as Cersei will kill Lancel if she finds out he is betraying her, and even if Lancel survives the war, he will never survive Jaime\'s return to King\'s Landing, the only question being whether Jaime kills Lancel in a jealous rage or Cersei kills him to stop Jaime from finding out. Tyrion privately bets on Cersei.\n\nTyrion cannot get to sleep, so he sends Podrick, who was asleep, to summon [[Bronn]] and get two horses saddled. When Bronn arrives, he asks \xe2\x80\x9cWho pissed in your soup?\xe2\x80\x9d to which Tyrion answers Cersei. He states he should be used to the taste and that she seems to have mistaken him for [[Eddard Stark]]. Bronn replies that he was tall, to which Tyrion responds not after Joffrey took off his head.\n\nThey leave through the postern gate, then down Shadowblack Lane to the foot of [[Aegon\'s high hill]] onto Pigrun Alley. Tyrion reflects that the men that have been Hand have been no match for Cersei because they were too honest. The only way to defeat Cersei is to play her own game. In the crowded brothel, they are met by [[Chataya]], who leads them to the common room and serves them wine, apologizing for the quality; she cannot find good wine at any price, which Tyrion understands. As Tyrion waits, [[Dancy]] slides onto his lap, saying she has a cure for him feeling unloved. He tells her that he has grown fond of [[Alayaya]]\xe2\x80\x99s remedy. When Alayaya arrives, she leads him up the stairs, and tells him that Dancy has a bet with [[Marei]], and has only a fortnight before she loses her black pearls. She leads him to the Tower Room, telling him that she will sleep while he is gone before he disappears down the shaft to the tunnel.\n\nAs he leaves the stables on his gelding, he hears music that reminds him of the words [[Tysha]] sung to him, who was a lie, a whore Jaime had hired to make him a man.\n\nHe arrives at the manse which has been arranged by Varys as a place to sequester [[Shae]]. He told Varys he wanted her protected by ugly, scared men who did not like having sex with women. She is now protected by a [[Braavos]]i [[Braavosi daggerman|daggerman]] with a hare lip and a lazy eye, one [[eunuch strangler]], and a pair of foul smelling [[Ibben]]ese who are fond of axes and each other. If Tyrion had her guarded by his [[Vale mountain clans|clansmen]], it would only be a matter of time before everyone knew of his concubine.\n\nHe enters the room not intending to disturb Shae, but the sight of her nude body makes him hard. He spreads her legs and starts to lick her until his beard is soaked and then enters her, and explodes almost at once. She opens her eyes and tells him she just had the sweetest dream.\n\nTyrion thinks of the wars and intrigues and that he was made for this.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://slynt.blogspot.com/2011/11/re-read-tyrion-vii-song-of-brother-and.html Analyses and summary of the chapter in the course of a 10th reread] by Slynt. \n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/04/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-14 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n\n[[Category:A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 29]]\n[[Category:A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Tyrion Lannister]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in King\'s Landing]]\n\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 29]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 30, Tyrion]]</text>\n      <sha1>iowqomzrhp4ho9qm73n7i9inmh8ln0v</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 45</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5650</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>175372</id>\n      <parentid>166037</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-10-25T15:47:59Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6341">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Catelyn Tully|Catelyn]]\n| title\t\t= Catelyn V\n| place         = [[Whispering Wood]] - [[Oldstones]] - [[Hag\'s Mire]]\n| page\t\t= 514\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 44|Jaime VI]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 45|Catelyn V]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 46|Samwell III]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 35|Catelyn IV]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 49|Catelyn VI]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==   \nTraveling in the rain to [[the Twins]], [[Catelyn Tully|Catelyn]] recalls [[Robb Stark|Robb]] sending Ser [[Rolph Spicer]] to deliver [[Martyn Lannister]] to the [[Golden Tooth]] in an exchange of captives. We also learn that [[Robett Glover]] has been put on a ship at [[Duskendale]] as part of the agreement. Robb left [[Jeyne Westerling|his wife]] at [[Riverrun]], and only Ser [[Raynald Westerling]] travels with them. Robb has brought 3,500 men with him, those who have been with him since the [[Battle of the Whispering Wood]], and who will follow him to [[Moat Cailin]] after the wedding. While passing through [[Whispering Wood|the site of the battle]], Catelyn thinks of [[Theon Greyjoy]] boasting he had almost crossed swords with Ser [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] and how much ill would have been undone if Theon had died in place of [[Rickard Karstark|Lord Karstark]]\xe2\x80\x99s sons.\n\n[[File:Here Lies Tristifer.png|350px|thumb|left|[[Catelyn Tully]] and [[Robb Stark]] come upon King [[Tristifer IV]]\'s tomb.&lt;br&gt;Art by onionjulius]]\nWhen they reach [[Oldstones]], Cat recalls that the ruins were once a great castle of the [[King of the Rivers and the Hills|River Kings]] during the [[House Mudd|Mudd Dynasty]]. The Mudds were [[First Men]], but during the time of King [[Tristifer IV Mudd|Tristifer IV]], the kingdoms of the First Men were falling before the onslaught of the [[Andals]]. Tristifer IV died when seven Andal kings joined forces against him. \n\nRobb tells his mother that he plans to legitimize his brother [[Jon Snow|Jon]] and name him heir should he and Jeyne not have a child. Catelyn is stunned by this proclamation, and pleads with him not to make the mistake the [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]] made when King [[Aegon IV Targaryen]] legitimized all his bastards on his deathbed. The [[House Blackfyre|Blackfyre Pretenders]] plagued the Targaryens for five generations until Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] slew [[Maelys Blackfyre]] on the [[Stepstones]]. They both fear that [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] will give [[Tyrion Lannister|the Imp]] a son and thus control of [[Winterfell]] and agree that must be prevented. She pleads that Robb consider naming his sister [[Arya Stark|Arya]] as heir, but Robb insists that no one has seen Arya since [[Eddard Stark|his father\'s]] death and that his sister is likely also dead. Catelyn tells Robb that she cannot support his choice of Jon but Robb reminds her that he doesn\'t have to ask for her support, stating his reason as, &quot;I\'m the King.&quot;\n \n[[Jason Mallister]] soon joins Robb\xe2\x80\x99s force at [[Hag\'s Mire]], bringing with him the captain of the \'\'[[Myraham]]\'\'. The man tells them that [[Balon Greyjoy]] fell to his death when a wind blew him off one of the bridges between the towers of [[Pyke]], and no sooner was he dead than [[Euron Greyjoy|Euron Crow\xe2\x80\x99s Eye]] returned and claimed the [[Seastone Chair]], naming himself King of the Iron Islands and the North. Knowing [[Victarion Greyjoy|Victarion]] and [[Asha Greyjoy|Asha]] will not stand still for this, Robb commands [[Maege Mormont]] and [[Galbart Glover]] to take men by longship and sail through the marshes of [[the Neck]] to seek out [[Howland Reed]]. Robb plans to march on Moat Cailin with 12,000 men once he joins with [[Roose Bolton]]. The [[crannogmen]] will guide a small force under Robb\xe2\x80\x99s command across the swamps in order to reach Moat Cailin from the north. When Galbart warns him what should happen if the crannogmen were to fail him, Robb replies, &quot;They will not fail. My father knew the worth of Howland Reed.&quot; Robb then announces that Catelyn will be taken to [[Seagard]] under the protection of Lord Jason after the wedding. He then calls his bannermen to fix their seals as witnesses to the decree naming his heir.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Catelyn Tully]]\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Rolph Spicer]]\n*[[Martyn Lannister]]\n*[[Robett Glover]]\n*[[Jeyne Westerling]]\n*[[Raynald Westerling]]\n*[[Theon Greyjoy]]\n*[[Jaime Lannister]]\n*[[Rickard Karstark]]\n*[[Tristifer IV Mudd]]\n*[[Jon Snow]]\n*[[Aegon IV Targaryen]]\n*[[Barristan Selmy]]\n*[[Maelys I Blackfyre]]\n*[[Sansa Stark]]\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]] The Imp\n*[[Arya Stark]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n*[[Jason Mallister]]\n*[[Balon Greyjoy]]\n*[[Euron Greyjoy]]\n*[[Victarion Greyjoy]]\n*[[Asha Greyjoy]]\n*[[Maege Mormont]]\n*[[Galbart Glover]] \n*[[Howland Reed]]\n*[[Roose Bolton]]\n}}\t\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[The Twins]]\n*[[Golden Tooth]]\n*[[Duskendale]]\n*[[Riverrun]]\n*[[Whispering Wood]]\n*[[Moat Cailin]]\n*[[Oldstones]]\n*[[King of the Rivers and the Hills]]\n*[[House Mudd]]\n*[[First Men]]\n*[[Andals]]\n*[[House Targaryen]]\n*[[House Blackfyre]]\n*[[Stepstones]]\n*[[Winterfell]]\n*[[Myraham]]\n*[[Pyke]]\n*[[Seastone Chair]]\n*[[the Neck]]\n*[[Crannogmen]]\n*[[Seagard]]\n}}\n\n\n==References and Notes==\n* The synopsis was copied from AoL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/04/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-26 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Part 26].

As they ride up the godsway, [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] discusses the pros and cons of Dothraki combat skills with Ser [[Jorah Mormont]]. Once they have settled in, Daenerys invites [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]] to sup with her and makes a peace offering of new clothes. He becomes angry and grabs her. She hits him hard with a belt and tells him to leave.\n\n==Synopsis==    \n[[File:Tomasz Jedruszek Vaes Dothrak.jpg|thumb|240px|left|The Horse Gate of Vaes Dothrak \xe2\x80\x94 Tomasz Jedruszek \xc2\xa9 FFG]]\n\t\nThe \'\'[[khalasar]]\'\' enters [[Vaes Dothrak]] under the [[Mother of Mountains]] and proceeds along the godsway, passing under the gigantic Horse Gate, a pair of rearing bronze stallions whose hooves meet a hundred feet up. [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] wonders why Vaes Dothrak needs a gate when it appears to have no walls, no buildings, and no people. All that Daenerys can see are ancient monuments that the [[Dothraki]] have sacked over the centuries in the grass on either side of the godsway. \n\nAs she looks back at her brother [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]], who is now mounted again, Daenerys thinks back on the events of the long ride east. After the [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 23|incident]] on the [[Dothraki Sea]], Viserys had been forced to walk and the Dothraki had named him \'\'Khal Rhae Mhar\'\', the \xe2\x80\x9cSore Foot King.\xe2\x80\x9d Viserys did not realize that he was being mocked when he accepted a ride in a cart from [[Khal]] [[Drogo]], which earned him another name, \'\'Khal Rhaggat\'\', the \xe2\x80\x9cCart King.\xe2\x80\x9d Daenerys had begged Ser [[Jorah Mormont|Jorah]] not to tell Viserys the truth, and only after much pleading had she convinced Drogo to allow Viserys to ride again. \n\nNow, as they ride past the broke idols of fallen cities, Viserys tells Daenerys that all the Dothraki savages can do is steal things better men have built and kill, which is all he needs them for. He goes on to say the Dothraki cannot speak the language of civilized men, and then states that he is tired of waiting for Drogo to give him his army. Ser Jorah tells Viserys that Drogo will honor his promise in his own time. Fortunately, few of the Dothraki can understand the Common Tongue. After Viserys leaves, Ser Jorah explains that the Dothraki are not merchants and do not trade; despite what Viserys thinks, Khal Drogo considers Daenerys a gift and will eventually give a gift in return.\n\nDaenerys points out that it is not right to make her brother wait, and says Viserys believes he can sweep the [[Seven Kingdoms]] with 10,000 Dothraki. Ser Jorah snorts that Viserys could not sweep a stable with 10,000 brooms. Daenerys asks whether it would be possible for someone stronger than Viserys. Ser Jorah tells her that when he first came to [[Essos]] he saw the Dothraki as half-naked barbarians and believed that a thousand good knights could put a hundred times as many Dothraki to flight. Now he is not so sure; the Dothraki are better riders, their bows (wielded from horseback) have a longer range, and there are so many of them. Drogo alone commands 40,000 men, the same number that [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]] brought to the [[Battle of the Trident]], and only a tenth of Rhaegar\'s men were knights. When Rhaegar died, many fled the field and such a rabble would not last long against 40,000 Dothraki. However, the Dothraki have no patience for siegecraft and if the armies of [[Westeros]] stayed behind their castle walls they could hold out forever. [[Robert Baratheon]] might be fool enough to give them battle, but the men around him are not: [[Stannis Baratheon]], [[Tywin Lannister]], and [[Eddard Stark]]. The way he says the last name leads Daenerys to ask if Ser Jorah hates the man. Ser Jorah replies that Eddard Stark took everything he loved from him for a few lice-ridden poachers and his precious honor.\n\nThey arrive at the city, which is both the largest and the smallest Daenerys has ever seen; it sprawls ancient, arrogant, and empty across the plain. The buildings are all different. Ser Jorah explains that they are built by slaves in the fashion they were familiar with. He also explains that the only permanent residents are the \'\'[[dosh khaleen]]\'\', the widows of all the \'\'khals\'\' who have come before, yet Vaes Dothrak is large enough to house all the \'\'khalasars\'\' if they should all return at once, as is prophesized.\n\nWhen they near the eastern market and dismount, each rider gives up all his weapons to a waiting slave, for in Vaes Dothrak no man may carry steel or spill blood. The palace of Khal Drogo is a massive feasting hall of roughhewn logs that make a wall 40 feet tall with a roof of silk surrounded by horse yards and hundreds of earthen houses.\n\nDaenerys is met by [[Cohollo]], one of Khal Drogo\xe2\x80\x99s [[bloodrider]]s, who informs her that Drogo must ascend the Mother of Mountains that night to sacrifice for his safe return. As she speaks to Cohollo, Daenerys recalls that the \'\'khal\xe2\x80\x99s\'\' three bloodriders are his sworn brothers who share everything with him except his horses. Daenerys is glad that Drogo does not hold to the tradition of sharing \'\'her\'\' with his bloodriders because some of them frighten her. Bloodriders are bound to their \'\'khal\'\' for life and die when he dies, living only long enough to avenge him if required. Daenerys finds herself wishing [[Aerys II Targaryen|her father]] was guarded by such men, remembering the stories of [[Jaime Lannister|the Kingslayer]] who murdered her father and Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] who went over to [[Robert Baratheon|the Usurper]].\n\nDaenerys, who is tiring easily as her child grows, is looking forward to a night of rest. She is led to one of the hollow hills that has been prepared for her. She decides to give her brother his gifts tonight. She has prepared Viserys several sets of clothes that she hopes will help him earn the respect of the Dothraki. She also intends the gifts as a way of apologizing for shaming him. Daenerys orders [[Doreah]] to invite him to supper and [[Irri]] to go to the market to buy something other than horse meat, which Viserys hates.\n\nViserys soon arrives, dragging Doreah by the arm, furious that Daenerys would presume to give him commands. Daenerys attempts to explain that Doreah misspoke, then shows Viserys the clothes she has had made for him. Viserys only sneers at the clothes, calling them Dothraki rags. Her brother goes on to ridicule her for presuming to dress him and suggests spitefully that next Daenerys will want to braid his hair. Daenerys declares that he has no right to a braid because he has won no victories. \n\nViserys grabs her by the arm, hurting her, and for a moment Daenerys is a scared little girl again. Then she grabs hold of the first thing she touches, a medallion belt she meant to give Viserys, and swings it with all her strength. The belt hits her brother full in the face and leaves a deep cut. Daenerys tells Viserys to leave and pray that Drogo does not hear of this. Viserys leaves in a fury, telling her that when he comes into his [[Seven Kingdoms|kingdom]] she will regret this day.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/07/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-18 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/037/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==      \n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 36]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Daenerys Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Vaes Dothrak]]\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 36]]\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 37, Daenerys]]\n[[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\x94\xd1\x8d\xd0\xb9\xd0\xbd\xd0\xb5\xd1\x80\xd0\xb8\xd1\x81 IV]]</text>\n      <sha1>5ydytvct0yzcfsxyogjnee5g5r70wmd</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Game of Thrones-Chapter 12</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>3438</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>165955</id>\n      <parentid>159619</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-17T14:10:34Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7913">{{Infobox Chapter AGoT\n| pov\t\t= [[Eddard Stark]]\n| place         = [[Barrowlands]]\n| title\t\t= Eddard II\n| page\t\t= \n| previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 11|Daenerys II]]\n| current\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 12|Eddard II]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 13|Tyrion II]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 4|Eddard I]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 16|Eddard III]]\n}} __NOTOC__\n\n[[Eddard Stark|Ned]] and King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] discuss the threat posed by [[Daenerys Targaryen]]\'s marriage and the events surrounding the [[Sack of King\'s Landing]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File: Pojypojy_nedandRobert.jpg\xe2\x80\x8e|&quot;I swear to you, I was never so alive as when I was winning this throne, or so dead as now that I\'ve won it&quot; - by Pojypojy \xc2\xa9|thumb|300px|left]]\n[[Eddard Stark|Ned]] is woken before dawn to find his horse saddled and King [[Robert I Baratheon|Robert]] waiting. When the king claims to have urgent matters of state to discuss, Ned invites him to come inside. Robert refuses, claiming that the camp is full of ears, so Ned dresses and mounts up.\n\nRobert sets a hard pace and soon the pair leave the [[kingsroad]] to ride through the [[barrowlands]]. They do not stop until dawn, miles south of the main party. Exhilarated by the ride, Robert complains of the glacial pace of [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]]\xe2\x80\x99s wheelhouse and jokingly suggests that he and Ned run off to live as vagabond knights. Ned laughs and reminds Robert of their duties and that they are no longer the boys they once were. Robert jokes that Ned never was the boy he once was, then tries to recall the name of the woman Ned fathered [[Jon Snow]] with. Ned provides the name [[Wylla]], but coldly refuses to say more about her.\n\nRobert finally gets to the business at hand: a message from the eunuch [[Varys]], his master of whisperers in [[King\'s Landing]]. Ned reads the message with some trepidation, thinking of [[Lysa Arryn]] and her terrible accusation, but finds that it concerns the [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 11|wedding]] of [[Daenerys Targaryen]] to [[Khal]] [[Drogo]]. When Robert explains that the information has come from Ser [[Jorah Mormont]], Ned takes offense, recalling Mormont as a fugitive who fled the King\xe2\x80\x99s justice after selling some poachers to a [[Tyrosh|Tyroshi]] slaver in defiance of the law.\n\nThe news of the wedding does not worry Ned, but when Robert angrily suggests an assassination attempt he is not surprised. Since the days of the [[Robert\'s Rebellion|rebellion]], Robert has held a hatred for the [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]] that seems a madness to Ned. Ned recalls the angry words that passed between Robert and himself when [[Tywin Lannister]] presented Robert with the corpses of [[Rhaegar Targaryen]]\xe2\x80\x99s wife [[Elia Martell|Elia]] and children [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaegar)|Aegon]] and [[Rhaenys Targaryen (daughter of Rhaegar)|Rhaenys]] as tokens of fealty. Ned called it murder but Robert called it war. It took the death of [[Lyanna Stark|Lyanna]] to reconcile them again.\n\nThis time Ned keeps his temper, telling Robert that he is no Tywin Lannister to slaughter innocents. Robert angrily insists that Daenerys will not remain an innocent forever and will soon breed more \xe2\x80\x9cdragonspawn\xe2\x80\x9d to plague him. When Ned reiterates that killing a child would be unspeakable, Robert responds that what [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys]] did to Ned\xe2\x80\x99s [[Rickard Stark|father]] and [[Brandon Stark|brother]] and what Rhaegar did to Lyanna were unspeakable.\n\nWhen Robert mentions that Drogo has 100,000 men in his [[khalasar|horde]], Ned insists that even a million [[Dothraki]] are no threat to the realm without ships. Robert replies that ships can be found in the [[Free Cities]] and that many in the [[Seven Kingdoms]]\xe2\x80\x94particularly in [[Dorne]] and [[the Reach]]\xe2\x80\x94would not hesitate to join a Targaryen invasion. Despite this, Ned remains convinced that they would be able to drive the Dothraki back, emphasizing the importance of appointing a new [[Warden of the East]]. When Robert refuses to appoint [[Jon Arryn]]\xe2\x80\x99s son [[Robert Arryn|Robert]], Ned suggests the king\xe2\x80\x99s own brother, [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]. When Robert continues to be evasive, Ned quickly deduces that he has already promised the office to [[Jaime Lannister]]. Ned reminds Robert that Jaime already stands to succeed Tywin Lannister as [[Warden of the West]] and that as Warden of both East and West, Jaime would control half of all the realm\xe2\x80\x99s armies.\n\nNed asks whether Jaime can be trusted. When Robert asks why he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t trust Jaime, Ned reminds him that Jaime betrayed and killed the last king he was sworn to protect. To illustrate his point about Jaime Lannister, Ned describes to Robert how, after the [[Battle of the Trident]], he followed Rhaegar\'s army back to King\'s Landing to find the city [[Sack of King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing|sacked]] by the Lannisters. Ned goes on to explain that upon entering the throne room, he found King Aerys dead on the floor and Jaime sitting on the [[Iron Throne]]. Although Jaime eventually rose to say that he was only keeping the uncomfortable thing warm for Robert, Ned insists that Jaime had no right to sit the throne.\n\nRobert finds this amusing and does not consider Jaime\'s &quot;great sin&quot; to be that bad. He gallops off but Ned pauses, despairing of ever keeping Robert from making mistakes. He still believes he should be in Winterfell with his wife and [[Bran Stark|Bran]]. Finally, resigned to not being able to be where he belongs, Ned follows his king.\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Alyn]]\n*[[Boros Blount]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n*[[Meryn Trant]]\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Aerys II Targaryen]]\n*[[Baelor I Targaryen]]\n*[[Becca]]\n*[[Brandon Stark]]\n*[[Bran Stark]]\n*[[Catelyn Tully]]\n*[[Cersei Lannister]]\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n*[[Drogo]]\n*[[Jaime Lannister]]\n*[[Jon Arryn]]\n*[[Jorah Mormont]]\n*[[Lyanna Stark]]\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Lysa Tully]]\n*[[Rhaegar Targaryen]]\n*[[Robert Arryn]]\n*[[Stannis Baratheon]]\n*[[Tywin Lannister]]\n*[[Varys]]\n*[[Wylla]]\n|}\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:20%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[Bear Island]]\n*[[Casterly Rock]]\n*[[Free Cities]]\n*[[King\'s Landing]]\n*[[Kingsroad]]\n*[[Pentos]]\n| style=&quot;width:20%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[Red Keep]]\n*[[Seven Kingdoms]]\n*[[Storm\'s End]]\n*[[Trident]]\n*[[Tyrosh]]\n*[[Winterfell]]\n| style=&quot;width:20%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[House Arryn]]\n*[[Bannerman]]\n*[[Dothraki]]\n*[[Dragon]]\n*[[First Men]]\n*[[Hand of the King]]\n*[[Ice]]\n| style=&quot;width:20%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[Iron Throne]]\n*[[Khal]]\n*[[Kingsguard]]\n*[[House Lannister]]\n*[[House Mormont]]\n*[[Others]]\n*[[House Stark]]\n| style=&quot;width:20%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[Sworn Brother]]\n*[[House Targaryen]]\n*[[House Trant]]\n*[[House Tully]]\n*[[Usurper]]\n*[[Warden of the East]]\n*[[Warden of the West]]\n|}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2009/05/eddard-tyrion.html Humorous review of the chapter]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/05/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-7 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/013/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{EnWikia|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 12|small=yes}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 12]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Eddard Stark|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 12]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in the North]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place along the Kingsroad]]\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 12]]\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 13, Eddard]][[pt:A Guerra dos Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 12]][[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\xad\xd0\xb4\xd0\xb4\xd0\xb0\xd1\x80\xd0\xb4 II]]</text>\n      <sha1>ffysz4qjwlnktprdwpp9i5xtdwspyzx</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 53</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5811</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>167514</id>\n      <parentid>159642</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-06-29T09:44:13Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Frernok</username>\n        <id>5007</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <comment>/*References and Notes*/</comment>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20141">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]]\n| title\t\t= Tyrion VI\n| place         = [[King\'s Landing]]\n| page\t\t= 584\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 52|Arya XI]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 53|Tyrion VI]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 54|Davos V]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 38|Tyrion V]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 58|Tyrion VII]]\n}}\n[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] receives the news that [[Robb Stark|Robb]] and [[Catelyn Tully|Catelyn Stark]] are dead. The end of the [[War of the Five Kings|war]] is within reach and [[Tywin Lannister|Lord Tywin]] intends to be generous to [[House Stark|Stark]] allies, but Joffrey wants all traitors executed and accuses his grandfather of cowardice during [[Robert\'s Rebellion]]. Tywin orders Joffrey to be escorted to his bedchamber, and Cersei leaves after an unsuccessful attempt to defend him. On the Dornish issue, Tywin reveals that he will not sacrifice [[Gregor Clegane]] to the [[House Martell|Martells]]. Tyrion is shocked, and Tywin explains his rationale at the time of the [[Sack of King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing]] and the murder of [[Elia Martell]] and her children. He also reveals that [[Arya Stark]] is still alive.\n==Synopsis==\n[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] and [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] spend a joyless meal together, with both not talking much. Sansa takes a joke Tyrion makes about the quality of the food as him criticizing her, but he assures her that it\'s not her fault and that he has more serious matters to worry about. Besides [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] and [[Tywin Lannister|his father]], what bothers him most are the 300 Dornishmen visiting for the King\'s wedding. He has settled them in a cornerfort of the [[Red Keep]], as far away from the [[House Tyrell|Tyrells]] as possible, yet there has already been a brawl between Tyrell and [[House Gargalen|Gargalen]] soldiers at [[Flea Bottom]], leaving one dead, and a confrontation in the yard where [[Olenna Redwyne]] called [[Ellaria Sand]] &quot;the serpent\'s whore&quot;, while [[Oberyn Martell]] keeps asking for justice concerning the death of his sister [[Elia Martell|Elia]] and her children every time he sees Tyrion. However, Tyrion sees no point in bothering his already troubled young wife with any of this. After the meal, Sansa asks for leave for her nightly visit to the [[godswood]]. Although Tyrion finds Sansa\'s piety excessive, he allows it, even offering to accompany her some time. She immediately objects to this, telling him he would be bored, as praying to the [[old gods]] is mainly done in silence and without adornments. She knows him better than he imagined, he thinks. He is tempted to ask what she prays for, but is afraid of what the answer would be.\n\nHe gets back to his tedious tasks as [[Master of Coin]], trying to make sense of some of the complicated numbers in the ledgers [[Petyr Baelish]] left him. He considers some of Littlefinger\'s investments highly suspicious. Tyrion now regrets that he consented so easily to the execution of the [[Antler Men]], as he has since learned that some of them owed the Crown large sums and suspects that having [[Bronn]] try locating their heirs will be a futile effort. Ser [[Boros Blount]] arrives, delivering a summons from Lord Tywin. Tyrion is glad to leave the books. Outside, rain is in the air, making Tyrion concerned Sansa will get soaked at the godswood.\n\nWhen he arrives at the [[Tower of the Hand|Hand\xe2\x80\x99s solar]], he finds King Joffrey, Queen Regent Cersei, Ser [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]] and Grand Maester [[Pycelle]] there as well, besides his father. Joffrey is obviously elated, Cersei smiles smugly, yet Lord Tywin is his usual grim self and Tyrion wonders whether his father can smile at all. Tyrion asks what has happened and is shown a roll of parchment. The message reads: &quot;[[Roslin Frey|Roslin]] caught a fine fat trout. Her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding.&quot; Checking the seal, Tyrion realizes that the message comes from [[The Twins]]. He asks whether Lord [[Walder Frey]] thinks he is being poetic. He realizes that &quot;trout&quot; refers to [[Edmure Tully]], but before he can speculate on the meaning of the &quot;pair of wolf pelts&quot;, Joffrey announces that the message implies that [[Robb Stark]] is dead.\n\nTyrion\'s thoughts immediately drift to his wife, probably praying this very moment to her [[Eddard Stark|father\'s]] gods, for her brother\'s victory and her [[Catelyn Tully|mother\'s]] safety. It seems that neither the Old nor the [[Faith of the Seven|New Gods]] are listening to prayer, Tyrion thinks, wondering whether this should give him some comfort. He makes a glib comment about the kings falling like leaves this autumn and their little war winning itself, prompting a poisonly sweet reply by Cersei that it\'s in fact Lord Tywin who won the war. Lord Tywin doesn\'t consider the war over as long as enemies are in the field, yet Cersei is optimistic that the lords of the [[Riverlands]], confronted with the combined powers of [[Highgarden]], [[Casterly Rock]] and [[Dorne]] without the northmen to support them, will choose submission over destruction now. Lord Tywin agrees that most will, except for [[Riverrun]] and probably [[Seagard]] and [[Raventree Hall]]. However, [[Brynden Tully]] won\'t dare to become a threat as long as Lord Frey keeps his nephew Edmure as hostage, and the [[House Frey|Freys]] can keep [[Jason Mallister]] penned up at his seat while [[Jonos Bracken]] might be bribed to change allegiance and attack the [[House Blackwood|Blackwoods]]. In the end, everyone will bend their knees, Tywin predicts, and he is ready to offer generous terms. He is going to spare every castle except one. Tyrion assumes that the exception will be [[Harrenhal]], which Lord Tywin confirms, announcing that he has already commanded Ser [[Gregor Clegane]] to attack the castle and rid the realm of the [[Brave Companions]]. Tyrion is amused about his father exploiting the Mountain before he will be handed over to the [[House Martell|Martells]], yet the prospect of Littlefinger soon being able to take his seat at Harrenhal doesn\'t please him. He wonders whether Lord Baelish has already arrived at the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]], wishing his ship sank instead.\n\nKing Joffrey doesn\'t agree with generous terms, insisting that all traitors should be executed instead. He wants Lord Walder to send him Robb Stark\'s head, so that he can serve it to Sansa at his wedding feast. Ser Kevan is shocked and reminds him that Sansa is now his aunt by marriage. Cersei tries to dismiss his statement, calling it a jest, yet Joffrey insists. Tyrion angrily tells Joffrey that he can\'t torture Sansa any longer, calling him a monster, to which Joffrey replies that Tyrion is the true monster. Tyrion counters that Joffrey should be concerned then, as monsters are dangerous and kings are dying like flies already. Joffrey and Cersei are furious about Tyrion\'s threat, but Lord Tywin scolds Joffrey instead, advising him that a king who feels the need to remind people of his power is no true king. [[Aerys II Targaryen|King Aerys]] never understood that, Lord Tywin says, as proven by his habit of having the tongues of people like Ser [[Ilyn Payne]] ripped out, but Joffrey will. It\'s necessary to fight your enemies, but if they yield, generosity is the right approach. Lord Tywin closes by telling Joffrey that the only head he should be concerned with right now is [[Margaery Tyrell]]\'s maidenhead.\n\nJoffrey is sullen, then surprises everyone in the room by defying Lord Tywin, accusing him of having been afraid of King Aerys. Tyrion thinks that things just got interesting. Cersei demands that Joffrey apologize to his grandfather, yet he goes on, recounting how it was [[Robert Baratheon]] who fought [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Prince Rhaegar]] and won the crown while Lord Tywin hid at Casterly Rock. A strong king acts boldly, he states. Lord Tywin is not amused, thanking the King coldly for sharing his wisdom. He asks Ser Kevan to escort Joffrey to his bedchamber and Pycelle to give him some dreamwine, completely ignoring Joffrey\'s protest. As Ser Kevan firmly guides Joffrey out and Pycelle follows, Tyrion and Cersei remain, on their father\'s order. Cersei tries to apologize for Joffrey\'s behavior, calling him willful. Lord Tywin thinks Joffrey is more stupid than willful and asks who put the idea into the boy\'s head that strong kings act boldly. Cersei suggests it was Robert. Tyrion, glad to bring up that comment again, confirms that the part about Tywin hiding in Casterly Rock sounded like something Robert would say. Cersei tries to play into this, but Lord Tywin is upset that he might have fought a war to seat &quot;Robert the Second&quot; on the [[Iron Throne]] when Cersei has been assuring him that the boy cared nothing for his father. He doesn\'t, Cersei insists, recounting how Robert cared nothing for his son, would have beaten the boy if he could and hit him so hard once that Joffrey lost two teeth, causing her to threaten Robert to kill him if he hit him again. Lord Tywin tells his daughter to leave, which she does seethingly. Tyrion proposes that, rather than following his father\'s footsteps, Joffrey will become &quot;[[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys]] the Third&quot;. Lord Tywin responds that he is only thirteen and still has time to grow, yet Tyrion notices that his father is more upset than he  wants to show. Lord Tywin announces that Joffrey needs a hard lesson, reminding Tyrion of the [[Tysha|hard lesson his father gave him when he was the same age]], which almost makes him feel sorry for Joffrey. However, Tyrion can\'t think of anyone who\'d deserve it more than Joffrey.\n\nTyrion gets back to the business of war. He congratulates his father, asking him how long he had been plotting with Lord Walder. Lord Tywin objects to his son\'s choice of words. Tyrion retorts that he doesn\'t enjoy being left in the dark. His father explains that nobody was told who didn\'t play a part in the execution, including Cersei, stressing how important it is to keep secrets, especially in [[King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing]]. He wanted to get rid of a dangerous enemy as cheaply as possible and that has been achieved, he announces, also suggesting that, while Tyrion has some talent for cunning, he simply talks too much and his loose tongue will be his undoing one day. Tyrion jests that he should have let Joffrey rip his tongue out then and Lord Tywin says he shouldn\'t tempt him.\n\nThe discussion moves on to the Dornish issue. Lord Tywin considers the presence of [[Oberyn Martell]] unfortunate, describing him as half-mad while he believes [[Doran Martell]] to be a reasoned man who weighs the consequences of words and actions. Tyrion asks whether it is true that Oberyn tried to continue [[Robert\'s Rebellion|the war]] on behalf of [[Viserys Targaryen]]. Lord Tywin confirms it, recounting how [[Jon Arryn]]\'s negotiations with Prince Doran in [[Sunspear]] put an end to the conspiracy with both sides deciding to remain silent about the issue afterwards, but distrust between King Robert and House Martell remained. Tyrion proposes that showing Oberyn around in the brothels of the city could ease the Red Viper\'s impatience, jesting that he won\'t be accused of not serving House Lannister where he is needed most. Lord Tywin finds this comment very droll and asks whether Tyrion wants motley to be sewn for him, prompting Tyrion\'s question as to whether he would be allowed to say anything he wants about King Joffrey if he wore it. Lord Tywin declares that, while he had to suffer [[Tytos Lannister|his father\'s]] follies, he won\'t suffer his son\'s.\n\nTyrion is more serious now, predicting that Oberyn will not be pleasant, nor satisfied with only receiving Gregor Clegane\'s head. Lord Tywin reveals that he has no intention of sacrificing the Mountain, as he has served House Lannister well and nobody is dreaded as much by their enemies. Tyrion is shocked; he thought that he and his father agreed that the woods are full of beasts and that even Ser Gregor is disposable. He points out that Oberyn knows it was the Mountain who killed his sister and her children. Oberyn knows nothing and has no proof, Lord Tywin replies, he merely heard rumors and Ser Gregor is not likely to confirm them, in particular as Tywin will keep him away for as long as the Dornishmen are in the city. If Oberyn raises the issue, Lord Tywin will claim the murderer was Ser [[Amory Lorch]] \xe2\x80\x93 and the tale of Ser Amory\'s gruesome death by the hands of a bear set on him by [[Vargo Hoat]] would even appease Oberyn, he expects. Tyrion objects to his father\'s sense of justice, but Tywin tells him that it was in fact Ser Amory who found and killed Rhaegar\'s daughter [[Rhaenys Targaryen (daughter of Rhaegar)|Rhaenys]], also revealing that the child\'s mother and baby brother [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaegar)|Aegon]] were in the nursery below at the time. When Tyrion asks what he is going to tell Oberyn if he inquires who gave the order for the murders, Lord Tywin answers that Ser Amory acted on his own in an attempt to win the favor of the new king, as Robert\'s hatred of Rhaegar was well known. Thinking about it, Tyrion has to concede that this version might serve its purpose, although he suspects that the Red Viper will not be happy.\n\nTyrion\'s suggestion that it would have been better for his father to let Robert commit the murders himself prompts an astonished Lord Tywin to share his reasoning at the time of the [[Sack of King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing]]. He explains that they came late to Robert\xe2\x80\x99s cause, so they had to demonstrate their loyalty. When Tywin laid the bodies at the throne, it was clear they had forsaken House Targaryen, and Robert was clearly relieved, knowing that Rhaegar\xe2\x80\x99s children had to die for his throne to be secure, but not wanting to kill them himself. Tywin admits that it was done too brutally, and Elia did not need to be harmed. The Mountain only killed her because Tywin did not tell him to spare her. Tywin asserts that at the time, he had greater concerns than the Dornish princess; Ned Stark\xe2\x80\x99s van was rushing south from [[Battle of the Trident|the Trident]], and Tywin feared coming to battle with him, as well as the possibility of Aerys murdering [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] purely out of spite. &quot;That, and what Jaime himself might do.&quot; He also did not know what Gregor Clegane was capable of, only that he was huge and terrible in battle. He did not command Clegane to rape Elia, and Ser Amory was almost as bestial with Rhaenys. When Tywin asked Ser Armory why it had required fifty thrusts to kill a girl of two or three, he claimed she\xe2\x80\x99d kicked him and would not stop screaming. He states that if Lorch had had any wits, he would have calmed her with a few sweet words and used a soft silk pillow.\n\nTyrion asks whether it was a soft sweet pillow that killed Robb Stark. Lord Tywin reveals that the plan was to kill Robb at his uncle\'s wedding with an arrow, as he was too circumspect in the field. Tyrion inquires about the fate of Robb\'s mother. Lord Tywin suspects that the reference to &quot;a pair of wolf pelts&quot; in Lord Walder\'s message implies that Lady Catelyn is dead, too. The original idea was to keep her as captive, but maybe something went wrong, he suggests. Tyrion points out that the sacred guest right has been violated. Lord Tywin replies: &quot;The blood is on Walder Frey\xe2\x80\x99s hands, not mine.&quot; Tyrion, describing him as an ill-natured old lecher who nourishes the slights he has suffered over his long life, says he has no doubt that Lord Walder has planned the whole thing, yet he would never have dared to go through with it if he hadn\'t been given the promise of protection. Tywin counters that refusing him would have meant keeping him loyal to Robb Stark and prolonging the war. He considers the price that was paid low: The Crown will grant Riverrun to [[Emmon Frey]] as soon as the Blackfish yields, while [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]] and [[Daven Lannister]] have to marry Frey girls and [[Gerion Lannister]]\'s bastard daughter [[Joy Hill|Joy]] will be wedded to one of Lord Walder\'s natural sons, once she is old enough. [[Roose Bolton]] becomes [[Warden of the North]] and his [[Ramsay Bolton|bastard son]] will marry [[Arya Stark]].\n\nThe revelation that Lord Bolton was involved in the conspiracy is not particularly surprising to Tyrion, as Lord Walder probably had not the stomach to act alone. However, he is baffled about the role assigned to Arya and points out that neither [[Varys]] nor Ser [[Jacelyn Bywater]] were able to locate the girl, thus he is sure she is dead. Lord Tywin replies: &quot;So was [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]], until the [[Battle of the Blackwater|Blackwater]].&quot; Tyrion doesn\'t understand what this means. Lord Tywin replies that Littlefinger might have succeeded where Tyrion and Varys failed. He suggests that the Boltons shall be fighting the [[Ironborn]] for a few years while the Crown will keep an eye on their efforts to subjugate the Starks\' other bannermen. Lord Tywin expects that the remaining insurgents will be ready to yield by spring, also pointing out that the North will eventually go to the son of Tyrion and Sansa. In this context, he reminds Tyrion that Joffrey is not the only one who must take a maidenhead. Tyrion asks his father acidly when he believes his wife to be most fertile; before or after he tells her that the Lannisters have killed her mother and brother.\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Sansa Stark]]\n*[[Podrick Payne]]\n*[[Boros Blount]]\n*[[Tywin Lannister]]\n*[[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n*[[Cersei Lannister]]\n*[[Kevan Lannister]]\n*[[Pycelle]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Tremond Gargalen]]\n*[[Mace Tyrell]]\n*[[Olenna Redwyne]]\n*[[Ellaria Sand]]\n*[[Oberyn Martell]]\n*[[Petyr Baelish]]\n*[[Bronn]]\n*[[Roslin Frey]]\n*[[Walder Frey]]\n*[[Edmure Tully]]\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Balon Greyjoy]]\n*[[Catelyn Tully]]\n*[[Brynden Tully]]\n*[[Jonos Bracken]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Tytos Blackwood]]\n*[[Gregor Clegane]]\n*[[Aerys II Targaryen]]\n*[[Ilyn Payne]]\n*[[Margaery Tyrell]]\n*[[Rhaegar Targaryen]]\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n*[[Viserys Targaryen]]\n*[[Doran Martell]]\n*[[Jon Arryn]]\n*[[Lewyn Martell]]\n*[[Tytos Lannister]]\n*[[Amory Lorch]]\n*[[Elia Martell]]\n*[[Rhaenys Targaryen (daughter of Rhaegar)|Rhaenys Targaryen]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaegar)|Aegon Targaryen]]\n*[[Vargo Hoat]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n*[[Jaime Lannister]]\n*[[Joyeuse Erenford]]\n*[[Emmon Frey]]\n*[[Lancel Lannister]]\n*[[Daven Lannister]]\n*[[Joy Hill]]\n*[[Roose Bolton]]\n*[[Arya Stark]]\n*[[Varys]]\n*[[Jacelyn Bywater]]\n*[[Renly Baratheon]]\n*[[Ramsay Bolton]]\n|}\n\n==Places mentioned==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n*[[Red Keep]]\n*[[Flea Bottom]]\n*[[Tower of the Hand]]\n*[[The Twins]]\n*[[Highgarden]]\n*[[Casterly Rock]]\n*[[Dorne]]\n*[[Riverrun]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n*[[Seagard]]\n*[[Harrenhal]]\n*[[Vale of Arryn]]\n*[[Sunspear]]\n*[[King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing]]\n*[[Trident]]\n*[[Blackwater Rush]]\n*[[Dreadfort]]\n|}\n\n==References and Notes==\n* The original version of the synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/06/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-31 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Part 31].

[[Tywin Lannister]] is now [[Hand of the King|Hand]], and many are rewarded for their service to [[House Lannister]] during the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], with over 600 new knights made. Ser [[Loras Tyrell]] is named a member of Joffrey\xe2\x80\x99s [[Kingsguard]], and [[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]] is betrothed to Joffrey. With this, Sansa\'s betrothal to Joffrey is ended, to her great relief. [[Mace Tyrell]] is named to the King\xe2\x80\x99s [[Small Council|small council]]. \n\nMany of the great lords sworn to [[Casterly Rock]] and [[Highgarden]] receive honors, and many hedge knights and freeriders as well. [[Lothor Brune]] is knighted, and called Apple-Eater for defeating several [[House Fossoway|Fossoway]]s; [[Philip Foote]] is granted the lands of Lord [[Bryce Caron]] and elevated to lord. [[Hallyne]] the Pyromancer is named lord, but given no lands, and [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]] is named lord and given the land of the [[House Darry|Darrys]], except he may die or lose his arm from the wounds he suffered. [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] is granted [[Harrenhal]] and named [[Lord Paramount of the Trident]] for negotiating the treaty which brought the [[House Tyrell|Tyrells]] to the aid of [[King\'s Landing]]. \n\nWhen the captives are brought in, many swear fealty to Joffrey, but several are killed for openly ridiculing the King and refusing to bend the knee. Later that night, Sansa goes to the [[godswood]] and meets [[Dontos Hollard]], who is sad because the [[Cersei Lannister|Queen]] still has plans for Sansa, and her escape will be impossible while the Queen is watching. However, Dontos does reveal that they will escape during Joffrey\xe2\x80\x99s wedding in about a month. Dontos then gives her a hair net that resembles a silver spiderweb with amethysts in it. He tells her to wear it, for &quot;It\xe2\x80\x99s magic, you see. It\xe2\x80\x99s justice you hold. It\xe2\x80\x99s vengeance for [[Eddard Stark|your father]]. It\xe2\x80\x99s home.&quot;\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n\n* The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n* [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2012/02/re-read-sansa-viii-from-adventures-of.html Analyses and summary of the chapter] in the course of a 10th reread by Slynt\n* [http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/08/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-31 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 65]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Sansa Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 65]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 66, Sansa]]</text>\n      <sha1>qhynycz94ov612au05q1fvxd1c4i0gx</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Game of Thrones-Chapter 18</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>3648</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>193044</id>\n      <parentid>165961</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-09-08T18:49:01Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Nittanian</username>\n        <id>3504</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5736">{{Infobox Chapter AGoT\n| pov\t\t= [[Catelyn Tully]]\n| place         = Aboard the \'\'[[Storm Dancer]]\'\' in [[Blackwater Bay]] - [[King\'s Landing]]\n| title\t\t= Catelyn IV\n| page\t\t= \n| previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 17|Bran III]]\n| current\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 18|Catelyn IV]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 19|Jon III]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 14|Catelyn III]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 28|Catelyn V]]\n}} __NOTOC__\n\n[[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] and Ser [[Rodrik Cassel|Rodrik]] arrive in [[King\'s Landing]] by ship. At a secret meeting with [[Petyr Baelish]] and [[Varys]], Catelyn is told the [[Valyrian steel dagger|assassin\'s knife]] belonged to [[Tyrion Lannister]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nAs their ship \'\'[[Storm Dancer]]\'\' prepares to dock in [[King\'s Landing]], [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] is joined on deck by Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]]. Catelyn notes that Rodrik looks much better than he has for days. Rodrik has been chronically seasick throughout the voyage, forcing him to shave his befouled cheek whiskers. \n\n[[File:Sardag littlefinger.jpg|thumb|170px|left|Petyr &quot;Littlefinger&quot; Baelish, Master of Coin - \xc2\xa9 Sardag]]  \nAfter Captain [[Moreo Tumitis]] leaves them, Catelyn and Rodrik discuss how to go about their investigation of the dagger. Catelyn suggests speaking to the [[Red Keep]]\'s master-at-arms, Ser [[Aron Santagar]], who may recognize the weapon. Rodrik reminds Catelyn that they must be careful she is not recognized. This brings Lord [[Petyr Baelish]], the king\'s [[master of coin]], to Catelyn\'s mind. Baelish\xe2\x80\x94still known by the nickname \xe2\x80\x9cLittlefinger\xe2\x80\x9d given to him by her brother [[Edmure Tully|Edmure]]\xe2\x80\x94was raised with her at [[Riverrun]] as her father [[Hoster Tully|Hoster\'s]] ward. They had been close until Petyr had challenged Catelyn\'s betrothed, [[Brandon Stark]], for her hand. Brandon had only spared Petyr because Catelyn had pleaded for his life. After his recovery, Petyr had been sent away and Catelyn has not seen him since. Rodrik proposes that he go to the Red Keep alone because, without his whiskers, he is unrecognizable even to the few who might know him.\n\nAfter they disembark, Catelyn and Ser Rodrik move into a modest old inn suggested by the ship\'s captain. After Rodrik leaves, Catelyn tries to get some sleep but is woken by the [[City Watch of King\'s Landing]]. They show her a seal depicting a mockingbird in grey wax, the sigil of Petyr Baelish. As she prepares to accompany the soldiers (who do not recognize her), Catelyn wonders how Petyr knew she was in King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing and settles on \'\'Storm Dancer\'s\'\' captain as the culprit.\n\nCatelyn is escorted to a tower room occupied by Petyr. When Catelyn asks how he knew she was in the city, Petyr replies that [[Varys]] knows everything that happens in the city. He does admit, however, that Varys does not know the reason for Catelyn\'s visit. Catelyn lies that she merely yearned to see her husband and daughters. Petyr does not believe this for a moment and asks Catelyn to let him help.\n\nBefore Catelyn can answer they are joined by Varys. After profuse courtesies, Varys asks to see the dagger. Catelyn is astounded by Varys\'s knowledge of things no one could possibly know and produces the dagger for inspection.  Upon examining the weapon, Petyr reveals that it once belonged to him until he lost it betting on Ser [[Jaime Lannister]] in the [[tourney on Prince Joffrey\'s name day]]. Petyr explains that when Jaime was unhorsed by Ser [[Loras Tyrell]], Petyr\'s dagger was won by [[Tyrion Lannister]].\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:20%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Catelyn Stark]]\n*[[Rodrik Cassel]]\n*[[Petyr Baelish]]\n*[[Varys]]\n*[[Moreo Tumitis]]\n\n| style=&quot;width:20%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Aegon I Targaryen]]\n*[[Aron Santagar]]\n*[[Baelor I Targaryen]]\n*[[Barristan Selmy]]\n*[[Bran Stark]]\n*[[Brandon Stark]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n| style=&quot;width:20%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Edmure Tully]]\n*[[Jaime Lannister]]\n*[[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n*[[Loras Tyrell]]\n*[[Luwin]]\n*[[Lysa Arryn]]\n*[[Maegor I Targaryen]]\n| style=&quot;width:20%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Pycelle]]\n*[[Renly Baratheon]]\n*[[Rhaenys Targaryen]]\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n*[[Stannis Baratheon]]\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Visenya Targaryen]]\n|}\n\n==Places Mentioned==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33%;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |\n*[[Aegon\'s High Hill]]\n*[[Blackwater Rush]]\n*[[Braavos]]\n*[[Dragonpit]]\n*[[Dragonstone]]\n*The [[Fingers]]\n*[[Free Cities]]\n| style=&quot;width:33%;&quot; |\n*[[Great Sept of Baelor]]\n*[[Ibben]]\n*[[King\'s Landing]]\n*[[Lys]]\n*[[Pentos]]\n*[[Red Keep]]\n*[[Rhaenys\'s Hill]]\n| style=&quot;width:33%;&quot; |\n*[[Riverrun]]\n*[[King\'s Landing#Street of Sisters|Street of Sisters]]\n*[[Summer Isles]]\n*[[Three Sisters]]\n*[[Tyrosh]]\n*[[Visenya\'s Hill]]\n*[[White Harbor]]\n*[[Winterfell]]\n|}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2009/05/catelyn-jon.html Humorous review of the chapter]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/05/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-10 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/019/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{EnWikia|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 18|small=yes}}\n\n[[Category:A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 18]]\n[[Category:A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Catelyn Tully|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 18]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in King\'s Landing]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 18]]\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 19, Catelyn]]\n[[pt:A Guerra dos Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 18]]\n[[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\x9a\xd0\xb5\xd0\xb9\xd1\x82\xd0\xb8\xd0\xbb\xd0\xb8\xd0\xbd IV]]</text>\n      <sha1>51vkht889hbu7psfpy78ar1viasdvd6</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Game of Thrones-Chapter 10</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>3436</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>165953</id>\n      <parentid>96398</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-17T14:09:00Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4513">{{Infobox Chapter AGoT\n| pov\t\t= [[Jon Snow]]\n| place         = [[Winterfell]]\n| title\t\t= Jon II\n| page\t\t= \n| previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 9|Tyrion I]]\n| current\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 10|Jon II]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 11|Daenerys II]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 5|Jon I]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 19|Jon III]]\n}} __NOTOC__\n\n[[Jon Snow|Jon]] says his last goodbyes, first to the comatose [[Bran Stark|Bran]], then to [[Robb Stark|Robb]], and finally to [[Arya Stark|Arya]], to whom he gives a [[Braavos|Braavosi]]-type [[Needle|sword]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Jon Snow|Jon]] climbs the stairs to [[Bran Stark|Bran]]\'s room with [[Ghost]] beside him, fearing that it might be the last time. [[Catelyn Tully|Catelyn]] is there, having never left Bran\'s side for close to a fortnight, which has kept Jon away, but now there is no more time. When Jon enters, Catelyn responds with hostility, asking why he is here and demanding he leave. While once this would have sent him crying, now it only makes Jon angry so that when Catelyn threatens to call the guards, he calls her bluff. \n\nJon finds Bran emaciated and shrunken, and the covers over his legs look wrong. Jon asks Bran not to die and tells him everyone is waiting for him to wake up. Jon remembers how much Bran was looking forward to the journey south while explaining that he is going north to [[the Wall]] with Uncle [[Benjen Stark|Benjen]]. Catelyn admits that she was wishing for Bran to stay home with her, and her wish seems to have been granted. When Jon attempts to reassure her, she lashes out at him and, as he is leaving, tells him that it should have been him that fell.\n\nJon makes the long walk to the yard, where things are in an uproar as the party prepares to leave. [[Robb Stark|Robb]] brings news that Benjen is looking for Jon. When Robb asks about his mother, Jon tells him she was kind. Robb then remarks that next time they meet, Jon will be all in black, and they hug farewell. \n\nNext, Jon goes to see [[Arya Stark|Arya]], who is repacking her things with help from [[Nymeria]], not having folded them well enough for [[Septa]] [[Mordane]] the first time. Jon says he has a secret present for her. After Arya closes the door and sets Nymeria to guard it, Jon gives her a small sword made specially for her, one like the swords from [[Braavos]]. He explains to her that she will have to practise every day, shows her how to hold it, and then gives her her first lesson: stick them with the pointy end. He then warns her not to tell [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]]. Arya runs to him for a last hug. Just before he leaves, Jon tells Arya that all the best swords have a name. When she asks what her sword\'s name is he explains that it\xe2\x80\x99s her very favorite thing.

Nevertheless, Dontos says he has a plan to help her escape and take her home. On her way back, Sansa runs into a drunken [[Sandor Clegane]], who escorts her back to her chambers.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] has found an anonymous note under her pillow telling her to come to the [[godswood]] tonight if she wants to go home. She continues reading it over and over, wondering what it could mean. She has prayed so hard for a true knight to save her, but perhaps it is only one of [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]]\'s cruel jokes or a clever snare to prove her disloyalty. She fears she will only find Ser [[Ilyn Payne]] waiting for her with [[Ice]].\n\nWhen her bedmaid enters unannounced to ask if she wants a bath, Sansa hurriedly hides the note. Worried the girl saw it, Sansa asks for a fire. Once the fire is lit, she orders the girl out and decides there was something sly in her eyes. Her servants are changed every fortnight to prevent her from befriending one, and Sansa is sure they all spy on her. Once alone, she burns the note.\n\nFrom her window, Sansa sees Ser [[Preston Greenfield]] pacing the drawbridge of [[Maegor\'s Holdfast]]. She is free to roam the whole [[Red Keep]], but Ser Preston will still ask where she is going at this time of night. Unable to think of a lie, Sansa crawls into bed instead, but her thoughts keep her awake. She wishes there was someone to tell her what to do. She misses [[Septa]] [[Mordane]] and her best friend [[Jeyne Poole]], and even her sister [[Arya Stark|Arya]], who she is sure is back in [[Winterfell]] by now.\n\nHearing shouting, Sansa looks out to see armed men running to the wall and Ser Preston gone from the drawbridge. Wondering what she is doing, Sansa dresses quickly and hides her meat knife under her cloak. After darting across the undefended drawbridge, she passes men arming in the yard and sees three [[Kingsguard]] helping Joffrey into his armor. Fortunately, Joffrey is busy calling for his weapons and does not see her.\n\nThe sounds fade as Sansa rushes towards the godswood, never daring to look back for fear of Joffrey. The godswood is quiet and there is a wild feel to it even in the heart of the city, and Sansa can feel the [[old gods]] watching her. She prefers [[Catelyn Stark|her mother]]\'s [[Faith of the Seven|gods]]--with their artwork, incense, rainbows, and rich fabrics and gems--but the godswood has a certain power too, especially by night.\n\nFearing she is too late, Sansa is surprised by the voice of [[Dontos Hollard]] saying he feared she would not come. When he reaches for her, Sansa shrinks back and reaches for her knife. Dontos insists he only wants to help her as she helped him. Sansa asks if he is drunk and Dontos admits he had a cup of wine to help his courage. Drawing her knife, Sansa asks who sent him. Dontos swears on his knight\'s honor that he came on his own, but Sansa recalls Joffrey\'s decree and says she prayed for a knight to save her, not a drunken old fool. Dontos accepts the rebuke, but says he hopes to find it in himself to be a knight again because of her, adding that Sansa not only saved him from Joffrey, but also from himself. \n\nDontos reminds her that [[Florian the Fool|Florian]] was both a fool and the greatest knight of all. He falls to his knees and asks to be her Florian. Still unsure, Sansa asks how he plans for her to escape. Dontos explains that the hardest part will be getting her out of the castle. Then a ship could take her home, but he needs to find coin and make arrangements without raising suspicions, which will take time since he is also watched. When Sansa puts away her knife, Dontos rises and laments that he did nothing to save [[Eddard Stark|her father]]. He then declares that he is not a hero like [[Ryam Redwyne]] or [[Barristan Selmy]] and has won no glory in war or tourney, but Sansa has reminded him what it is to be a knight. He pledges himself to her and vows to the old gods that he will send her home.\n\nAssured by his solemn oath, Sansa agrees to put herself in his hands. Then she asks if he will send another letter to let her know when, but he says that would be too dangerous. Instead, he instructs her to come to the godswood as often as possible since nowhere else is safe. She agrees, and promises to be brave, strong, and patient above all. Dontos urges her to leave, and Sansa kisses him softly on the cheek and calls him, &quot;My Florian,&quot; certain that the gods have heard her prayer.\n\n[[File:The hound by ammotu.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Sandor &quot;The Hound&quot; Clegane - by Ammotu\xc2\xa9]]\n\nOn her way back, giddily thinking about home and the songs about Florian and [[Jonquil]], Sansa caroms into [[Sandor Clegane]]. The Hound catches her before she can fall and asks if she wants to kill them both on the serpentine steps. When he asks what she is doing out so late, Sansa stutters that she was praying for her father and the king. The Hound replies that he is not drunk enough to believe that story, adding that although she is nearly a woman, Sansa is still just a little bird singing the songs they taught her. He mockingly asks her to sing him a song about knights and fair maids, and asks if she likes knights. Sansa answers \'\'true\'\' knights, but the Hound mocks her and reminds her he is not a knight at all. Reeling and almost falling, the Hound curses that he had too much wine, then offers to take Sansa back to her chambers. He pushes her gently and follows her down the steps.\n\nUpon their return, they find Ser [[Boros Blount]] guarding the drawbridge. Sansa flinches away, but the Hound insists Blount is not to be feared. When Ser Boros asks why she is not in her chambers, Sansa\'s lie about the godswood sounds more convincing than before. The Hound adds that she could not be expected to sleep with all the noise. Ser Boros explains that preparations for [[Tyrek Lannister]]\'s wedding feast have convinced some wretches that they should feast, too. He adds that Joffrey led a sortie that sent the fools scurrying. Clegane states, &quot;A brave boy,&quot; but Sansa wonders how brave Joffrey will be when he faces her brother [[Robb Stark|Robb]].\n\nAfter crossing the drawbridge, Sansa asks why the Hound lets people call him a dog but never a knight. He replies that he likes dogs better, and explains that his grandfather was a kennelmaster at [[Casterly Rock]] who received lands and a [[Clegane\'s Keep|towerhouse]] for saving Lord [[Tytos Lannister]] from a [[lion]], losing a leg and three dogs in the process. He adds that a dog will die for you and never lie to you, which is more than little birds can do. When he adds that he never got his song, Sansa suggests a song about Florian and Jonquil. The Hound dismisses it as a song about a fool and his cunt, but insists he will have a song from her one day, whether she wants to or not. Sansa replies she will sing for him gladly, but Clegane retorts, \n\n{{Quote|Pretty thing, and such a bad liar. A dog can smell a lie, you know. Look around you, and take a good whiff. They\xe2\x80\x99re all liars here... and every one better than you.\xe2\x80\x9d}}\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n*Analyses and summary of the chapter [http://slynt.blogspot.se/2011/08/sansa-ii-knight-at-godswood.html in the course of a 10th reread] by Slynt.\xc2\xa0\n*[http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2010/08/sansa-arya.html Humorous review and summary of the chapter] by Jason.\xc2\xa0\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/03/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-9 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 18]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Sansa Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 18]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 19, Sansa]]</text>\n      <sha1>ciq7m0cbbt326qs17ojjy3jgnjstda2</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Clash of Kings-Chapter 60</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6228</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166463</id>\n      <parentid>97269</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-23T21:00:04Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1864">{{Infobox Chapter ACfK\n| pov\t\t= [[Sansa Stark]]\n| place         = [[King\'s Landing]]\n| title\t\t= Sansa VI\n| page\t\t= 617\n| previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 59|Tyrion XIII]]\n| current\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 60|Sansa VI]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 61|Tyrion XIV]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 57|Sansa VI]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 62|Sansa VI]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] continues to receive word on the progress of [[Battle of the Blackwater|the battle]] from one of the [[House Kettleblack|Kettleblacks]].

She fails and learns that Stannis has sent a letter claiming that neither [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffery]] nor [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] are [[Robert Baratheon]]\xe2\x80\x99s sons. Even though there is no proof, she remembers that [[Lysa Tully|Lysa]] claimed that [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] killed her husband. Catelyn asks Renly\xe2\x80\x99s leave but is not given it\xe2\x80\x94he wants her to see him victorious in the morning. \n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Hallis Mollen]] announces to [[Catelyn Tully|Catelyn]] that they are the first to arrive at an area where the trees have been cut down by [[Stannis Baratheon]]\xe2\x80\x99s foragers to build siege equipment. Ser [[Wendel Manderly]] tells Catelyn that this is not their fight and Catelyn replies that she was sent here by [[Robb Stark]] and for the good of the realm it must be done, but forging a peace between the brothers will not be easy; she would prefer to be with her dying father [[Hoster Tully]] in [[Riverrun]] or back in [[Winterfell]]. In the distance she can see [[Storm\'s End]] and Stannis\xe2\x80\x99 army looking small and insignificant under its walls.\n\nCatelyn thinks about the history of Storm\xe2\x80\x99s End and of the love between the first Storm King, [[Durran]], and [[Elenei]], the daughter of the sea god and the goddess of the wind. After the wedding, Elenei yielded her maidenhood and immortality. Her parents unleashed storm and wind to destroy Durran\xe2\x80\x99s hold, killing all but Durran and his wife, who had protected him within her arms. It was the seventh castle he built that managed to withstand the storms. It is said that this castle was built with the help of the [[children of the forest]] or a child that became known as [[Bran the Builder|Brandon the Builder]]. \n\nStannis is the first to arrive with a [[Melisandre|Red Priestess]] as his standard bearer; Catelyn knows that [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]] will be last. Stannis expresses his surprise to find her here, and gives his condolences for her husband [[Eddard Stark]], though he notes Stark was no friend of his. Stannis is not grateful for Eddard\xe2\x80\x99s part in breaking the siege, saying it was on [[Robert Baratheon]]\xe2\x80\x99s command. He holds it against Eddard that he took the position of [[Hand of the King]], which he did not even want. Stannis tells her that regardless of his feelings for her husband, Catelyn will have justice for his murder; she responds that Renly promised the same, but she would prefer her daughters back. Stannis promises that her daughters will be found when he takes King\'s Landing. Catelyn thinks his tone implies dead or alive, and tells him that King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing is closer to [[Dragonstone]], but he is at Storm\xe2\x80\x99s End. He replies that he needs the power of the southron lords to take King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing, and so he must take them from his brother, who owes him loyalty and obedience as his elder and rightful king. Stannis then asks if Robb has thrown his lot in with Renly, and is told he is King of the North by the will of the lords and people, and only holds his hand out in friendship. Stannis replies that kings have no friends, only subjects and enemies.\n\nAt this point, Renly\xe2\x80\x99s party arrives with [[Brienne of Tarth]] bearing the banner. Renly asks about Stannis\' sigil and the priestess replies it is the fiery heart of the [[R\'hllor|Lord of Light]]. Renly says it is just as well since, if they had the same banner, the battle would be confused. Catelyn expresses hope that there will be no battle, and Stannis states that the [[Iron Throne]] is his by rights, and those who deny this are his foes. Catelyn tells them that this is folly with the [[Jaime Lannister|Kingslayer]]\xe2\x80\x99s host reforming at the [[Golden Tooth]], another [[House Lannister|Lannister]] host gathering at [[Casterly Rock]], and [[Tywin Lannister]] at [[Harrenhal]] with 20,000 men, and the Lannisters holding [[King\'s Landing]]. Renly immediately demands that Stannis bend his knee to him, and Stannis absolutely refuses, stating he is eldest and denouncing Renly as a usurper. Renly responds that the [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]] called Robert a usurper and he bore up under the shame. Catelyn tries to convince them to be reasonable, only to be rebuked by Stannis, who asserts that he is the rightful king; Stannis also adds that he considers her son no less a traitor than Renly, and promises to deal with Robb in due time. Catelyn asks how he is the rightful king, given that Robert had two sons, at which Renly laughs, stating that she has not seen Stannis\xe2\x80\x99 letter. Stannis tells Catelyn that [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] and his siblings are not of Robert\xe2\x80\x99s seed, but bastards born of incest between Cersei and her brother.\n\nCatelyn asks why Stannis kept this knowledge to himself, and is told that he approached [[Jon Arryn]] since he figured that Robert would be more willing to listen to Jon, whom he loved, as opposed to Stannis, from whom such accusations would have seemed self serving. Renly points out that Jon is dead, and Stannis states that his death was not by happenstance, that [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] poisoned him. Catelyn, immediately putting the pieces together, adds that her sister [[Lysa Tully|Lysa]] accused the queen of killing her husband. Renly tells Stannis that he may have the greater right, but Renly has the bigger army. \n\nRenly reaches under his cloak, and Stannis immediately goes for his sword, but Renly only brings out a peach, offering it to Stannis. Stannis retorts he did not come there to eat fruit, and Renly replies a man should never refuse a peach because life is short and as the [[House Stark|Starks]] say, \xe2\x80\x9cWinter is Coming.\xe2\x80\x9d Stannis thinks this is a threat but Renly states it was not, and he tells Stannis he never liked him, but he is of his blood, and if it is Storm\xe2\x80\x99s End he wants, he will give it to him. Stannis refuses, saying it is his. Renly states he refuses a peach, a castle and did not come to his wedding. Stannis sneers that the wedding was a farce, considering Renly married a woman he was scheming to make one of Robert\xe2\x80\x99s whores a year before. Renly corrects this, saying he was going to make [[Margaery Tyrell]] his queen, but Robert was killed by a boar, and so he got Margaery. He reveals he plans to have a son with her within a year, and then asks Stannis how many sons he has, telling him that if he had [[Selyse Florent|a wife that looked like Stannis\'s]], he would send [[Patchface|his fool]] to service her as well. Infuriated, Stannis draws his blade which shines strangely, roaring that he will not tolerate Renly mocking him to his face, but Brienne moves between them. Stannis tells Renly that he will not kill Renly with [[Lightbringer]], and will give him till dawn to pledge to him, for the sake of their [[Cassana Estermont|late mother]]. In return, Stannis will grant him Storm\xe2\x80\x99s End, a seat on the council, and name him his heir until he has a son; otherwise he will destroy Renly. Renly laughs, pointing out that he has the strength in banners: [[House Rowan]], [[House Tarly]], [[House Caron]], [[House Tarth]], [[House Penrose]], [[House Fossoway]], [[House Cuy]], [[House Mullendore]], [[House Estermont]], [[House Selmy]], [[House Hightower]], [[House Oakheart]], [[House Crane]], [[House Caswell]], [[House Blackbar]], [[House Morrigen]], [[House Beesbury]], [[House Shermer]], [[House Dunn]], [[House Footly]] and Stannis\' wife\xe2\x80\x99s [[House Florent]]. What is present is only the vanguard, with 100,000 foot still to arrive. After exchanging taunts, Stannis gallops away, the Red Priestess staying long enough to say before also leaving:\n\n{{Quote|Look to your own sins, Lord Renly.}}\n\nCatelyn tells Renly that his brother is the lawful heir if Joffrey is Jaime\xe2\x80\x99s son. Renly replies this is true only while he lives, and asks if Catelyn would agree that it is a fool\xe2\x80\x99s law since he would be a better king than either Robert or Stannis. He will be a great king: \n{{Quote|strong yet generous, clever, just, diligent, loyal to my friends and terrible to my enemies, yet capable of forgiveness, patient-}}\n\nCatelyn adds \n{{Quote|-humble?}}\n\nRenly laughs and states \n\n{{Quote|You must allow a king some flaws, my lady.}}\n\nCatelyn feels very tired; she has failed, and her son will have to face the Lannisters alone while the Baratheon brothers destroy each other. She thinks how much Renly is like his brother Robert, but Robert had Eddard to temper him. Eddard would have prevailed on Robert to bring the whole force to besiege Stannis, the besieger, instead of forging ahead with only the horses and no fodder. Now he must come to battle soon or starve. Catelyn accompanies Renly back to his pavilion, sending Hal Mollen to tend to the horses. \n\nOnce inside, Renly states his brother has not changed, and since he will not take his gifts, maybe he should fight. Lord [[Mathis Rowan]] points out that the castle is well provisioned and has a strong garrison under Ser [[Cortnay Penrose]]; they can let Stannis have a profitless siege. Renly, however, is concerned that men will say he fears Stannis. Lord [[Randyll Tarly]] thinks they cannot leave him unblooded since he may grow stronger than Renly, and the others seem to agree. Renly decides that they will fight. At this, Catelyn sees no point in not returning to Riverrun, so she asks to leave, but is told she cannot; she must watch so she can tell her son what happens to rebels.\n\nRenly then gives command of the center to Lord Mathis Rowan, the left to [[Bryce Caron]], and the reserve to Lord [[Eldon Estermont]], while Renly takes the right. Lord Mathis Rowan asks who will have the van, and Ser [[Jon Fossoway]] first asks the honor, but Ser [[Guyard Morrigen|Guyard the Green]] states that it should be one of the seven. [[Randyll Tarly]] states he led [[Mace Tyrell]]\xe2\x80\x99s van since before most of those present were born. After a clamor fills the pavilion, Renly gives the honor to Ser [[Loras Tyrell]]. Ser Loras accepts and asks for one of his knights to ride beside him, so that the stag and rose can go to battle side by side.\nRenly gives Brienne this honor. She wants to fight by his side, but is told that there are four of the [[Rainbow Guard]] that will fight beside him. She accepts the duty, but requests that she arm him for battle. Renly accepts. Catelyn can hear someone snigger. Renly then asks them to leave him.\n\nBefore she leaves, Catelyn asks to visit a sept she saw in a village, and Renly tells Ser [[Robar Royce]] to provide an escort, but to return by dawn. Catelyn tells him he should also pray, not for victory but for wisdom. Renly tells Ser Loras to remain with him to help him pray. &lt;ref&gt;George R. R. Martin has confirmed that Renly and Loras have a relationship&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nSer Robar Royce is a member of the Rainbow guard and Catelyn knows him slightly, that he is known for his skill in the tourney, the son of [[Yohn Royce]], bannerman to [[House Arryn]]. She asks him about this and he says his father owes fealty as does his heir, but he is a second son. He is tired of tourneys and looking for glory. \n\nShe arrives at her camp to find [[Shadd]] preparing the meal, Hal Mollen dicing with three of his men, and [[Lucas Blackwood]] sharpening his dagger. Lucas asks if they fight or flee, and she says they pray.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n*Summary and analyses of the chapter [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2011/12/re-read-catelyn-iii-life-is-peachy.html in the course of a 10th reread].\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/04/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-15 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 31]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Catelyn Tully]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Storm\'s End]]\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 31]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 32, Catelyn]]</text>\n      <sha1>edtca09pzy6m19bgf27cpg8d6rj2afd</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Feast for Crows-Chapter 38</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5979</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>197227</id>\n      <parentid>183445</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2017-02-03T16:47:59Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Nittanian</username>\n        <id>3504</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6020">{{Infobox Chapter AFfC\n| pov\t\t= [[Jaime Lannister]]\n| title\t\t= Jaime VI\n| place         = [[Riverrun]]\n| page\t\t= 561\n| previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 37|Brienne VII]]\n| current\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 38|Jaime VI]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 39|Cersei IX]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 33|Jaime V]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 44|Jaime VII]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\nSer [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] and Ser [[Brynden Tully|Brynden]] face each other across the drawbridge to [[Riverrun]], alone for a parley during the [[siege of Riverrun]]. The Blackfish is aware of the oath Jaime swore to [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]], but the member of the [[Kingsguard]] makes it known he does not have the [[House Stark|Stark]] girls. He offers [[Edmure Tully]] in exchange for Lady [[Sybell Spicer]] and her children, but Brynden refuses, telling him he swore to [[Robb Stark|his king]] to keep [[Jeyne Westerling|his wife]] safe and won\'t hand her over to a Frey noose. Jaime responds that the girl has been pardoned and no harm will come to her, nor anyone else if Brynden yields Riverrun; they will be free to go or [[Night\'s Watch|take the black]] as they choose, but Brynden dismisses the offer, claiming that he and his men would rather die with swords in their hands than \'\'&quot;be paraded through [[King\'s Landing]] to die like [[Eddard Stark]]&quot;\'\'. Brynden adds that he is well provisioned for a siege and the Lannister and Frey casualties will be far higher than his own if they storm Riverrun.\n\nThe Blackfish also makes it clear that he believes Lord [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] had a hand in the [[Red Wedding]], though that will never absolve the [[House Frey|Freys]] for their breach of the sacred laws of hospitality. Jaime challenges the older knight to single combat, with each choosing a champion. When Brynden prods Jaime to face him himself, Jaime cannot help but rise to the bait. But the Blackfish is not so foolish as to trust that Jaime\'s terms would be honored. The parley over, Jaime rides back to his camp and calls his captains for a war council, resolved that he must break his vow to Lady Catelyn and storm Riverrun. \n\nThe lords of the [[riverlands]] who have bent the knee to the [[Iron Throne]] do not tolerate the Freys\' presence at the war council. Ser [[Ryman Frey|Ryman]] is too drunk to attend, but [[Edwyn Frey|Edwyn]] and [[Walder Rivers|Bastard Walder]] are present. When confronted by Lord [[Clement Piper]] as to the condition of his son, Ser [[Marq Piper|Marq]], Edwyn replies that he is still held at the [[Twins]] to ensure that [[Pinkmaiden]] is truly loyal to the Iron Throne. When Bastard Walder and Lord Clement nearly come to blows when Piper challenges Edwyn to a duel over a threat to Lord Clement\'s heir, Jaime silences them, ending the council prematurely. Lord Clement storms out, and Lord Vance explains to Jaime that as well as his first born son, several of Lord Clement\'s cousins and nephews accompanied Marq to the Twins, and are either captives or dead. When Edwyn denounces them as traitors and rebels, Jaime coldly retorts that the Freys first rebelled against the Crown with Robb Stark and then betrayed him, making them twice the traitors House Piper are. Jaime takes enjoyment out of watching Edwyn\'s smug attitude evaporate at that remark.\n\nSummoning Ser [[Ilyn Payne]] and Ser [[Lyle Crakehall]], Jaime heads straight for the Frey camp. He first has Payne cut loose Edmure Tully, and when Edwyn and his father, Ser Ryman, come forth to protest, he warns them to keep quiet. When Ryman persists, stating that he is the heir to the Crossing, Jaime punches him in the face with his golden hand. He then dismisses Ryman back to the Twins, sick of the man\'s whoring and drinking, and takes the bladed crown that his whore wears. When Jaime places Edwyn in charge of the Freys, Jaime witnesses a glimpse of the contempt Edwyn feels for his own father. Jaime also demands that Lord [[Walder Frey|Walder]] release all the hostages that he has imprisoned at the Twins.\n\nJaime asks that Ser Ryman\'s singer accompany him back to his pavilion, and has his squires draw a bath for Edmure. Jaime informs Edmure that he will be returned to Riverrun forthwith, and if he yields the castle, all will end well for him. \n\nThe terms are that the [[smallfolk]] can stay and serve Lord [[Emmon Frey]], Ser Brynden will be permitted to take the black along with any of the garrison who choose the same, and Edmure and his pregnant wife [[Roslin Frey|Roslin]] will be well-treated prisoners at [[Casterly Rock]]. If their child is a boy, Jaime says he will serve House Lannister as a page and squire, and they will grant the boy some lands when he gets his knighthood. If it is a girl, the Lannisters will make sure she has a good dowry when she is old enough to wed.\n\nWhen Edmure asks what will happen should he refuse to yield, Ser Jaime indicates that he will assault Riverrun\'s walls in waves, sending the ex-Tully bannermen first as fodder, then the Freys, and finally his cousin [[Daven Lannister|Daven]]\'s westermen, and he would demolish Riverrun and put all within its walls to the sword. As Jaime leaves the tent, commanding [[Tom of Sevenstreams|Ryman\'s singer]] to play &quot;[[The Rains of Castamere]]&quot; for Edmure, the former Lord of Riverrun pleads, \'\'&quot;No. Not him. Get him away from me.&quot;\'\'\n\n==References and Notes== \n*The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/08/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-feast-for-crows-part-27 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Feast for Crows, Part 27].

[[Sandor Clegane]] is brought bound before [[Thoros of Myr]], and Arya cannot believe how different the red priest looks. The Hound is to be judged by [[Beric Dondarrion]] and hanged if found guilty. Thoros is a changed man, no longer a fat priest with a fake flaming sword, saying, &quot;I am not the false priest you knew. The [[Lord of Light]] has woken in my soul. Many powers long asleep are waking, and there are forces moving in the land.&quot; \n\nWhen Dondarrion appears, Arya is appalled by his appearance. Once handsome, the man is now stick thin, missing an eye, with part of his skull crushed in, a noose scar around his neck, and a terrible wound through his chest. Dondarrion asks for charges to be made against Sandor, but the Hound spits at the accusations, laying them at the feet of his brother and others. But Arya accuses him of killing [[Mycah]], and the Hound does not refute that. The Lightning Lord sentences him to trial by battle, and it will be Dondarrion he faces. Before the fight, Thoros says a prayer to [[R\'hllor]], and then Dondarrion cuts open his palm with his sword, causing the blade to take fire. \n\nThe fight ends with Clegane\xe2\x80\x99s shield destroyed and his left arm in flames, but the Hound cuts Dondarrion from shoulder to breastbone. Sandor is screaming in pain and fear from the hideous burn to his arm. When Arya confronts him about Mycah, Clegane admits killing the boy, and suddenly Dondarrion appears, alive and leaning against Thoros, to tell Sandor he has gone to hell.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Arya Stark]]\n*[[Gendry]]\n*[[Sandor Clegane]] The Hound\n*[[Thoros of Myr]]\n*[[Beric Dondarrion]] Lightning Lord\n*[[Mycah]]\n*[[Greenbeard]]\n*[[Tom Sevenstrings]]\n*[[Mad Huntsman]]\n*[[Lem]] Lemoncloak\n*[[Anguy]]\n}}\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|2|\n*[[Hollow hill]]\n*[[Brotherhood without banners]]\n*[[Lord of Light]]\n*[[R\'hllor]]\n}}\n\n==References and Notes==    \n*The synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html]    \n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/02/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-19 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Part 19].

There he talks to a young whore with a [[Barra|daughter]] that has the look of King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]]. As they are returning to the [[Red Keep]], Ned\xe2\x80\x99s party is ambushed by [[Jaime Lannister]] and about 20 of his men. In retribution for the [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 28|abduction]] of [[Tyrion Lannister|his brother]], Jaime has Ned\xe2\x80\x99s escort killed. Ned\xe2\x80\x99s leg is broken during the fight, and he loses consciousness.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Eddard Stark|Ned]] finds [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] in the common room of the [[Chataya\'s brothel]] talking with an elegant [[Chataya|black-skinned woman]]. His guardsman [[Heward]] is gambling for the removal of clothes with a whore while [[Jory Cassel]] watches from the window. Ned declares his business done, and Jory moves to bring the horses around while Littlefinger makes a joke about what part of the king\xe2\x80\x99s anatomy the [[Hand of the King]] might be filling in for in a brothel. In no mood for Littlefinger\xe2\x80\x99s jokes, Ned gruffly declares he is no longer the Hand. Outside, it is raining as they mount up. As they ride the deserted streets, Littlefinger tells Ned that he is considering buying the brothel because brothels make much sounder investments than ships; they do not sink and pirates pay good coin like everyone else.\n\nAs they ride back toward the [[Red Keep]] in the rain, Ned remembers the night his sister [[Lyanna Stark|Lyanna]] was betrothed to Robert. Lyanna had told him that Robert would never keep to one bed. Ned, who had already held Robert\xe2\x80\x99s first bastard [[Mya Stone|daughter]], assured her that Robert was a good man who would love her with all his heart. Lyanna responded that one could not change a man\xe2\x80\x99s nature. After what he has seen this night, Ned cannot say his sister was wrong.\n\nNed\xe2\x80\x99s business at [[Chataya\'s brothel]] was to meet the prostitute with [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]]\xe2\x80\x99s bastard daughter named [[Barra]]. The child resembled Robert, and the girl was proud to show him that the baby had the king\xe2\x80\x99s nose and hair. Ned still remembers that Robert\xe2\x80\x99s firstborn had the same hair. The girl asked him to tell Robert how beautiful their daughter is, that she has not been with anyone else, and that she is waiting for him. Eddard vowed that she and the child would be well cared for. As he rides, Ned reflects that he is cursed to always keep his promises, while Robert can swear undying love and forget it by the morning.\n\nNed thinks about [[Jon Snow]] and wonders why the gods give men such lust only to frown on bastards. Ned then asks Littlefinger about Robert\xe2\x80\x99s bastards. Littlefinger says he does not know exactly how many there are. He goes on to speak in detail about Robert\xe2\x80\x99s acknowledged bastard [[Edric Storm]], the son of a [[Delena Florent|cousin]] to the king\xe2\x80\x99s [[Selyse Florent|sister-in-law]]. Littlefinger also speaks of a rumored pair of twins of a serving maid at [[Casterly Rock]] which [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] had killed. Ned is surprised that Robert would stand by and let such a thing happen, but then recalls that Robert seems to have grown adept at shutting his eyes.\n\n[[File:NedandjaimeMSM.jpg|400px|thumb|left|Jaime confronts Ned - by Mike S Miller \xc2\xa9]]\n\nNed asks why [[Jon Arryn]] would suddenly take such an interest in Robert\xe2\x80\x99s bastards. Littlefinger suggests that maybe Robert asked him to. Ned declares that Jon Arryn was killed for something more than that. Littlefinger says scornfully that maybe Lord Arryn had to be silenced for discovering Robert had bastard children, scoffing that next the man might be audacious enough to claim the sun rises in the east. Ned thinks of [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] for the first time in years, and wonders if the Dragon Prince frequented brothels; somehow he thinks not.\n\nSuddenly they are surrounded by at least 20 [[House Lannister|Lannister]] guardsmen. [[Jaime Lannister]] rides up and declares that he is looking for [[Tyrion Lannister|his brother]] who apparently had [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 28|some trouble]] on the road. Ned tells him that [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] took Tyrion prisoner to answer for his crimes. This causes Littlefinger to groan in dismay and Jaime to move forward and draw his sword. Jaime demands that Ned show his steel, declaring that he will butcher Ned but prefers it if Ned will fight back. Jaime then suggests Littlefinger leave if he does not want blood on his expensive clothes. Littlefinger needs no urging, but assures Ned that he will bring the [[City Watch of King\'s Landing|City Watch]].\n\nThe Stark guardsmen have drawn their swords, but it is three against twenty, so Ned reminds Jaime that if he dies, Catelyn will kill Tyrion. Jaime doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe him but is unwilling to chance it, so he tells his men not to harm Ned. Yet Jaime refuses to leave Ned entirely unchastened so he orders Ned\xe2\x80\x99s guardsmen killed. Ned and his men are quickly overwhelmed and [[Heward]] and [[Wyl (guard)|Wyl]] are cut down. Jory manages to break free, but returns almost immediately and is killed. In the confusion, Ned\xe2\x80\x99s horse slips and falls and Ned is blinded by the pain of his leg breaking.\n\nWhen he opens his eyes again, Ned drags himself through the mud. When Littlefinger and the gold cloaks finally arrive they find him cradling Jory\xe2\x80\x99s dead body. He is returned in horrid pain to the [[Tower of the Hand]], where Grand [[Maester]] [[Pycelle]] attends to his injury.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/07/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-18 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/036/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 35]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Eddard Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in King\'s Landing]]\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 35]]\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 36, Eddard]]\n[[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\xad\xd0\xb4\xd0\xb4\xd0\xb0\xd1\x80\xd0\xb4 IX]]</text>\n      <sha1>1yokhcg6268wz9fzeo79ep0lek8z36h</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Feast for Crows-Chapter 27</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5658</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>196516</id>\n      <parentid>180936</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-12-23T23:28:43Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Fyr</username>\n        <id>7293</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <minor/>\n      <comment>link added</comment>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3447">{{Infobox Chapter AFfC\n| pov\t\t= [[Jaime Lannister]]\n| title\t\t= Jaime III\n| place         = [[King\'s Landing]] - [[Hayford]] - [[Sow\'s Horn]] - [[Harrenhal]]\n| page\t\t= 391\n| previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 26|Samwell III]]\n| current\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 27|Jaime III]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 28|Cersei VI]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 16|Jaime II]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 30|Jaime IV]]\n}}\n   \n==Synopsis==\nAware that [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] is trying to rid herself of him, [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] argues that his place is beside the king, not off laying siege to [[Riverrun]]. But his sister responds that she can\'t rely on [[Daven Lannister|Daven]], and needs Jaime to defeat [[Brynden Tully]], as well as find out why [[The Mountain\'s men|Gregor\'s men]] at [[Harrenhal]] have not released [[Wylis Manderly]] as the crown requested. She states that [[Osmund Kettleblack]] will command the [[Kingsguard]] in his absence, although Jaime dislikes the idea. \n\nJaime\'s command consists of [[Kennos of Kayce|Kennos]], [[Dermot]], [[Lyle Crakehall|Strongboar]], [[Ronnet Connington|Red Ronnet]], as well as [[Ilyn Payne]] and [[Addam Marbrand]], whom Jaime demanded as concessions from his sister. \n\nOn the first night, they guest at Castle [[Hayford]], and Jaime considers the fate of his cousin [[Tyrek Lannister|Tyrek]], who would be lord of the castle were he not missing. He thinks it possible the boy is still alive, perhaps having been secreted off by command of [[Varys]], who very well could have known that the riot would occur.\n\nStarting that night, Ser Jaime begins training every night with Ilyn Payne, in the hopes that he can become a proficient swordsman with his left hand. The company also visits [[Sow\'s Horn]] and meets with Ser [[Roger Hogg]].\n\nArriving at [[Harrenhal]], Jaime has Gregor Clegane\'s men release all prisoners, including Wylis Manderly, and then leaves Ser [[Bonifer Hasty]] and the [[Holy Hundred]] to hold the castle until [[Petyr Baelish]] takes up its lordship. Jaime commands Bonifer to kill [[Sandor Clegane]] or [[Thoros of Myr]] if either are captured, but requests he send him any [[Bloody Mummers]] or [[Beric Dondarrion]] should they fall into his hands. \n\nOutside, Jaime comes across [[Ronnet Connington]], who mentions how he once was betrothed to [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]].

She warns [[Gendry]] and [[Hot Pie]]. They try to hide but one of their horses gives them away. They are discovered by three men: [[Tom of Sevenstreams]], [[Lem]] and [[Anguy]]. The men say they are [[Brotherhood Without Banners|Kingsmen]] and ask them to come with them to a nearby [[Inn of the Kneeling Man|inn]]. Arya hesitates but after Anguy shows how skilled he is with the bow she realizes that they stand no chance and she agrees. \n\nAt the inn Gendry remains in the stable to watch their horses although Tom assures them that they are safe. Arya and Hot Pie enter the [[Inn of the Kneeling Man|inn]] with the three men.&lt;ref&gt;The name is not given but the sign is mentioned: a kneeling king&lt;/ref&gt; The atmosphere is friendly. The men talk with the [[Husband|innkeeper]] and his [[Sharna|wife]] about the food and the last visitors of the inn.&lt;ref&gt;In [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 11|Chapter 11]] of [[A Storm of Swords]] it is described that the visitors were [[Jaime Lannister]], [[Brienne of Tarth]] and [[Cleos Frey]]&lt;/ref&gt; The innkeeper sold them horses and gave them directions. Tom and his friends were waiting for them to get the horses back but they did not see them. \n\nTom gives Arya a paper acknowledging a future payment of three [[dragon|dragons]] after the war for their horses. Arya protests and wonders how they will be able to reach [[Riverrun]]. Suddenly Gendry runs in to warn them that there are strangers outside. \n\nThe people in the inn are not worried but Arya is afraid that it will be Ser [[Gregor Clegane]]\'s men. She slams a tankard in Lem\'s face and tries to escape but to no avail. The men outside come in and among them, Arya recognizes [[Harwin]]. He recognizes her and proclaims her real name to the surprise of all.\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;66%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:2;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Arya Stark]]\n*[[Hot Pie]]\n*[[Gendry]]\n*[[Anguy]] \n*[[Tom of Sevenstreams]]\n*[[Lem]]\n*[[Sharna]]\n*[[Husband]]\n*[[Harwin]]\n| style=&quot;width:22;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned\'\'\'\n*[[Roose Bolton]]\n*[[Syrio Forel]] \n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n*[[Pate (Old)|Old Pate]]\n*[[Brienne of Tarth]]\n*[[Jaime Lannister]]\n*[[Cleos Frey]]\n*[[Fern]]\n| style=&quot;width:22;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned\'\'\'\n*[[Chiswyck]]\n*[[Rafford|Raff]]\n*[[Gregor Clegane]]\n*[[Hullen]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n*[[Jon Snow]]\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Vargo Hoat]]\n|}\n\n==Places==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;66%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:22;&quot; |\n*[[Trident]]\n*[[Gulltown]]\n| style=&quot;width:22;&quot; |\n*[[Harrenhal]]\n*[[Riverrun]]\n| style=&quot;width:22;&quot; |\n*[[Inn of the Kneeling Man]]\n*[[Lambswold]]\n|}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Storm of Swords: Chapter 13]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Arya Stark|A Storm of Swords: Chapter 13]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in the Riverlands]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Inn of the Kneeling Man]]\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{references}}\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/11/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-7 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Part 7]; summary and analyses of the chapter by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://slynt.blogspot.nl/2013/01/re-read-arya-ii-hot-pie-undercover-agent.html Re-read: Arya II, Hot Pie undercover-agent].

His brother tells him that he is to be beheaded on the morrow, and informs him that he coerced [[Varys]] into helping him charter a ship to take Tyrion from [[King\'s Landing]]. When Jaime tells him that the rescue was a debt he owed him, Tyrion presses his brother, and learns that [[Tysha]] was not a whore, but a crofter\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, just as she appeared. Lord [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] had forced Jaime all those years ago to lie about Tysha so as to teach Tyrion a lesson. Tyrion is infuriated that his brother never told him the truth, and punches Jaime in the face. Tyrion warns him that he will exact revenge against him, [[Tywin Lannister|their father]], and [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]], as a [[House Lannister|Lannister]] always pays his debts. Jaime then asks if Tyrion poisoned [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] and, lying in his anger, Tyrion admits to doing so.  He also tells Jaime that Cersei is sleeping with [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]] and Ser [[Osmund Kettleblack|Osmund]] and perhaps others, and that Joffrey would have been a monster worse than [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys]] if he remained king.\n\nTyrion stalks off without a further word, and confronts Varys for his betrayal. The eunuch concedes that he cannot find a trace of [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]], then leads him deeper down, to the fourth level where [[Maegor I Targaryen|Maegor]] had built torture chambers. When they come to a circular tower chamber with a ladder leading up, Tyrion realizes it leads up to the [[Tower of the Hand]]. Commanding Varys to wait for him, Tyrion ascends the wickedly high ladder. It leads to a secret passage behind the rooms in the Tower, perfect for Varys\xe2\x80\x99 &quot;little birds&quot; to overhear everything going on in the Hand\xe2\x80\x99s quarters. He opens the secret door to his old chamber, and finds [[Shae]] naked in his father\xe2\x80\x99s bed, with the Hand\xe2\x80\x99s chain of office around her neck. The whore pleads that the Queen made her say all those things against him in court, but Tyrion strangles her with the chain he once wore. Grabbing a crossbow off the wall, he finds his father in the privy. Tywin commands him to put down the crossbow, promising that he had no intention of carrying out the sentence, and would allow Tyrion to take [[Night\'s Watch|the black]]. Disbelieving his father, Tyrion questions him as to what became of Tysha. Lord Tywin reveals he did not have her killed, and doesn\'t know exactly what became of her. Tywin says he supposed the steward sent the &quot;whore&quot; on her way. Tyrion then asks where the steward might have sent her and Lord Tywin replies &quot;Wherever whores go&quot;. Tyrion fires the crossbow sending the bolt into his father\xe2\x80\x99s pelvis, killing Lord Tywin.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Jaime Lannister]]\n*[[Varys]]\n*[[Tysha]]\n*[[Tywin Lannister]]\n*[[Cersei Lannister]]\n*[[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n*[[Lancel Lannister]]\n*[[Osmund Kettleblack]]\n*[[Aerys II Targaryen]]\n*[[Sansa Stark]]\n*[[Maegor I Targaryen]] \n*[[Shae]]\n}}\t\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Red Keep]]\n*[[King\'s Landing]]\n*[[House Lannister]]\n*[[Tower of the Hand]]\n*[[Night\'s Watch]]\n}}\n\n\n==References and Notes==\n* The synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/11/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-50 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Part 50].

She is brought before the queen and the [[small council]]. There she is informed that her father is a traitor and is persuaded to write letters to her relatives explaining what has happened.\n\n==Synopsis==    \n[[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] is locked in a room with [[Jeyne Poole]], who does nothing but cry for [[Vayon Poole|her father]]. Sansa, thinking Jeyne was acting childish, has told her friend that she would ask [[Cersei Lannister|Queen Cersei]] to let her see her father, but it does not seem to have helped. \n\nSansa herself wept the first day. She was used to the sound of fighting in [[Winterfell]], but knowing it was real\xe2\x80\x94with angry shouts and the moans of dying men\xe2\x80\x94was different. At first she pleaded for news and to see someone familiar, such as her father or her [[Joffrey Baratheon|gallant prince]], but she got no answer. Then they shoved Jeyne into the room and she claimed they were killing everyone and that there were bodies on the steps. The next day the fighting was over and [[House Lannister|Lannister]] guardsmen patrolled the walls. The servants who bring them food and clothes refused to answer any questions. At sunset they heard the bells tolling from the [[Great Sept of Baelor]] proclaiming King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]]\xe2\x80\x99s death. Sansa is afraid for her beautiful prince and her father and at night she dreams of Joffrey on the throne with her beside him with everyone she knows coming before them to bend their knee.\n\nSer [[Boros Blount]] comes for her on the third day. Resolved to be a lady no matter what, Sansa complements the ugly knight. He leads her out of Maegor\xe2\x80\x99s Holdfast, where she sees a body impaled on the spikes of the dry moat. Rather than being taken to the queen\xe2\x80\x99s apartments, Sansa is brought to the council chamber and presented to Queen Cersei and the [[small council]], though her prince is not there as she was hoping.\n\nThe queen asks if she has been well taken care of and Sansa affirms that they have, though no one will tell them what happened. Sansa\'s use of the word &quot;us&quot; leads to confusion until Sansa explains that Jeyne is staying with her. Cersei is surprised to discover that Jeyne has been put in with Sansa and expresses concern about what absurd tales Jeyne might have told Sansa. Remembering her promise, Sansa asks about Vayon Poole, unable to imagine anyone killing a steward who does not even carry a sword. Cersei asks what to do with Jeyne and [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] states that he will find a place for her. The queen then instructs that Jeyne be taken to Littlefinger\xe2\x80\x99s apartments and that saying Littlefinger will take her to her father should calm her down. Sansa asks where Vayon is and where Jeyne is being sent, wondering why Littlefinger must be involved, but Cersei brushes off the question.\n\nCersei tells Sansa that Joffrey loves her, but that her father is a traitor. Varys and Pycelle explain that Lord Eddard, who had sworn to protect King Robert\xe2\x80\x99s children, was planning to turn the kingdom over to [[Stannis Baratheon]]. Then Cersei shows Sansa the letter her father wrote to Stannis, which has been taken off [[Tomard|the captain of his guard]]. Sansa insists that it cannot be true because her father was the king\xe2\x80\x99s friend.\n\nCersei informs Sansa that she cannot allow the daughter of a traitor to marry her son. Sansa is overwhelmed by the unfairness of taking away her beloved because of something her father did. Cersei states that she knew Sansa was innocent from the moment Sansa came to her with Lord Eddard\xe2\x80\x99s plan to take her away. Sansa insists that she did this because she loves Joffrey, remembering that she felt very wicked sneaking away to the queen. She had wanted to go to the king, but loud and often drunk King Robert had always frightened her. She had also believed the king would probably have just sent her back to her father. After having informed the queen of her father\xe2\x80\x99s plans, Sansa was locked in the high room in Maegor\xe2\x80\x99s Holdfast, under guard. A few hours later the fighting had started.\n\nThe small council discusses whether Sansa could also turn out to be traitorous. [[Varys]] and [[Grand Maester]] [[Pycelle]] opine that the child of a traitor is also likely to become traitorous. Littlefinger points out that Sansa reminds him of [[Catelyn Tully|her mother]] rather than her father. Queen Cersei expresses doubt that Sansa can be trusted since [[Arya Stark|her sister]] turned her wolf on Joffrey. Sansa replies that she is nothing like her traitorous sister; she only wants to be Joffrey\xe2\x80\x99s wife. \n\nQueen Cersei then suggests that if the rest of Sansa\'s kin prove loyal it would rest some of the council\xe2\x80\x99s fears. Therefore, Cersei asks that Sansa write to her lady mother and her brother [[Robb Stark|Robb]] explaining how Lord Eddard betrayed his king. Sansa does not know what to say, but Cersei assures her that they will provide her with the words. The important thing is that the [[House Stark|Starks]] keep the King\xe2\x80\x99s Peace; otherwise it will go hard on them and on Sansa. Sansa is also told write that she is being well cared for and that her family must come to [[King\'s Landing]] and pledge fealty to Joffrey. \n\nSansa asks to see her father, but is told that if she is truly loyal she should not want to see him. Sansa says she is concerned about him and what will happen to him. She is told that her father is well and that the king will decide his punishment. Sansa realizes that the king is now her gallant Joffrey, whom she knows would never hurt her father and who is sure to listen to her pleas. Perhaps her father will only be exiled for a few years. However, if her mother or Robb did something treasonous it will all go wrong. \n\nSansa agrees to write the letters and ends up writing four: to her mother, her brother Robb, her [[Lysa Arryn|Aunt Lysa]], and her grandfather [[Hoster Tully]]. When she returns to her room, Jeyne and her belongings are already gone. It is only when she is drifting off to sleep that night that Sansa realizes she has forgotten to ask about Arya.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/09/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-25 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/052/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes== \n{{References|2}}\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 51]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Sansa Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 52, Sansa]]</text>\n      <sha1>9ni7v1z81eq6dolsk22zaobe98is7rk</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Clash of Kings-Chapter 40</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6222</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166443</id>\n      <parentid>137893</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-23T20:53:56Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5095">{{Infobox Chapter ACfK\n| pov\t\t= [[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n| place         = [[Qarth]]\n| title\t\t= Daenerys III\n| page\t\t= 420\n| previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 39|Catelyn V]]\n| current\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 40|Daenerys III]] \n| next\t\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 41|Tyrion IX]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 27|Daenerys II]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 48|Daenerys IV]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] relates to [[Xaro Xhoan Daxos]] how the [[Pureborn]] have denied her, despite all the customary bribes and traditional proceedings she followed. Daenerys\' hope of obtaining ships and men from the Pureborn was in vain, and now she has to move on. The Pureborn are interested only in her dragons, not in her cause. She again beseeches Xaro for ships, but the merchant prince tells her he has no warships. He asks her again to marry him, and she again refuses. She considers going to the [[Warlocks]] for aid, and again Xaro warns her not to. As they move through the marketplace, Daenerys witnesses a firemage make a ladder of fire and climb it into the sky, as cutpurses move through the astonished crowd. Xaro declares the feat a fine trick, but [[Quaithe]] appears and tells them it was no trick.\n\nThe shadowbinder tells Daenerys that half a year ago, the man could scarcely make even a small fire appear, but his power has grown now, and all because of Daenerys, the Mother of Dragons. Quaithe warns, &quot;You must leave this city soon\xe2\x80\xa6or you will never be permitted to leave it at all.&quot; Daenerys realizes that Quaithe wants her to go to [[Asshai]], and when she asks why, the shadowbinder tells her it is there she will find truth. Her khas warn her not to trust the Asshai\xe2\x80\x99i shadowbinder, and Xaro concurs. Later, Ser [[Jorah Mormont|Jorah]] tells her she will find no help in [[Qarth|this city]]. He explains why Xaro wants to marry her: During a Qartheen wedding ceremony, the bride and groom each ask one thing from each other that the other cannot refuse. Ser Jorah is convinced that Xaro plans to obtain one of her dragons in this way. He tells her she should go east, but not to Asshai. When Daenerys suggests returning west to [[Illyrio Mopatis|Illyrio]], Jorah warns her that the Magister cares only for himself and would provide no help. Daenerys believes he will give her the ships and soldiers to retake [[Westeros]], but Jorah states, &quot;Nothing knits a broken realm together so quick as an invading army on its soil.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe reminds her that a man was sent to kill her when [[Robert Baratheon]] heard that she was pregnant, and fears what might happen when word spreads of her dragons. Daenerys wonders why the comet led her to Qarth if not to obtain ships and an army, and Ser Jorah implores her to go to [[Pyat Pree]] for help.\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n*[[Jhogo]]\n*[[Xaro Xhoan Daxos]]\n*[[Rhaegal]]\n*[[Aggo]]\n*[[Quaithe]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Drogon]]\n*[[Viserion]]\n*[[Jhiqui]]\n*[[Rakharo]]\n*[[Jorah Mormont]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Mathos Mallarawan]]\n*[[Wendello Qar Deeth]]\n*[[Egon Emeros|Egon Emeros the Exquisite]]\n*[[Viserys Targaryen]]\n*[[Rhaella Targaryen]]\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Paxter Redwyne]]\n*[[Aerys II Targaryen]]\n*[[Pyat Pree]]\n*[[Illyrio Mopatis]]\n*[[Drogo|Khal Drogo]]\n|}\n\n==Place and Terms Mentioned==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[Qarth]]\n*[[Temple of Memory]]\n*[[Hall of a Thousand Thrones]]\n*[[Faros]]\n*[[Lys]]\n*[[Yi Ti]]\n*[[Asshai]]\n*[[Vaes Tolorro]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[Jade Sea]]\n*[[Arbor]]\n*[[Summer Sea]]\n*[[Westeros]]\n*[[Valyria]]\n*[[Free Cities]]\n*[[Pentos]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[Dragon]]\n*[[Pureborn]]/[[Pureborn|Enthroned]]\n*[[Dothraki]]\n*[[Civic Guard]]\n*[[Keeper of the Long List]]\n*[[Milk Men]]\n*[[Sellsword]]s\n*[[Sorrowful Men]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[Stone Cow of Faros]]\n*[[Ancient Guild of Spicers]]\n*[[Tourmaline Brotherhood]]\n*[[Thirteen]]\n*[[Warlocks]]\n*[[Jogos Nhai]]\n*[[Iron Throne]]\n*[[Khaleesi]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[Common Tongue]]\n*[[Dragonglass]]\n*[[Wildfire]]\n*[[House Targaryen]]\n*[[Magister]]\n*[[Red Comet]]\n|}\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n\n*The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n*Summary and analyses of the chapter [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2012/01/re-read-daenerys-iii-go-west-by-east-do.html in the course of a 10th reread].\n* [http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/05/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-19 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 40]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Daenerys Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Qarth]]\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 40]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 41, Daenerys]]</text>\n      <sha1>hwztdm4p06u1kul1ir1mz083dzw8wsz</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Game of Thrones-Prologue</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>3337</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>197713</id>\n      <parentid>197712</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2017-02-28T13:56:01Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <minor/>\n      <comment>/* Places and Terms Mentioned */</comment>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6008">__NOTOC__\n{{Infobox Chapter AGoT\n| pov = [[Will]]\n| place = [[Haunted forest]]\n| title = Prologue\n| page = \n| previous = \n| current = [[A Game of Thrones-Prologue|Prologue]]\n| next = [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 1|Bran I]]\n| arc previous = \n| arc next =}}\nThree [[ranger]]s of the [[Night\'s Watch]] are tracking a group of [[wildling]] raiders [[beyond the Wall]], and encounter the [[Others]], who had not been seen for eight thousand years.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Gared]], [[Will]], and [[Knight|Ser]] [[Waymar Royce]], three [[ranger]]s from the [[Night\'s Watch]], are tracking a band of [[wildling]] raiders in the [[haunted forest]]. Will has reported on wildlings that he found, claiming they are all dead. Gared, an older man who has been in the Night\'s Watch for decades, is uneasy, and insists that they turn back to the [[Wall]]; they have eight or nine days of travel ahead of them, which can turn into a fortnight if it snows. Waymar, a noble born youth of eighteen, however, has the command, and after making light of Gared\'s fears asks Will again for the details of what he saw.\n\nWill explains that he saw the wildlings\' encampment. Their lean-to was covered by snow, they had no fire, and none of the wildlings moved the entire time he was watching. They were lying on the ground as if dead, but no blood was visible. Waymar suggests they might have been sleeping, but Will insists they are dead. There was also a woman up in a tree, but she did not move either. Gared suggests the wildlings must have been killed by the cold, but Waymar points out that the weather has not been cold enough to freeze men like that. He asks Will to lead them to the dead wildlings.\n\nWith night falling, the rangers ride back to the wildling camp. Both Will and Gared sense something is wrong, but Waymar mocks them again and commands Gared to stay behind to guard the [[horse]]s. When Gared suggests starting a fire, Waymar sardonically orders him not to. Will fears that Waymar\'s insolence will provoke Gared into drawing his sword, but Gared eventually acquiesces and no fire is lit.\n\nWill and Waymar climb up the ridge, Waymar much noisier than Will. When Will reaches his previous vantage point, he sees that the bodies are gone. Waymar, walking upright, reaches the top of the ridge and stands in plain sight. Will warns Waymar to get down, but Waymar just laughs. Determined to find the wildlings and make his first ranging a success, Waymar orders Will to climb a tree and look for a fire.\n\nWill reluctantly climbs a nearby [[sentinel]] tree. Below him, Waymar challenges an unseen foe. Will thinks he sees a white shadow moving below, but is not sure. He is about to call down a warning, but stops, unsure. Waymar calls to Will with unease in his voice as he turns in a circle with his sword drawn, and asks about the sudden cold, which Will also feels.\n\n[[File:Royce vs other.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Waymar Royce faces off against an Other. (art by Jon Neimeister)]]\n\nAn [[Others|Other]] emerges from the woods: tall, gaunt, and white, dappled with a gray-green shimmer. Waymar nervously commands it to come no further and prepares himself for battle, challenging the Other to &quot;dance&quot; with him. Will notes that Waymar, in that moment, is no longer a boy, but truly a man of the Night\'s Watch. When more Others appear among the trees, Will considers calling out a warning, but decides not to do so, as it would require him to reveal his position. The sword of the first Other is made of inhumanly-sharp translucent crystal. Waymar is able to check the oncoming blows until his parry comes a bit too late and the Other\'s sword cuts through the mail under his  arm. Waymar screams &quot;For [[Robert I Baratheon|Robert]]!&quot; and charges, but as his blade strikes the Other\'s sword, it shatters. One of the shards hits Waymar\'s left eye and he falls to his knees, blinded. All of the Others move in and slash at him mercilessly.\n\nWill turns his head away for a long time before looking back to see that the Others are gone. When he finally dares, Will climbs down, examines Royce\'s body, then picks up the knight\'s twisted and broken sword. He decides to bring it back to show to their commanders, hoping Gared is still with the horses. When Will stands up again, Waymar [[Wights|has risen]] and is standing over him. His remaining eye has turned blue. With an icy cold touch, Waymar\'s hands go around Will\'s throat.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Characters==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:50%&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Gared]]\n*Ser [[Waymar Royce]]\n*[[Will]]\n| style=&quot;width:50%&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Maester]] [[Aemon Targaryen (son of Maekar I)|Aemon]]\n*[[Lord Commander of the Night\'s Watch|Lord Commander]] [[Jeor Mormont]]\n*King [[Robert I Baratheon]]\n|}\n==Places and Terms Mentioned==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:50%&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[Beyond the Wall]]\n*[[Castle Black]]\n*[[Haunted forest]]\n*[[Wall]]\n*[[Westeros]]\n| style=&quot;width:50%&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[Direwolf]]\n*[[Horse]]\n*[[House Mallister]]\n*[[House Mormont]]\n*[[House Royce]]\n*[[Ironwood]]\n*[[Knight]]\n*[[Longsword]]\n*[[Maester]]\n*[[Night\'s Watch]]\n*[[Others]]\n*[[Sentinel]]\n*[[Sworn Brother]]\n*[[Free folk|Wildlings]]\n|}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2009/05/prologue-bran.html Humorous review of the chapter]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/03/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-1 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/001/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n[[Category:A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 00]]\n[[Category:A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV miscellaneous]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in the Haunted Forest]]\n\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Pr\xc3\xb3logo]]\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 01, Pr\xc3\xa9lude]]\n[[pt:A Guerra dos Tronos-Pr\xc3\xb3logo]]\n[[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\x9f\xd1\x80\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb3]]\n[[zh:&amp;#26435;&amp;#21147;&amp;#30340;&amp;#28216;&amp;#25103;-&amp;#24207;&amp;#31456;]]</text>\n      <sha1>lz9zjdinkmf2k7bm3r99wtdjz51dpgh</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Clash of Kings-Chapter 20</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6151</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>177784</id>\n      <parentid>166423</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-12-23T16:07:57Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Nittanian</username>\n        <id>3504</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17143">{{Infobox Chapter ACfK\n| pov\t\t= [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n| place         = [[King\'s Landing]]\n| title\t\t= Tyrion V\n| page\t\t= 225\n| previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 19|Arya V]]\n| current\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 20|Tyrion V]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 21|Bran III]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 17|Tyrion IV]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 25|Tyrion VI]]\n}}\n\n[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] visits the [[Guildhall of the Alchemists]] to discuss the production of [[wildfire]] then meets with Ser [[Cleos Frey]] about [[Robb Stark]]\'s peace terms. On the way back to the [[Red Keep]], Tyrion passes a prophet preaching of corruption and incest. When he finds [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] waiting in his solar, the pair argue about strategy and sending [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]] to [[Dorne]], which gives Tyrion the identity of an informer.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:Wildfire.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Tyrion inspect a jar of wildfire (\'\'[[Game of Thrones]]\'\')]]\n\n[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] is glad he took the advice to dress warmly, despite looking like a ball of striped fur bundled up in his [[shadowcat|shadowskin]] cloak. Deep under [[Rhaenys\'s Hill]], the chill in the dank vaults behind the [[Guildhall of the Alchemists]] is so bone-deep that even [[Timett]] retreated after a brief taste. \n\nBy the light of a sealed lamp, Tyrion inspects a fragile, grapefruit-shaped clay jar. The jar has a pebbled texture to keep it from slipping when grasped, and when Tyrion tilts it to peer inside the murky green [[wildfire]] oozes toward the lip. When Tyrion remarks on its thickness, the pallid and obsequious [[Pyromancer]] [[Hallyne]] explains that &quot;the substance&quot; (as the pyromancers call it) flows more easily as it warms.\n\nTyrion is annoyed by the alchemists\' pretentiousness. Their habits of calling each other &quot;wisdom&quot; and hinting at vast stores of secret knowledge do not match the reality of a declining guild in moth-eaten robes who no longer even pretend to transmute metals. The [[Maesters]] of the [[Citadel]] have supplanted the once-powerful guild in almost every respect\xe2\x80\xa9\xe2\x80\x95except the creation of wildfire, which remains a closely-guarded guild secret.\n\nHallyne explains that once kindled, wildfire cannot be quenched and will seep into cloth, wood, leather, or even steel and set them afire as well. Tyrion recalls from the flaming sword of [[Thoros of Myr]] that even a thin coating can burn for an hour, though it ruins the sword. When Tyrion asks why the wildfire doesn\'t seep into the clay pots, Hallyne explains that it does, and thus they have a lower vault full of pots from the reign of King [[Aerys II Targaryen]], whose fancy it was to shape the jars like fruit. By rights, those jars should be destroyed, but so many of the guild\'s masters were killed during the [[Sack of King\'s Landing]] that they lack the skill and have flooded the vaults instead. Hallyne adds that the [[wildfire plot|whereabouts]] of much of King Aerys\'s stock was also lost, such as a cache of two hundred jars discovered only last year under the [[Great Sept of Baelor]]. Hallyne admits this older stock can still be used, but urges extreme caution, since wildfire grows more volatile with age and will self-ignite if left in even direct sunlight for too long, causing it to expand violently and create a chain reaction among nearby jars. \n\nWhen Tyrion asks how many jars they have, Hallyne quotes the morning\'s count by Wisdom [[Munciter]] as 7,840 jars, including 4,000 from King Aerys\' older stock and says he is confident the guild will meet its promise of 10,000 jars. Tyrion is astonished, delighted, and terrified. He knows creating wildfire is a lengthy and dangerous process, and thought the number was only a wild boast. He insists he does not want any undue haste or defective wildfire, but Hallyne assures him the wildfire is prepared only by trained acolytes in work cells designed to fill with sand and smother any fires\xe2\x80\x95and the hapless acolyte. Tyrion is interested in inspecting how such a cell would work, but he does not have time.\n\nHallyne reiterates the importance of handling wildfire with care, suggesting that common soldiers in the frenzy of battle may not be as considerate as trained pyromancers, and any little mistake could be catastrophic. In response, Tyrion requests as many spare jars as possible to be delivered to each of the city gates. \n\nAs they walk back, Hallyne stresses the honor of welcoming the [[Hand of the King]] for the first time since Lord [[Rossart]], who was of their guild himself. The mention of Rossart reminds Tyrion of the stories of Mad King Aerys II using the alchemists to burn his enemies, and he decides it would be best to keep [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] well away from the pyromancers to prevent him getting the same idea. As such, when Hallyne proposes hosting a feast for Joffrey, Tyrion explains that Joffrey has forbidden feasting (at Tyrion\'s insistence) until the war is won. However, Tyrion has no objections when Hallyne instead proposes a demonstration of the &quot;dread secrets&quot; of his ancient order at the [[Red Keep]]; there is no harm in a few magic tricks.\n\n[[File:Alchemist\'s Guild Hall Jonny Klein.png|350px|right|thumb|The Alchemists\' Guild Hall - by Jonny Klein. \xc2\xa9 Fantasy Flight Games.]]\n\nAfter navigating the twists and turns of the Guildhall, they come to the long and echoing Gallery of the Iron Torches, where columns of wildfire flames burn around black metal columns and reflect off the black marble walls to bathe the hall in emerald light. However, Tyrion is less impressed because he knows the cost of wildfire means the torches have been lit only to impress him.\n\nAfter bidding farewell to Hallyne on the doorstep, Tyrion descends the broad steps to the Street of Sisters near [[Visenya\'s hill]] where Timett waits with his litter and an escort of [[Burned Men]], a most appropriate escort for a visit to the pyromancers and a necessary precaution since Joffrey rained arrows on a hungry mob at the gates of the Red Keep only three days past. Tyrion is surprised to find [[Bronn]] waiting as well, with two messages: Ser [[Jacelyn Bywater]] urgently requires Tyrion at the [[Gate of the Gods]] and Cersei commands him to attend her in her chambers. Tyrion decides to see Bywater first, as the man is not prone to waste his time and forcing Cersei to wait will make her angry and stupid, which he prefers to composed and cunning.\n\nThe normally-busy food market inside the Gate of the Gods is nearly deserted as Tyrion crosses it to meet Ser Jacelyn, who informs him that Ser [[Cleos Frey]] has arrived with peace terms from [[Robb Stark]]. Tyrion is  pleased, but Cleos proves reluctant to discuss the terms since his orders are to deliver them directly to Cersei. Gaunt and haggard from his journey, Cleos describes the dire situation around the [[Gods Eye]] and the [[kingsroad]], where the river lords are burning their own crops to starve the Lannisters, who are in turn torching every village and killing the smallfolk. Tyrion dismisses this as the way of war while Cleos adds that even with a peace banner his party was attacked twice by [[broken men]], losing three men and another six wounded.\n\nWhen Tyrion is amused by Robb\'s impossible peace terms, Cleos shares that Robb sits idle at [[Riverrun]], likely afraid to face Lord [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] in battle, and grows weaker as the river lords disperse to defend their lands. Tyrion wonders if that was his father\'s plan, then informs Cleos that the terms\xe2\x80\x95including the exchange of [[Willem Lannister]] and Cleos\' brother [[Tion Frey]] for [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] and [[Arya Stark]]\xe2\x80\x95are unacceptable, and Cleos will be expected to carry the [[small council]]\'s counteroffer back to Riverrun. Cleos is not pleased with the prospect of recrossing a war zone and points out that it is [[Catelyn Stark]] who wants this peace, not Robb. Tyrion counters that Catelyn wants her daughters and urges Cleos to rest and await further instructions.\n\nTyrion rejoins Jacelyn Bywater watching several hundred recruits drilling beyond the gate. With so many refugees, there is no lack of men joining the [[City Watch of King\'s Landing|City Watch]] for food and a bed, but Tyrion has no illusions about their worth in battle. He commends Bywater for contacting him and instructs him to give Ser Cleos and his escort every hospitality but to keep them outside the city to hide the truth of conditions there. He also instructs Bywater to use the jars the alchemists will deliver to train spitfire crews to handle wildfire using paint and burning oil. Bywater calls this a wise measure, although he has no love for &quot;alchemist\'s piss&quot;. Tyrion agrees, but insists he must use what he is given.\n\nBack in his litter, Tyrion reflects that if he can use negotiations to keep Robb dreaming of an easy peace at Riverrun until Ser [[Stafford Lannister]] readies his new host at [[Casterly Rock]], then Stafford and Lord Tyrwin can smash Robb\'s forces between them. Tyrion only wishes the [[House Baratheon|Baratheon]]s would be as accommodating. With [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]] creeping up the [[roseroad]] with his massive southron army and [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] poised to sail his fleet up the [[Blackwater Rush]] any day, Tyrion takes small comfort from his stockpile of wildfire.\n\nA commotion in Cobbler\'s Square pulls Tyrion out of his musings. A sizable crowd listens to the rantings of a prophet garbed as a [[Faith of the Seven#Begging Brothers|begging brother]]. Calling the [[red comet]] in the sky above [[Aegon\'s high hill]] &quot;the Father\'s Scourge&quot;, he proclaims:\n{{Quote|We have become swollen, bloated, foul. Brother couples with sister in the bed of kings, and the fruit of their incest capers in his palace to the piping of a twisted little monkey demon. Highborn ladies fornicate with fools and give birth to monsters! Even the [[High Septon]] has forgotten the gods! He bathes in scented waters and grows fat on lark and lamprey while his people starve! Pride comes before prayer, maggots rule our castles, and gold is all... but no more! The Rotten Summer is at an end, and the [[Robert I Baratheon|Whoremonger King]] is brought low! When the boar did open him, a great stench rose to heaven and a thousand snakes slid forth from his belly, hissing and biting! There comes the Harbinger! Cleanse yourselves, the gods cry out, lest ye be cleansed! Bathe in the wine of righteousness, or you shall be bathed in fire! Fire!}} \nWounded by being called a &quot;twisted little monkey demon&quot;, Tyrion takes solace from the hoots of derision drowning the echoing shouts as he orders the Burned Men to clear a path. He agrees with the prophet about the High Septon, however, smiling at the memory of a joke [[Moon Boy]] made at the gluttonous cleric\'s expense.\n\nReturning to the Red Keep without further incident, Tyrion ascends to his chambers in a hopeful mood, thinking all he needs is time to piece it all together. Entering his solar, he is confronted by Cersei, who is furious at him for ignoring her summons and plotting to sell her only daughter like a bag of oats. Knowing his [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 17|ploy]] has worked, Tyrion points out princesses like [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]] are born for such marriage alliances, unless Cersei planned to wed her to her brother [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]]. Cersei declares she will not allow Myrcella to be shipped off to [[Dorne]]. Without missing a beat, Tyrion points out that Dorne will be much safer than King\'s Landing, and the feud between the Lannisters and [[House Martell]] goes back only a generation, whereas the Dornishmen have warred with [[Storm\'s End]] and [[Highgarden]] for a millennium.\n\nTyrion explains that he proposed nine-year-old Myrcella become a ward of Prince [[Doran Martell]] until she turns fourteen, at which time she will marry [[Trystane Martell]], who is just two years older. Cersei insists Myrcella will be a hostage, but Tyrion opines that she will be treated more kindly than Sansa Stark, especially with Ser [[Arys Oakheart]] of the [[Kingsguard]] as her sworn shield. Cersei still worries that Doran Martell might kill Myrcella to avenge the murder of his sister [[Elia Martell]], but Tyrion insists Doran is too honorable to murder an innocent girl and the terms are too rich to refuse: he has also promised the prince his sister\'s killer, a council seat, and some castles on the [[Dornish Marches]]. Cersei accuses Tyrion of offering too much without her consent, but he insists Doran would not accept less and asks if Cersei means to offer sexual favors instead. When she slaps him, Tyrion promises her it will be the last time, but Cersei only laughs and suggests Tyrion\'s faith that their father\'s letter will protect him might be as misguided as [[Eddard Stark]]\'s faith in King [[Robert I Baratheon|Robert]]\'s last will. Tyrion notes to himself that unlike Lord Eddard he has the City Watch, his clansmen, and a party of sellswords, though he supposes Stark had delusions of support as well.\n\nRather than argue, Tyrion declares that Renly and Stannis will mount Myrcella\'s head beside Cersei\'s if they take the city. To his astonishment, Cersei begins to cry, something Tyrion has not seen since they were children. Awkwardly he moves to comfort her, but she wrenches away, which hurts more than any slap. He promises nothing will happen to Myrcella, but Cersei calls him a liar and declares he has not kept his promise to free Jaime. Tyrion assures her that Jaime remains safe at Riverrun until he can find a way to free him.\n\nCersei laments that if she were a man she would not have allowed any of this to happen. She wonders how Jaime could let himself be captured and questions what their father is doing hiding in [[Harrenhal]]. Tyrion assures her Lord Tywin is making war, proposing that Tywin is a lion waiting to pounce while Robb is a fawn frozen by fear. Cersei is not convinced, pointing out that Jaime would not sit idle if their father were the prisoner. To himself, Tyrion agrees that Jaime never had any patience, but he only says that not everyone can be as bold as Jaime, but there are other ways to win a war, and Harrenhal is strong and well situated.\n\nCersei adds that King\'s Landing is neither and Renly\'s host will soon be at their gates. Tyrion assures her the city will not fall in a day, giving Lord Tywin time to march down the kingsroad to take Renly in the rear. Hungry for reassurance, Cersei asks what will happen if Robb Stark marches. Tyrion explains that Harrenhal prevents [[Roose Bolton]] from crossing the [[Trident]] to reunite the [[Northmen|northern]] forces, and even if he could, Robb does not have the strength to take Harrenhal and march on King\'s Landing. Meanwhile, Lord Tywin\'s army lives on the fat of the [[riverlands]] and their uncle Stafford is raising another army at Casterly Rock.\n\nWondering how Tyrion knows all this, Cersei asks if Lord Tywin confided in him. Tyrion replies that he only looked at a map, which causes Cersei to accuse him of mere speculation. Drawing out Robb\'s peace offer, Tyrion asks why Robb would offer terms\xe2\x80\x95even unacceptable terms\xe2\x80\x95if he were winning. Suddenly all queen again, Cersei asks how the terms came to Tyrion instead of her, but Tyrion quips that his job as Hand is to hand her things. As he hands her the letter, Tyrion muses that getting slapped by Cersei is a small price to pay for her agreement to the Dornish marriage, which he can sense he will now get. The identity of an informer is just the plum in his pudding.\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Timett]]\n*[[Hallyne]]\n*[[Bronn]]\n*[[Jacelyn Bywater]]\n*[[Cleos Frey]]\n*[[Cersei Lannister]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Thoros of Myr]]\n*[[Robert I Baratheon]]\n*[[Aerys II Targaryen]]\n*[[High Septon (fat one)]]\n*[[Munciter]]\n*[[Malliard]]\n*[[Jaehaerys II Targaryen]]\n*[[Rossart]]\n*[[Jaime Lannister]]\n*[[Lancel Lannister]]\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Tywin Lannister]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n*[[Sansa Stark]]\n*[[Arya Stark]]\n*[[Tion Frey]]\n*[[Willem Lannister]]\n*[[Catelyn Stark]]\n*[[Stafford Lannister]]\n*[[Renly Baratheon]]\n*[[Stannis Baratheon]]\n*[[Moon Boy]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned\'\'\'\n*[[Crawn]]\n*[[Myrcella Baratheon]]\n*[[Tommen Baratheon]]\n*[[Doran Martell]]\n*[[Trystane Martell]]\n*[[Arys Oakheart]]\n*[[Varys]]\n*[[Aegon I Targaryen]]\n*[[Roose Bolton]]\n|}\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n*Analyses and summary of the chapter [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2011/09/re-read-tyrion-v.html in the course of a 10th reread] by Slynt. \n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/03/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-10 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 20]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Tyrion Lannister]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in King\'s Landing]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 21, Tyrion]]</text>\n      <sha1>53a5da5jrbd5fymfsqhpjp6ohxl3ra0</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 36</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5775</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>165222</id>\n      <parentid>117864</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-01T08:25:37Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Frernok</username>\n        <id>5007</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <comment>/*References and Notes*/</comment>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4531">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Davos Seaworth|Davos]]\n| title\t\t= Davos IV\n| place         = [[Dragonstone]]\n| page\t\t= 404\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 35|Catelyn IV]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 36|Davos IV]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 37|Jaime V]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 25|Davos III]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 54|Davos V]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Axell Florent]] brings [[Davos Seaworth|Davos]] before King [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]], taking the torch with him to leave his brother [[Alester Florent|Alester]] alone in the darkness. Axell tells Davos in private that he has seen Stannis\xe2\x80\x99 victory in the flames, and if Davos does not help him become [[Hand of the King|Hand]], he will see the Onion Knight killed. Stannis proclaims that Alester will die for treason,&lt;ref&gt;Interestingly, Stannis also states that [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]] \'\'\'died a traitor\'s death for trying to usurp [[Aegon II Targaryen|her brother]]\'s crown\'\', revealing a definite and perhaps surprising opinion about the rights of succession from [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys I]], the event that came to be known as the [[Dance of the Dragons]].&lt;/ref&gt; and has Axell tell Davos of his plan to invade [[Claw Isle]]. Davos calls the plan a folly, and Stannis dismisses the enraged Axell. Stannis mentions that [[Barristan Selmy]] once told him that &quot;the rot in [[Aerys II Targaryen|King Aerys]]\' reign began with [[Varys]]&quot;, and that [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] should have killed the eunuch, and sent [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] to [[the Wall]] as Lord [[Eddard Stark|Eddard]] had suggested, but Robert listened to [[Jon Arryn]] instead.\n\nStannis then raises Davos to Lord of the [[Rainwood]], Admiral of the [[Narrow Sea]], and his new Hand of the King. When Stannis mentions battle, Davos mistakes him to mean the continuance of the war, but [[Melisandre]] has entered the room and calls it &quot;the [[great battle]]\xe2\x80\xa6 Soon comes the cold, and the night that never ends&quot;. Stannis has also seen a vision in the flames, of men in black with torches on a high hill in the forest during snow, while all around them shapes were moving. Melisandre proclaims that Westeros must unite under King Stannis in order to defeat the one whose name must not be spoken. The King takes three leeches fat with the blood of [[Edric Storm]] and tosses them one at a time into a brazier, naming each of the false kings: [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], [[Balon Greyjoy]], and [[Robb Stark|Robb]]. Melisandre tells him that this is not the best way, for it both will and will not work. The better way is to sacrifice Edric Storm to the flames, for there is power in a king\'s blood: Melisandre believes that his death will wake the stone dragon, as prophesized, and the sacrifice of one life to save thousands of others is warranted, but Stannis will not hear of it.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Axell Florent]]\n*[[Davos Seaworth]] The Onion Knight\n*[[Stannis Baratheon]]\n*[[Alester Florent]]\n*[[Rhaenyra Targaryen]]\n*[[Aegon II Targaryen]]\n*[[Viserys I Targaryen]]\n*[[Barristan Selmy]]\n*[[Aerys II Targaryen]]\n*[[Varys]]\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n*[[Jaime Lannister]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n*[[Jon Arryn]]\n*[[Melisandre]]\n*[[Edric Storm]]\n*[[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n*[[Balon Greyjoy]]\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n}}\t\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Hand of the King|Hand]]\n*[[Dance of the Dragons]]\n*[[Claw Isle]]\n*[[The Wall]]\n*[[Rainwood]]\n*[[Narrow sea]]\n}}\n\n\n==References and Notes==\n* The original synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html]\n{{References}}\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/03/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-20 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Part 20].

At her sister\xe2\x80\x99s request, Catelyn makes the dangerous night ascent to the [[Eyrie]] to meet [[Lysa Arryn|Lysa]] and her sickly son, [[Robert Arryn|Robert]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File: Pojypojy_the_Eyrie.jpg\xe2\x80\x8e |The [[Eyrie]] - by Pojypojy \xc2\xa9|thumb|200px|left]]\n\nAs they approach the [[Bloody Gate]], Ser [[Donnel Waynwood]] tells [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] that she should have sent word before coming because the [[high road]] is no longer safe. Catelyn replies that they learned that to their sorrow, reflecting on the six men who died to bring her this far; three in the [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 31|first attack]], [[Lharys]] and [[Chiggen]] in the second, and [[Morrec]] of a festering wound. Only Ser [[Rodrik Cassel|Rodrik]], [[Bronn]], [[Marillion]], Ser [[Willis Wode]], [[Tyrion Lannister]], and Catelyn herself remain. They had been sure they were all doomed when Waynwood\xe2\x80\x99s men approached.\n\nSer Donnel goes on to explain that since [[Jon Arryn]]\xe2\x80\x99s death the [[Vale mountain clans]] have grown bolder and Lady [[Lysa Arryn|Lysa]] has forbade sending men out to fight them, though no one is sure why. Catelyn chooses not to mention that it is [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] her sister fears. Looking back at Tyrion, Catelyn notes the dwarf\xe2\x80\x99s confidence in the presence of a large party of men sworn to [[House Arryn]] and wonders again if she is wrong to suspect him. She is also unsettled by the cunning of the man; although he remains her prisoner, the dwarf now rides freely, armed with a dirk and an axe and wearing the [[shadowcat|shadowskin]] cloak he won gambling with Marillion.\n\nCatelyn asks Ser Donnel to send for [[Maester]] [[Colemon]] when they arrive to treat a badly injured Ser Rodrik. She is told that her sister has forbidden the maester to leave the [[Eyrie]] because of her concern for her son [[Robert Arryn|Robert]]\xe2\x80\x99s health. All that Ser Donnel can promise is the attention of a [[septon]] who tends to the garrison.\n\n[[File:Bryn-winterfell.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Brynden the Blackfish - by M.Luisa Giliberti \xc2\xa9]]\n\nWhen they arrive at the Bloody Gate, they are met by Catelyn\xe2\x80\x99s uncle, Ser [[Brynden Tully]], known as the Blackfish. Once they have passed through the Gate, Catelyn can see the richness of the [[Vale of Arryn]] spread out before her and the peak known as the [[Giant\'s Lance]] rising miles above the valley floor. Her uncle points out the faint glimmer of the seven towers of the Eyrie on the side of the mountain and says that they can reach the foot of the Lance by evening.\n\nWhen Ser Rodrik declares that he cannot go any farther, Catelyn decides to leave the rest of her party behind. Marillion the singer asks to accompany her to the castle. Catelyn, who cannot understand how Marillion survived the journey which killed so many others, agrees. Then Bronn, whose ferocious fighting helped cut their path to safety, declares that he is also coming. Catelyn dislikes the sellsword because of his lack of kindness and loyalty, and would prefer to separate the sellsword from his fast friend Tyrion Lannister. However, Catelyn cannot politely refuse after permitting Marillion to come and agrees.\n\nAs they travel, the Blackfish rides next to Catelyn. Catelyn recalls that her uncle was close to all the [[House Tully|Tully]] children and even [[Petyr Baelish]] when they were children despite a long feud with their father, Lord [[Hoster Tully|Hoster]]. It had been in defiance of Lord Hoster naming him the black goat of the Tully flock that Ser Brynden had taken a black version of the Tully fish as his personal sigil. Catelyn recalls that the feud ended after the dual wedding of Catelyn and Lysa to [[Eddard Stark]] and Jon Arryn, when the Blackfish left [[Riverrun]] to serve Jon Arryn in the Vale.\n \nAfter Catelyn finishes explaining her story, her uncle says her father must be warned, since Riverrun is right in the path of any Lannister attack. When Catelyn asks what the mood of the Vale is, he tells her that there is anger at the suspicious death of the much-loved Lord Jon and the giving of the title of [[Warden of the East]] to [[Jaime Lannister]]. Lysa has instructed everyone to call young [[Robert Arryn]] the \xe2\x80\x9cTrue Warden of the East.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nThe Blackfish also gives Catelyn the dire news that the young Lord Robert is unhealthy and cries when his dolls are taken away, leading some to whisper that he is too weak for the seat. Some even suggest that [[Nestor Royce]], who ruled as High Steward while Jon Arryn was serving as [[Hand of the King]], should rule until Robert comes of age. Others believe that Lysa should remarry, but the Blackfish thinks she is just playing at courtship and intends to rule herself. \n\nWhen Catelyn states that a woman can rule as wisely as a man, the Blackfish replies that the right woman can, but not Lysa. He explains that the death of her husband and the stillborn and miscarried children before that have left Lysa unstable and hysterically protective of her only child. Above all, Lysa seems to fear the Lannisters and now Catelyn has brought a Lannister to her doorstep. Catelyn insists that Tyrion is her prisoner. In reply, her uncle notes that Tyrion is not only not in chains but also carrying weapons with a sellsword trailing him like a shadow. Catelyn reminds him that Tyrion is not here by choice and that it was Lysa\xe2\x80\x99s letter that started the whole business.\n\nAfter passing through a valley surrounded by the high mountains, they reach the [[Gates of the Moon]]. Well above the gatehouse, Catelyn can see the looming mass of the mountain and high above the tower keeps of Stone, Snow, Sky, and then the Eyrie. Tyrion jests that if they plan to make him climb the mountain at night they might as well just kill him now. He is told that they will rest until morning.\n\n[[File:Heliotropa Mya Stone.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Mya Stone - by Heliotropa \xc2\xa9]]\n\nWhen the dwarf asks how one gets up, he is told there are steps leading up the mountain and trained mules that go as far as the way-castle called Sky. Beyond that the ascent is made on foot or in the winch baskets that bring up supplies\xe2\x80\x94the Eyrie is directly above Sky. Tyrion declines the offer of being sent up in a basket because his father would not approve of him going up like a load of turnips if the others ascend on foot, claiming that Lannisters have a certain pride. Catelyn responds that Lannisters have arrogance, avarice, and lust for power. Tyrion replies that his [[Tywin Lannister|father]] is the soul of avarice, Jaime has pride, and [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] lusts for power, but he is innocent as a lamb and will bleat for her. \n\nThe portcullis is raised and they are met by Lord Nestor Royce. Brynden asks for hospitality for the night, and is told that Catelyn has been instructed to go up tonight, but the rest can have the hospitality of the castle. Brynden is furious, considering night ascent to be too dangerous without a full moon. The guide [[Mya Stone]] then introduces herself and promises that no harm will come to Catelyn, citing her experience on a hundred night ascents. Stone is the surname of bastards in the Vale and that reminds Catelyn of [[Jon Snow|Jon]]. She is speechless, but Lord Nestor states that Mya has never failed him, and so Catelyn agrees to the night ascent. \n\nMya Stone guides Catelyn up the long path to the Eyrie in the dark, claiming that torches only blind one on a clear night. Mya then tells Catelyn that [[Mychel Redfort]], a squire she loves, says she has the eyes of an owl. Catelyn knows that, because his family is highborn, the squire will never be allowed to marry a [[bastard]].\n\nAt each way-tower they switch to fresh mules. The trip to the first way-tower does not seem too bad, but the next part is much steeper. At the next way-tower Mya explains that it is called Snow because, hundreds of years ago, this was where the snow began. At first Catelyn thinks that, as a Tully and a Stark, there is little in the world to scare her. However, when they must lead the mules across a high saddle between to spires of rock, Catelyn finds that she is too scared to move. Mya comes back and escorts her, blind and trembling, step by step across. At Sky, Mya explains that they must walk the last hour because the trail is more like a stone ladder. Catelyn states that, having travelled all day and the best part of a night, she will ride with the turnips instead. \n\n[[File:Lysa Tully and Robert Arryn TheMico.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Lysa Arryn and her son Robert \xe2\x80\x93 by The Mico \xc2\xa9]]\n\nCatelyn finds the Eyrie, which can house 500 men, strangely empty. She is brought to her sister\xe2\x80\x99s quarters. Lysa, now a plump, pale, and (to Catelyn\xe2\x80\x99s annoyance) well-rested woman, is polite until Ser [[Vardis Egen]] and Maester Colemon depart. Then she rages at Catelyn for bringing Tyrion to the Eyrie, and thus dragging her into Catelyn\xe2\x80\x99s quarrel with the Lannisters. Catelyn replies that it was Lysa who sent her the letter naming the Lannisters as the murderers of her husband. Lysa responds that it was a warning to avoid them, not fight them.\n\nRoused by his mother\xe2\x80\x99s voice, young Lord Robert appears in the door, grasping a doll. Lysa introduces Catelyn to Robert and calls him a beautiful and strong child, warning Catelyn not to believe the stories. Lysa insists that on his deathbed her husband said \xe2\x80\x9cthe seed is strong\xe2\x80\x9d to let everyone know what a strong boy his son was. Catelyn attempts to bring back the subject of preparing for war, but Lysa insists that Catelyn be quiet because such talk will scare Robert. Lysa then exposes her breast and the six-year-old grabs for it and starts to suck. \n\nThe sight makes Catelyn think of her youngest son [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]], who is half this boy\xe2\x80\x99s age and five times as fierce. Catelyn continues to press Lysa to discuss preparations for war. Lysa replies that even if the Lannisters could bring an army up, everyone says the Eyrie is impregnable. Catelyn realizes that her Uncle Brynden had tried to warn her about Lysa. Lysa then asks what she is supposed to do with Tyrion and Robert asks if he is a bad man. When Lysa replies that he is, Robert says, \xe2\x80\x9cMake him fly.\xe2\x80\x9d Lysa strokes the boy\xe2\x80\x99s hair and muses that perhaps that is just what they will do.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/07/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-17 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/035/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 34]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Catelyn Tully]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in the Eyrie]]\n\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 35, Catelyn]][[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\x9a\xd0\xb5\xd0\xb9\xd1\x82\xd0\xb8\xd0\xbb\xd0\xb8\xd0\xbd VI]]</text>\n      <sha1>qk2cpa1mztig42dv5hjq1tdffuam4bm</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 39</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6865</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166578</id>\n      <parentid>98749</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-25T16:16:28Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3154">{{Infobox Chapter ADwD\n| pov\t\t= [[Jon Snow]]\n| place         = [[Castle Black]]\n| title\t\t= Jon VIII\n| page\t\t= 514\n| previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 38|The Watcher]]\n| current\t= Jon VIII\n| next\t\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 40|Tyrion IX]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 35|Jon VII]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 44|Jon IX]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Jon Snow|Jon]] sends [[Val]] to the north, to find [[Tormund Giantsbane]] and offer him and his followers shelter south of the [[Wall]]. [[Bowen Marsh]], [[Cellador|Septon Cellador]], and [[Othell Yarwyck]] talk to Jon with various complaints; they disapprove of [[Leathers]] as Castle Black\'s master-at-arms, [[Satin]] as Jon\'s steward and his decision to negotiate with Tormund and allow him and his men through the Wall. They are also nervous about the fact Jon is keeping two corpses in the ice cells, and react with outrage and horror when Jon reveals he is waiting for them to rise, ignoring Jon\'s argument that the Watch knows next to nothing about the wights or their masters, and need to learn more if they are to defeat them. Overlooking their protests, Jon tells them of a large group of [[wildlings]] making for [[Hardhome]] at the east coast north of the Wall, following the witch [[Mother Mole]] who claims they will find ships there to bring them across the [[Narrow Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;And it does happen, although not necessarily to the extent or in the way that Mother Mole hoped or meant, in [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 45|Chapter 45 (The Blind Girl)]].

Angrily asking if they don\'t realise the truth or are just ignoring it, Jon points out that if they do nothing, the wildlings at Hardhome will die in their thousands, and when they are dead, in time they will rise up again with blue eyes and cold hands, and the [[Others]] will have thousands more [[wight]]s under their control to send at the Wall.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n* [[Jon Snow]]\n* [[Val]]\n* [[Samwell Tarly]]\n* [[Mully]]\n* [[Dolorous Edd | Dolorous Edd(aka Tollett)]]\n* [[Jack Bulwer | Black Jack Bulwer]]\n* [[Tormund Giantsbane]]\n* [[Stannis]]\n* [[Jarl]]\n* [[Craster]]\n* [[Melisandre]]\n* [[Arya Stark]]\n* [[Dalla]]\n* [[Ghost]]\n* [[Othell Yarwyck]]\n* [[Bowen Marsh]]\n* [[Cellador| Septon Cellador]]\n* [[Axell Florent]]\n* [[Selyse Florent| Queen Selsye]]\n* [[Wun Weg Wun Dar Wun]]\n* [[Leathers]]\n* [[Old Nan]]\n* [[Ygritte]]\n* [[Hodor]]\n* [[Iron Emmett]]\n* [[Satin]]\n* [[Jeor Mormont| Lord Mormont]]\n* [[Maester Aemon]]\n* [[Mance Rayder]]\n* [[Mother Mole]]\n* [[Cotter Pyke]]\n}}\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 39]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Jon Snow]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Castle Black]]\n\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 39]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 40, Jon]]</text>\n      <sha1>3bkmoeo4x8i54b1qur7dbsjvwwxmzsv</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>Arianne II (The Winds of Winter)</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>22243</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>197724</id>\n      <parentid>192143</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2017-03-01T12:06:49Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Casmir</username>\n        <id>6441</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <minor/>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3510">{{Warning|This information has thus far been released in a sample chapter for \'\'[[The Winds of Winter]]\'\', and might therefore not be in finalized form.

Tyrion apologizes to her, saying that it was his [[Tywin Lannister|father]]\xe2\x80\x99s wish to see them wed. During the ceremony, Sansa does not bend to allow Tyrion to place his cloak over her shoulders, causing embarrasment for the dwarf. At the feast, [[Garlan Tyrell|Garlan]] comforts Sansa, saying that Tyrion will make a good husband, &quot;He is a bigger man than he seems.&quot; When the time comes to have them bedded, Tyrion demands that there will be no bedding. He has to threaten [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] to keep him from making the tense moment worse. In bed that night, Tyrion realizes that Sansa is petrified at the thought of losing her maidenhood to him, and he tells her that he will not touch her until she wants him to.\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Sansa Stark]]\n*[[Cersei Lannister]]\n*[[Meryn Trant]]\n*[[Osmund Kettleblack]]\n*[[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Dontos Hollard]]\n*[[Balon Swann]]\n*[[Boros Blount]]\n*[[Varys]]\n*[[Addam Marbrand]]\n*[[Philip Foote]]\n*[[Bronn]]\n*[[Jalabhar Xho]]\n*[[Gyles Rosby]]\n*[[Ermesande Hayford|Ermesande Lannister]]\n*[[Lollys Stokeworth]]\n*[[Margaery Tyrell]]\n*[[Olenna Redwyne|Queen of Thorns]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Arryk (Guard)|Left]]\n*[[Erryk (Guard)|Right]]\n*[[Elinor Tyrell]]\n*[[Alla Tyrell]]\n*[[Megga Tyrell]]\n*[[Tommen Baratheon]]\n*[[Taena of Myr|Taena Merryweather]]\n*[[Mace Tyrell]]\n*[[Alerie Hightower|Alerie Tyrell]]\n*[[Kevan Lannister]]\n*[[Janna Tyrell]]\n*[[Meredyth Crane|Merry Crane]]\n*[[Paxter Redwyne]]\n*[[Mathis Rowan]]\n*[[Tywin Lannister]]\n*[[Moon Boy]]\n*[[Garlan Tyrell]]\n*[[Tallad]]\n*[[Orton Merryweather]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Willas Tyrell]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n*[[Ilyn Payne]]\n*[[Lancel Lannister]]\n*[[Loras Tyrell]]\n*[[Tanda Stokeworth]]\n*[[Sandor Clegane]]\n*[[Garth Tyrell]]\n*[[Leonette Fossoway|Leonette Tyrell]]\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n*[[Aegon IV Targaryen]]\n*[[Tysha]]\n*[[Mordane|Septa Mordane]]\n|}\n\n==Places and Terms Mentioned==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[Myr]]\n*[[Winterfell]]\n*[[Highgarden]]\n*[[Small Hall]]\n*[[Myr]]\n*[[Red Keep#Tower of the Hand|Tower of the Hand]]\n*[[Arbor]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[Direwolf]]\n*[[Septon]]\n*[[Kingsguard]]\n*[[House Lannister]]\n*[[Godswood]]\n*[[House Tyrell]]\n*[[Mother (the Seven)|Mother]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[Father (the Seven)|Father]]\n*[[House Stark]]\n*[[Bedding]]\n*[[Summer Tongue]]\n*[[Tysha#&quot;House Silverfist&quot;|House Silverfist]]\n*[[Septa]]\n|}\n\n==References and Notes==\n*The synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/02/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-16 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Part 16].

He strips Clegane of all lands, titles, and his life and sends a force under Lord [[Beric Dondarrion]] to dispense the king\'s justice.\n\n==Synopsis==    \n[[File:Marc Simonetti Bran theironthroneJoff.jpg|thumb|240px|left|The Iron Throne - By Marc Simonetti\xc2\xa9]]\n\n[[Eddard Stark]] is in the throne room where [[Robert I Baratheon]]\'s hunting tapestries have replaced the [[skulls of the Targaryen dragons]]. He is extremely uncomfortable after hours on the [[Iron Throne]]; the throne\'s spikes and jagged metal make it impossible to lean back and his shattered leg is throbbing more sharply each minute. [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]], who commanded his armorers to create the throne out of the swords laid down by his enemies, had said a king should never sit easy. At this point, Ned is damning both Robert and Aegon. His only conciliation is that at least he can sit, as can the three councilors in attendance: [[Varys]], [[Petyr Baelish]], and Grand Maester [[Pycelle]]. The rest\xe2\x80\x94including the petitioners, lords, and guards\xe2\x80\x94must stand.\n\nThe kingdom has been a tinderbox since [[Catelyn Stark]] seized [[Tyrion Lannister]], and Ned has the task of figuring out how best to stanch the hemorrhaging. Ser [[Karyl Vance]] explains that the smallfolk kneeling before him are all that remains of the holdfast of [[Sherrer]], while those of [[Wendish Town]] and the [[Mummer\'s Ford]] are all dead. The villagers tell of the brutality, murder, rape, and destruction. The [[Mountain\'s men|raiders]] were interested not in stealing but in destruction, making them [[House Lannister|Lannister]] invaders. Ser [[Raymun Darry]] continues by explaining that the people of Wendish Town took refuge in their wooden holdfast but the perpetrators burned the holdfast and shot anyone that tried to run out. The Sherrer holdfast was made of stone, so this tactic did not work.\n\nNed asks for proof that the raiders were from House Lannister and is told that there were 50 or 100 men, all mounted on war horses and armored in mail with good weapons. Their armor was plain and they flew no banners but the leader was as big as an ox: [[Gregor Clegane]], the Mountain That Rides. Pycelle points out that there are many large men in the kingdom, but the petitioning knights insist there is none as large as the Mountain. Pycelle asks why the Mountain, who holds lands and is an anointed knight, would turn brigand. Ser [[Marq Piper]] calls the Mountain a false knight and Lord [[Tywin Lannister]]\'s mad dog. Pycelle asks Ned to remind the knight that Lord Tywin is the father of their gracious queen, [[Cersei Lannister]]. Ned sarcastically declares that the court might have forgotten if Pycelle had not reminded them. It is then that Ned looks up to see men going out the door and also spots Septa [[Mordane]] with [[Sansa Stark]]; he has a flash of anger since this is no place for a girl, but calms himself that the septa had no way of knowing this was no ordinary day.\n\nLittlefinger asks where the knights responsible for protecting these holdfasts were when this destruction was going on. The petitioning knights reply that they had answered the call of their liege lord to marshal at [[Riverrun]] and below the [[Golden Tooth]] in anticipation of a Lannister invasion. They also declare that now Ser [[Edmure Tully]] has dispersed men to guard all the border holdfasts along the [[Red Fork]]. Ned thinks to himself that this may be exactly what Lord Tywin wants: to bleed off the strength of Riverrun as Edmure scatters his swords to defend every holdfast.\n\nLittlefinger asks what the knights are looking for from the throne if they have already protected their lands. They reply that, as they still keep the king\'s peace, they seek permission to retaliate. Ned is thankful that they have asked; Tywin Lannister obviously hoped to provoke a Tully invasion so that he might claim to be the aggrieved party. Pycelle insists that it is Lord Tywin\'s responsibility to dispense justice to his bannerman, Ser Gregor, but Ned reminds everyone that all justice flows from the king.\n\nPycelle immediately suggests that, in that case, they should wait for Robert to return, but Ned asserts his right as [[Hand of the King|Hand]] to speak for the king. He spies Ser [[Robar Royce]], whose father is hunting with Robert, and tells him to ride to the king and advise him of the situation. Ned refuses the petitioning knights permission for vengeance and tells the villagers he cannot give them back what they have lost, but can give them justice. He continues by telling the villagers that the [[First Men]] believed that the man who passes judgment should wield the sword, but his injury means he must send another to do his killing. Ser [[Loras Tyrell]] asks for the honor of slaying Ser Gregor, but Ned denies him, reiterating that the goal is justice, not vengeance. Ned looks at the assembled lords and orders Lord [[Beric Dondarrion]], [[Thoros of Myr]], Ser [[Gladden Wylde]], and Lord [[Lothar Mallery]] to each assemble twenty men. Ned also sends twenty [[House Stark guards]] of [[Winterfell]]. Lord Beric is given command, as befits his rank. Then Ned announces in the name of Robert that these men are charged with bringing to justice the false knight Gregor Clegane, and that Gregor is stripped of all lands and titles and sentenced to death. Then he tells them to ride at first light so it can be done quickly, and that the throne will hear no more petitions.\n\nAt the base of the throne, [[Varys]] is still gathering papers when everyone else has left. He declares Ned a bolder man than himself. He goes on to suggest that Ned should have sent Ser Loras, as a man who is an enemy of the Lannisters would do well to make the [[House Tyrell|Tyrells]] his friends. Varys also reminds Ned that it was a slight not to send Ser [[Ilyn Payne]] since he is the [[King\'s Justice]]. Ned does not like the man, but tells Varys that he would prefer not to send a Lannister man to kill a Lannister bannerman. Varys informs Ned that he saw Ilyn in the back and he did not look pleased, likely because he so loves his work.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/08/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-21 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/044/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==    \n[[Category:A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 43]]\n[[Category:A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Eddard Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 44, Eddard]]\n[[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\xad\xd0\xb4\xd0\xb4\xd0\xb0\xd1\x80\xd0\xb4 XI]]</text>\n      <sha1>sdx2rn8x3a7g65hzj0pj0zbdhpctuaa</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 36</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6860</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>193173</id>\n      <parentid>166575</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-09-14T09:40:27Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2935">{{Infobox Chapter ADwD\n| pov\t\t= [[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n| place         = [[Meereen]]\n| title\t\t= Daenerys VI\n| page\t\t= 473\n| previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 35|Jon VII]]\n| current\t= Daenerys VI\n| next\t\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 37|The Prince of Winterfell]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 30|Daenerys V]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 43|Daenerys VII]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] visits the thousands of [[Astapor|Astapori]] camped outside [[Meereen]]. She finds them sick and dying of the [[bloody flux]], and walks among them with her [[Bloodrider]]s. She does not fear catching the bloody flux because she thinks that the blood of the dragon does not get sick. She sends [[Aggo]] back to Meereen to fetch [[Grey Worm]] and 50 [[Unsullied]] to help wash and feed the living and burn the dead. Grey Worm asks for permission to allow some Unsullied to bathe in the sea to be purified by their goddess.\n\nDaenerys returns to her pyramid in Meereen, where [[Irri]] and [[Jhiqui]] are arguing about [[Rakharo]]. She takes a much needed bath and dons a [[tokar]] to dine with [[Hizdahr zo Loraq]]. [[Reznak mo Reznak]] and [[Galazza Galare]] inform her that her body must be inspected by the man\'s house before the wedding. Daenerys first refuses to follow this tradition but is then convinced to do so. She is asked to open the fighting pits as a wedding gift but refuses to do that.\n\nWhile waiting for dinner, Hizdahr informs her that [[Yunkai]] will make peace for a fee and the freedom to resume slaving, but then [[Barristan Selmy|Ser Barristan]] notifies her that the Yunkai\'i are on the march and [[Daario Naharis]] has returned. Daenerys excuses herself from dinner and meets with Daario.\n\nDaario informs her that several of Yunkai\'s sellswords defected to him,&lt;ref&gt;These are the Westerosi that the [[Tattered Prince]] sent for Daenerys, as seen back in [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 25|Chapter 25 (The Windblown)]]&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Brown Ben Plumm]] and the [[Second Sons]] in turn went over to Yunkai. Daenerys commands the gates closed (with the Astapori outside), and gives in to her desires and beds Daario.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n* [[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n* [[Barristan Selmy]]\n* [[Viserys Targaryen]]\n* [[Jhogo]]\n* [[Aggo]]\n* [[Rakharo]]\n* [[Symon Stripeback]]\n* [[Marselen]]\n* [[Reznak mo Reznak]]\n* [[Skahaz mo Kandaq]]\n* [[Grey Worm]]\n* [[Missandei]]\n* [[Irri]]\n* [[Jhiqui]]\n* [[Qezza]]\n* [[Hizdahr zo Loraq]]\n* [[Galazza Galare]]\n* [[Daario Naharis]]\n* [[Baelor I Targaryen]]\n* [[Cleon]]\n* [[Ben Plumm]]\n}}\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 36]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Daenerys Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Meereen]]\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 36]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 37, Daenerys]]</text>\n      <sha1>mg2pfvnz7iyonc3h6eszgt1zbahghan</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 48</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5697</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>183776</id>\n      <parentid>166619</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-05-08T21:10:46Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2875">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Jon Snow|Jon]]\n| title\t\t= Jon VI\n| place         = [[Mole\'s Town]] and [[Castle Black]]\n| page\t\t= 546\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 47|Arya IX]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 48|Jon VI]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 49|Catelyn VI]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 41|Jon V]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 55|Jon VII]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Jon Snow]] reaches [[Mole\'s Town]] and warns the populace to evacuate.

He scoffs at her attempts to abolish slavery in Meereen and tells her that the [[Thirteen]] are willing to trade with the city - in slaves. He offers her thirteen galleys if she leaves for [[Westeros]] immediately. Dany tells him she will have her men inspect the ships, and refuses his feigned advances to her.  \n\nShe also learns from Xaro Xhoan Daxos that [[Pyat Pree]] and three other [[warlocks]] sailed for [[Pentos]] soon after she left that city.{{Ref|ADWD|16|page 211}}&lt;ref&gt;Compare with Euron\'s tale of four warlocks with a curious tale in [[A Feast for Crows]], [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 29|Chapter 29]]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe next day at court, she refuses the desperate pleas of [[Ghael|Lord Ghael]] to defend [[Astapor]] against [[Yunkai]].

The [[raven]] arrived that morning, and Catelyn is beside herself with grief, despondent at the thought nearly all her children are dead or lost to her. She tells Brienne that she sent [[Jaime Lannister|the Kingslayer]] a bottle of [[wine]] to loosen his tongue. She means to question him, and is perhaps contemplating having the man killed since she has so little to live for anymore. \n\nAt midnight, Catelyn goes to interrogate Jaime, and asks Brienne to wait outside. Jaime mocks her at first, but eventually agrees to answer her questions if she agrees to answer his. Jaime admits to being the father to all of [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]]\xe2\x80\x99s children, and to throwing [[Bran Stark|Bran]] out the tower window. However, Jaime denies sending the assassin after Bran, saying, &quot;if I wanted your Bran dead I would have slain him myself.&quot; Catelyn questions him about the dagger that [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] claimed [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] had won from him. Jaime backs what Tyrion told her in the [[Mountains of the Moon]], that he always bets on his brother and lost at that tourney. Jaime admits that King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] mocked him with the dagger at the feast the night of the tourney, and Catelyn is dismayed that Littlefinger, who was like a brother to her once, would deceive her the way he has.\n[[File:MSMcatelyn jaime.jpg|Catelyn confronts Jaime|thumb|250px|left]]\nCatelyn then reveals that [[Robb Stark|Robb]] has recently taken [[the Crag]] from the [[House Westerling|Westerlings]], and marched ever closer to [[Casterly Rock]]. Jaime then steers the conversation to what really happened to [[Brandon Stark]] and Lord [[Rickard Stark|Rickard]] at the hands of the Mad King [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys]], perhaps to absolve himself of having slain the king. Brandon was on his way to Riverrun when he learned of [[Lyanna Stark|Lyanna]]\'s disappearance, and instead went to [[King\'s Landing]] with a handful of friends, all sons of prominent lords, and upon entering the [[Red Keep]], Brandon shouted for [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]] to &quot;come out and die&quot;. \n\nRhaegar was not there to answer the challenge, and Aerys had Brandon and his men arrested for conspiring to murder his heir. Aerys demanded the fathers of the men come to King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing to answer the charges against their sons; when they came, both fathers and sons were murdered at the command of King Aerys, with Brandon dying of strangulation trying to reach his father who was being burnt alive by Aerys\' pyromancers. Jaime was a young member of the [[Kingsguard]] when he saw all this, and it was Ser [[Gerold Hightower]] who told him, &quot;You swore a vow to guard the king, not to judge him&quot;, whom everyone consider a better man than him. \n\nJaime, now fully drunk, angrily rants that he is reviled for what he considers his finest act and begins to mock [[Eddard Stark|Ned Stark]]\xe2\x80\x99s honor, stating that unlike Ned, a man who fathered [[Jon Snow|a bastard]], he has never been unfaithful and that Ned had no right to judge him, the man who avenged his father and brother, but Catelyn has heard enough, and calls for Brienne\xe2\x80\x99s sword.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n* [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2012/01/re-read-catelyn-vii-dungeons-daggers.html Analyses and summary of the chapter] in the course of a 10th reread by Slynt.\n* [http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/07/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-27 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n* The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 55]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Catelyn Tully]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Riverrun]]\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 55]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 56, Catelyn]]</text>\n      <sha1>t1usc4t8tz8mu949fcmdnlxbd1rfq84</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Game of Thrones-Chapter 16</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>3551</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>165959</id>\n      <parentid>165871</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-17T14:11:57Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6262">{{Infobox Chapter AGoT\n| pov\t\t= [[Eddard Stark]]\n| place         = [[Darry]]\n| title\t\t= Eddard III\n| page\t\t= \n| previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 15|Sansa I]]\n| current\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 16|Eddard III]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 17|Bran III]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 12|Eddard II]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 20|Eddard IV]]\n}} __NOTOC__\n\n[[Arya Stark|Arya]] and [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] tell King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] very different stories concerning their [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 15|fight]] near the [[Trident]]. When [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] claims she does not remember, Queen  [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] demands the death of a [[direwolf]]. With [[Nymeria]] gone, [[Lady (direwolf)|Lady]] is sentenced to death instead.\n\n==Synopsis==\nAfter four days of searching, [[Vayon Poole]] comes to [[Eddard Stark|Ned]] with news that [[Arya Stark|Arya]] has been found unharmed. Ned is relieved that it was [[Jory Cassel]] who found her rather than Queen [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]]\xe2\x80\x99s men. Unfortunately, the [[House Lannister|Lannister]] guards at the gate informed the queen, who had Arya brought directly before King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]].\n\nNed rushes to the audience chamber of nearby [[Castle Darry]], which has been hosting the king\xe2\x80\x99s party during the search. He is dismayed to find the chamber full of people, preventing a private and amicable solution. Ned also notes that very few in the crowd are likely to be sympathetic to the Starks; most are either Lannister men or loyal to the local lord [[Raymun Darry]], a prominent [[Targaryen]] loyalist who lost family and fortune at the [[Battle of the Trident|Trident]]. However, Ned is relieved that neither [[Jaime Lannister]] nor [[Sandor Clegane]] are present.\n\nArya apologizes to Ned profusely as she cries. Ned turns angrily to the king, demanding to know why Arya was not brought to him first. Queen Cersei bristles at his tone but Robert apologizes, explaining that he only wanted to finish the business quickly. Cersei then accuses Arya and [[Mycah]] of ambushing Joffrey with clubs while setting [[Nymeria]] to tear off his arm. When Joffrey affirms this, Arya calls him a liar.  After the king has listened to Arya\xe2\x80\x99s side of the story, Lord [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]] begins snickering and asks Joffrey how a skinny nine-year-old girl managed to disarm him with a broom handle. When Joffrey recounts a very different story, King Robert is exasperated.\n\nNed reminds the king that [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] was also present and has Sansa brought in to testify. However, Sansa\xe2\x80\x94torn between her family and her love for Joffrey\xe2\x80\x94claims she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t remember. This infuriates Arya, who lunges at Sansa. Cersei uses this as an example of how wild Arya is, and insists she wants Arya punished. King Robert, even more exasperated, orders Ned to discipline Arya while he will discipline Joffrey. Unsatisfied, Cersei demands that Nymeria be killed and offers 100 gold dragons for her pelt. However, since Nymeria has disappeared, Cersei demands the skin of the other direwolf. When Ned protests, Robert only responds that a direwolf is not a pet and that the girl would be happier with a dog.\n\nSansa finally realizes that they are talking about \'\'her\'\' [[Lady (direwolf)|direwolf]] and goes crying to Ned. In a final attempt to save the direwolf, Ned insists that the king execute the wolf himself but Robert only walks away. Ned refuses to let [[Ilyn Payne]] do the task. When Cersei voices suspicion about Ned\xe2\x80\x99s intentions, Ned replies that the direwolf is from [[the North]] and deserves better than a butcher.\n\nWith Sansa\xe2\x80\x99s cries in his ears, Ned goes to Lady. As he sits beside the wolf waiting for his [[Ice|sword]], Ned considers the names his children chose for their wolves and finds that Sansa chose a good name for her well-behaved wolf. After the deed is done, Ned commands four guardsmen to return Lady\xe2\x80\x99s body to [[Winterfell]] for burial, insisting that Cersei will never have her skin.\n\nAs he is returning, Sandor Clegane and his riders come back from the hunt. Clegane states that while they didn\xe2\x80\x99t find Arya they did find her pet and drops a corpse at Ned\xe2\x80\x99s feet. As he bends to uncover the corpse, Ned wonders how he will tell Arya.

Later, Maester [[Vyman]] shows her a letter from Lord [[Elwood Meadows]], the new castellan at [[Storm\'s End]]. The man does not make note of [[Edric Storm]], and she wonders again why [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] is so interested in the boy, thinking he might mean to use the boy\xe2\x80\x99s appearance as proof of [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]]\xe2\x80\x99s ill heritage. Catelyn is considering the nature of bastards and their fathers, and recalls [[Roose Bolton]]\xe2\x80\x99s recent missive where he calls his bastard, [[Ramsay Snow]], a boy of tainted blood and that he counts himself &quot;well rid of him&quot;. Bolton states that he hopes [[Robb Stark|Robb]] will weigh his capture of [[Harrenhal]] against the crimes of his bastard son.\n\nCatelyn is drawn away as fighting begins across the [[Trident#Red Fork|Red Fork]], yet each time Lord [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]\xe2\x80\x99s troops attempt to cross, [[Edmure Tully|Edmure]]\xe2\x80\x99s men repel them, raining arrows down upon them as they attempt to ford the river. Catelyn is unimpressed despite the victory her brother has won against one of the most famous battlefield commanders alive. She sends wine to [[Cleos Frey]], and then attempts to gain information from him, but the man knows little of use. All she learns is that Ser Cleos saw only [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] at court, and she looked drawn; Catelyn muses that either Cersei is keeping [[Arya Stark|Arya]] hidden for fear of what she might say or do, or her younger daughter is dead. Catelyn does consider [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] a man who might be trusted at his word, despite what has transpired between the two of them. She then learns the results of the great victory, that [[Leo Lefford]] has drowned, [[Gregor Clegane]] was badly wounded, and the great knight [[Lyle Crakehall|Strongboar]] taken captive. Yet despite the fact that they were winning, she is still afraid.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n\n* The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n* [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2012/01/re-read-catelyn-vi-medieval-warfare.html Analyses  and summary] in the course of a 10th reread by Slynt.\n* [http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/06/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-21 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 45]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Catelyn Tully]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Riverrun]]\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 45]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 46, Catelyn]]\n[[zh:\xe5\x88\x97\xe7\x8e\x8b\xe7\x9a\x84\xe7\xba\xb7\xe4\xba\x89-\xe7\xab\xa0\xe8\x8a\x82_45]]</text>\n      <sha1>4ifi7rzwuvgobdo5r9b0zx7qeu7fcqo</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 69</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>7034</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>168706</id>\n      <parentid>166649</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-07-15T12:54:14Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Nittanian</username>\n        <id>3504</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4570">{{Infobox Chapter ADwD\n| pov\t\t= [[Jon Snow]]\n| place         = [[Castle Black]]\n| title\t\t= Jon XIII\n| page\t\t= 899\n| previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 68|The Dragontamer]]\n| current\t= Jon XIII\n| next\t\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 70|The Queen\'s Hand]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 58|Jon XII]]\n| arc next\t= \n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:FileBetrayal at the Wall david nashIIII.png|[[Wun Wun]] dragging the corpse of [[Patrek of King\'s Mountain|Ser Patrek]] behind him. \xc2\xa9 FFG|thumb|250px|left]] \n[[Jon Snow|Jon]] means to lead men to [[Hardhome]] to rescue the [[wildlings]] and men of the [[Night\'s Watch]] trapped there. [[Selyse Florent|Queen Selyse]] and [[Melisandre]] discourage him, and want to leave them to their fate. However, Jon is determined to lead a rescue mission. \n\nWhile planning the mission with [[Tormund Giantsbane]], Jon receives a [[Bastard Letter|letter]] from [[Ramsay Bolton]]. Ramsay claims that [[Stannis Baratheon|King Stannis]] is dead after a seven day battle, that he captured [[Mance Rayder]] and flayed his spear wives, and that he wants [[Jeyne Poole|his bride]] back, along with [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]], [[Melisandre]], [[Val]], Mance\'s presumed son, and Queen Selyse and her daughter\n\nThis changes everything, and Jon decides to send the bulk of the Night\'s Watch to Hardhome with Tormund in command, while he will go to [[Winterfell]] himself and make Ramsay answer for his words. Jon knows that doing so will break his vow to not interfere in the wars of the  [[Seven Kingdoms]], so he is prepared to go alone. He asks if anyone will ride with him and he gets an overwhelming roar of support from most of the wildlings, though not from his Black Brothers - [[Othell Yarwyck|Yarwyck]] and [[Bowen Marsh]] leave the hall with their men.  Jon doesn\'t mind as he appears to have more than enough men to go with him and none of the Night\'s Watch will have to break their vows.\n\nWhen Jon is on his way to inform Queen Selyse, he hears the giant [[Wun Weg Wun Dar Wun|Wun Wun]] roar and a man scream. When he arrives, a bleeding Wun Wun is smashing dead [[Patrek of King\'s Mountain|Ser Patrek]] against a tower wall. Jon tries to calm the people who come \nrunning, when [[Wick Wittlestick]] slashes at Jon\'s throat with a dagger, just barely grazing him. While Jon is still trying to understand, Bowen Marsh and others plant daggers in him, all of them saying, \'\'&quot;For the Watch.&quot;\'\'\nBy the time the fourth dagger slashes him, Jon passes out.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n* [[Selyse Florent|Queen Selyse]]\n* [[Stannis Baratheon|King Stannis]]\n* [[Shireen Baratheon]]\n* [[Patchface]]\n* [[Axell Florent|Ser Axell Florent]]\n* [[Melisandre]]\n* [[Devan Seaworth]]\n* [[Malegorn of Redpool]]\n* [[Benethon Scales]]\n* [[Narbert Grandison]]\n* [[Patrek of King\'s Mountain]]\n* [[Dorden the Dour]]\n* [[Brus Buckler]]\n* [[Tormund|Tormund Giantsbane]]\n* [[Gerrick Kingsblood]] \n* [[Mance Rayder]]\n* [[Raymun Redbeard]]\n* [[Ygritte]]\n* Gerrick Kingsblood\'s three daughters\n* [[Val|Lady Val]]\n* [[Ghost]]\n* [[Borroq]] and his boar\n* [[Soren Shieldbreaker]]\n* [[Alys Karstark]]\n* The promised prince\n* [[Rattleshirt]]\n* [[Arya Stark]]\n* [[Leathers]]\n* [[Toregg|Toregg the Tall]]\n* [[Mother Mole]]\n* [[Monster|Little monster (Gilly\'s child)]] \n* [[Aemon Steelsong|Mance Rayder\'s child]] \n* [[Mully ]]\n* [[Fulk|Fulk the Flea]]\n* [[Mormont\'s raven]]  \n* [[Satin]]\n* [[Bowen Marsh]]\n* [[Othell Yarwyck]]\n* [[Morna White Mask]]\n* [[Brogg]]\n* [[Gavin|Gavin the Trader]]\n* [[Great Walrus]]\n* [[Howd Wanderer]]\n* [[Harle the Huntsman]]\n* [[Harle the Handsome]]\n* [[Doss|Blind Doss]]\n* [[Ygon Oldfather]] \n* [[Maester Aemon]]\n* [[Samwell Tarly]]\n* [[Qhorin Halfhand]]\n* [[Jeor Mormont|the Old Bear]]\n* [[Donal Noye]]\n* [[Wun Weg Wun Dar Wun|Wun Wun]]\n* [[Cregan Karstark]] \n* [[Clydas]]\n* [[Ramsay Bolton|Ramsay Snow/Bolton]]\n* [[Jeyne Poole]]\n* [[Rowan]]\n* [[Holly]]\n* [[Squirrel]]\n* [[Willow Witch-eye]]\n* [[Frenya]]\n* [[Myrtle]]\n* [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon Greyjoy/Reek]]\n* [[Reek|Reek/Heke]]\n* [[Robb Stark]]\n* [[Bran Stark]]\n* [[Rickon Stark]]\n* [[Sansa Stark]]\n* [[Lady (direwolf)]]\n* [[Hareth (Mole\'s Town)|Horse]]\n* [[Rory]]\n* [[Wick Whittlestick]]\n* [[Lew (Left Hand)|Left Hand Lew]]\n* [[Alf|Alf of Runnymudd]]\n* [[Gavin|Gavin the Trader]]\n}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 69]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Jon Snow]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Castle Black]]\n\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 69]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 70, Jon]]</text>\n      <sha1>9aa69lodtgjtum6v1vzc75phxmcsguq</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Feast for Crows-Chapter 23</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5668</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>173230</id>\n      <parentid>166951</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-09-09T20:40:57Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Nittanian</username>\n        <id>3504</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <minor/>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6067">{{Infobox Chapter AFfC\n| pov\t\t= [[Sansa Stark]]\n| title\t\t= Alayne I\n| place         = the [[Eyrie]]\n| page\t\t= 328\n| previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 22|Arya II]]\n| current\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 23|Alayne I]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 24|Cersei V]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 10|Sansa I]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 41|Alayne II]]\n}}\n   \n==Synopsis==   \n[[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] is now completely in the role of [[Alayne Stone]], and she has considerable influence in the [[Eyrie]]. On the balcony of her rooms in the [[Eyrie#Maiden\'s Tower|Maiden\'s Tower]], she surveys the armies of the [[Lords Declarant]] camped outside the [[Gates of the Moon]]. Lord [[Gilwood Hunter]] arrived first, and immediately blockaded supplies from reaching the Eyrie. Though they are not yet under siege, the situation looks dire from her standpoint. Lord [[Robert Arryn|Robert]], even more irritable than normal because there are no eggs or bacon, tells Alayne that he still hears [[Marillion]] singing every night. Alayne assures him that the bard is dead, although she has not seen the body, but she herself no longer hears singing. When [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] arrives, he informs them that the Lords Declarant are on their way up to the Eyrie for a parley. He tells Alayne that there will be eight of them, but he is only concerned about [[Lyn Corbray]]. We learn that Lyn fought against [[Jon Arryn]] at [[taking of Gulltown|Gulltown]] at the onset of [[Robert\'s Rebellion]], but later fought alongside him at the [[Battle of the Trident|Trident]], where he slew Prince [[Lewyn Martell]] of the [[Kingsguard]] and broke the Dornish line. While his [[Lyonel Corbray|elder brother]] supports Petyr\'s position as Lord Protector of the Vale, Ser Lyn has taken up with the Lords Declarant. Bearing the Valyrian sword [[Lady Forlorn]], Ser Lyn is a dangerous and unpredictable man, quick to demand a duel.\n\nThe Lords Declarant seek to defend Lord Robert and the Vale, but do not acknowledge the Lord Protector, naming him a false counselor who has been misruling the Vale. After Robert has another fit, Littlefinger suggests that Maester [[Colemon]] try giving him [[sweetsleep]], although the [[maester]] seems reticent to do so. Alayne tells her &quot;father&quot; that [[Yohn Royce]] will recognize her, having met her at [[Winterfell]] when [[Waymar Royce]] took the black, but Petyr explains that &quot;men see what they expect to see.&quot; She also asks him why he doesn\'t leave the Vale to take up his position as Lord of [[Harrenhal]]. Littlefinger is convinced the place is cursed, especially after what happened to [[Tywin Lannister]], [[Gregor Clegane]], and [[Vargo Hoat]]. Lady [[Shella Whent]] recently died without any heirs, claiming yet another family that once ruled at [[Harren Hoare|Black Harren]]\'s nightmare castle. When Alayne recommends that he give Harrenhal to Lord [[Walder Frey]], Petyr smiles and tells her he might, but he would really like to give it to [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]], although he might have to &quot;remove her from the game&quot; sooner than planned, unless she removes herself first.\n\nAlayne leads the Lords Declarant up to Petyr\'s solar, where he confounds them by saying that he would like to sign their declaration to weed out the false counselors. But Yohn Royce tells him they did not come to obtain his signature; they are here to remove Littlefinger and take Lord Robert to foster at [[Runestone]]. Petyr informs them that he plans to foster the sons of other lords here so that Robert will have boys his own age around. He also asks Lady [[Anya Waynwood]] to send [[Harrold Hardyng]] to the Eyrie as his ward, but the Lords scoff at this request. Littlefinger refuses their demand that he leave the Vale and turn over Robert, and after he calls their bluffs of violence, Lyn Corbray draws Lady Forlorn, but this enrages the other Lords Declarant, and Bronze Yohn tells the knight to up his steel, reminding him that they are guests. Corbray stalks off, but this has worked to Littlefinger\'s advantage, as he now turns hostile toward the Lords. Demanding that they lift their encampment and give him one year to set the Vale to rights or else he will willingly step down as Lord Protector, all the Lords except Yohn Royce agree, and Petyr emerges victorious in the parley.\n\nLater that night, after the Lords have departed, Alayne asks Petyr what he plans for the next year. Littlefinger continues his tutelage of Alayne in playing the game of thrones. He states that one or two of the older Lords may die over the course of the year, and Lord [[Gilwood Hunter]] may well be killed by his younger brother [[Harlan Hunter|Harlan]], who arranged old Lord [[Eon Hunter|Eon]]\'s death.&lt;ref&gt;Petyr\'s certainty is a strong indicator that he has spies in the Vale\'s other Houses, and may well have influenced Harlan previously. We learned in [[A Storm of Swords]], [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 80|Chapter 80]] that rumor has it that it was Gilwood who arranged his father Eon\'s death.&lt;/ref&gt; Petyr admits that he will never be able to sway Bronze Yohn, but when Alayne inquires about Ser Lyn,&lt;ref&gt;Her specific wording reveals that she deduced that Lyn Corbray is in Petyr\'s service, something that the Lords Declarant are not aware of.&lt;/ref&gt; he tells her that he can be bought &quot;with gold and boys and promises.&quot;\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References}}\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/05/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-feast-for-crows-part-16 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Feast for Crows, Part 16].

Jon thinks to himself that he hopes Alliser Thorne does come back, alive, as he is still a brother in the Night\'s Watch. Jon is also sending out two other rangings, one led by [[Jack Bulwer|Black Jack Bulwer]] and another by [[Kedge Whiteye]]. \n\nJon descends the Wall with [[Eddison Tollett|Dolorous Edd]], noting that he is receiving messages of need for more men from some of his commanders as more sightings of wildlings are being reported. He wonders where he is to find yet more men. He sees [[Emmett|Iron Emmett]] in the yard and asks to spar with three of his best men, telling them all to come at him at the same time. [[Rattleshirt]] sees them and tells Jon that he should fight a man and not boys and they begin to spar. Rattleshirt is getting the best of him, despite fighting with a larger greatsword and no shield. Eventually they lose their swords, roll, and the fight ends with Rattleshirt on top. He is dragged off and Jon remarks that Rattleshirt fought well.\n\nA raven arrives with a message&lt;ref&gt;[[Asha Greyjoy]] received what appears to be an identical message in [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 26|Chapter 26]], which would therefore appear to happen at almost the same time as this one. Both of them must therefore happen shortly after [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 20|Chapter 20]]&lt;/ref&gt; that Jon\'s half-sister [[Arya Stark|Arya]] is to marry [[Ramsay Snow|Ramsay Bolton]]. The others ask how old his sister is, and he replies that she is eleven and that he has no sisters, only brothers in the Night\'s Watch. Jon later remembers his sister and the sword [[Needle]] he once gave to her, wondering if she still has it.\n\nHe goes for a walk and sees [[Melisandre]], though at first he believes her to be [[Ygritte]]. Melisandre tells him that he should not worry over matters of the heart and that she sees that his sister will flee this marriage and ride towards them on a dying horse. She also foresees that three of the rangers sent out will die, and come back eyeless. As she is leaving she tells him that when the dead men return, he should take her hand and she will save his sister.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 28]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Jon Snow]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Castle Black]]\n\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 28]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 29, Jon]]</text>\n      <sha1>et1rm3t7yqqt35yb1veskufhon9vwdr</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Clash of Kings-Chapter 41</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5690</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166444</id>\n      <parentid>99122</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-23T20:54:02Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4097">{{Infobox Chapter ACfK\n| pov\t\t= [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n| place         = [[King\'s Landing]]\n| title\t\t= Tyrion IX\n| page\t\t= 430\n| previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 40|Daenerys III]] \n| current\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 41|Tyrion IX]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 42|Davos II]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 36|Tyrion VIII]]  \n| arc next\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 44|Tyrion X]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]], the royal family, and their retainers are at the docks to see Princess [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]] off to [[Dorne]]. Tyrion is sending [[Arys Oakheart]] with her as her sworn shield. Prince [[Doran Martell]] has promised to move his banners into the high passes once Myrcella is safely at [[Sunspear]]. \n\nTyrion knows one of [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]]\xe2\x80\x99s secrets, how she is consorting with the unsavory hedge knight [[Osmund Kettleblack]] and his brothers in order to raise her own force of sellswords. What the Queen doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know is that [[Bronn]] is matching every copper she gives the [[House Kettleblack|Kettleblacks]], thus Ser Osmund is really one of Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s men. On the ride back to [[Red Keep#Maegor\'s Holdfast|Maegor\'s Holdfast]], things get out of hand when someone in the crowd hits [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] in the face with dung, and the king sends [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]] to deal with the perpetrator. The crowd, frenzied due to the lack of food and the harsh living conditions, boils over and begins to trample the procession. Sensing what is about to happen, Tyrion screams for them to ride hard for the gates of the Holdfast. In the mad rush, several members are lost, and by the time Tyrion reaches the safety of the gates, their lives are in doubt. \n\nAs Joffrey is ranting about traitors and how they attacked him, Tyrion dismounts and slaps him so hard his crown flies off, and then shoves him to the ground, shouting, &quot;You set your dog on them! What did you imagine they would do?&quot; Tyrion commands Ser [[Boros Blount|Boros]] and Ser [[Meryn Trant|Meryn]] to return and find [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] and those missing, and when the two [[Kingsguard]] balk, Cersei begins to berate them as well for their cowardice. Sansa returns, saved by Sandor Clegane who is covered in blood. Meanwhile, a fire has broken out in the city, and Tyrion can see the fear in the Hound\'s eyes when he commands the men to go and put out the fire. \n\nLater, it is discovered that [[Preston Greenfield]], [[Aron Santagar]], and the [[High Septon (Fat One)|High Septon]] lost their lives; Lady [[Tanda Stokeworth|Tanda]]\xe2\x80\x99s daughter [[Lollys Stokeworth|Lollys]] is found alive, having been raped by fifty men outside a tanner\xe2\x80\x99s shop, and Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s cousin [[Tyrek Lannister|Tyrek]] is missing. Tyrion wants his cousin found, mostly because the boy\xe2\x80\x99s father [[Tygett Lannister|Tygett]] was always kind to Tyrion. He is dismayed to learn from [[Jacelyn Bywater]] that many of the [[City Watch of King\'s Landing|City Watch]] and the common folk consider Tyrion the problem in the city, and would revolt given the chance. Later, Bronn remarks, while [[Varys]] is in the room, that things would be a lot easier if [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] were king. Tyrion understands this as a hint that Bronn thinks Joffrey should be killed.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n\n*The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n*Summary and analyses of the chapter [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2012/01/re-read-tyrion-ix-wild-in-streets.html in the course of a 10th reread].\n* [http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/05/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-19 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 41]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Tyrion Lannister]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in King\'s Landing]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 41]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 42, Tyrion]]</text>\n      <sha1>3vfbnzqqgaym3lnn7t8gmcwe8faeegh</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Game of Thrones-Chapter 41</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6004</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>165984</id>\n      <parentid>122920</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-17T14:19:54Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5660">{{Infobox Chapter AGoT\n| pov\t\t= [[Jon Snow]]\n| place         = [[Castle Black]]\n| title\t\t= Jon V\n| page\t\t= 371\n| previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 40|Catelyn VII]]\n| current\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 41|Jon V]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 42|Tyrion VI]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 26|Jon IV]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 48|Jon VI]]\n}} __NOTOC__\n\nSer [[Alliser Thorne|Alliser]] announces that he is passing eight recruits, including [[Jon Snow|Jon]]. There is a celebration, but Jon realizes that [[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] will not survive without the others to protect him. Jon asks [[Maester]] [[Aemon Targaryen|Aemon]] to allow Sam to become his steward since he can read, write, and do sums.\n\n==Synopsis==    \nFive new recruits are being marched up the [[kingsroad]], so Ser [[Alliser Thorne|Alliser]] is passing eight boys on to the [[Lord Commander of the Night\'s Watch|Lord Commander]]: [[Todder]], [[Halder]], [[Grenn]], [[Dareon]], [[Albett]], [[Pypar]], [[Matthar]], and [[Jon Snow|Jon]]. He then tells the boys that some will now call them men, but they are fools to believe it and when winter comes they will die like flies. Then Ser Alliser leaves.\n\nThe recruits gather around and offer congratulations to those promoted. As the boys pass a celebratory wineskin around, Jon notices [[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] standing by himself and goes over to him. Sam proclaims that Jon will be first ranger someday, like [[Benjen Stark|his uncle]] \xe2\x80\x9cwas.\xe2\x80\x9d Jon corrects this to \xe2\x80\x9cis.\xe2\x80\x9d Halder interrupts to ask if Jon is going to drink the wine he is carrying. Then Pyp grabs the wineskin, and squirts it into Jon\xe2\x80\x99s face. Soon the ecstatic boys start a snowball fight and by the time Jon can break free, Sam has disappeared.\n\nThe promoted boys are treated to a marvelous feast that night to celebrate. The group discusses and jokes about their assignments: ranger, builder, woodsman, steward. They are all convinced that Jon, as the best swordsman and rider, will be a ranger, like his uncle \xe2\x80\x9cwas\xe2\x80\x9d the First Ranger. Jon corrects this to \xe2\x80\x9cis\xe2\x80\x9d once again before pushing his food away and leaving. Pyp follows and asks what is wrong. Jon explains that it is because Sam is not with them. Without them to protect him, Sam will be at the mercy of Ser Alliser. Pyp assures Jon that they did all they could for Sam, but that is not good enough for Jon. Jon goes for a long ride by himself.\n\nAs he rides he thinks about the world outside the [[Night\'s Watch]] and reminds himself that he has not yet sworn his vow. He thinks of all the places he has wanted to travel to and will never visit. He longs to go back to [[Winterfell]] to be with his half-brothers, but then remembers that Lady [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] will not welcome him. Jon decides that there is no place for him in Winterfell or [[King\'s Landing]], and remembers that not even his mother had a place for him. Whoever she was, his mother must be something dishonorable, otherwise why would Lord [[Eddard Stark|Eddard]] be too ashamed to speak of her? On the ride back Jon thinks about what he should do about Sam.\n\n[[File:Maester Aemon.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Maester Aemon - by Amok \xc2\xa9]]\n\nJon visits [[Maester]] [[Aemon Targaryen|Aemon]] despite the late hour. Aemon\xe2\x80\x99s stewards, [[Chett]] and [[Clydas]], considered the ugliest men in the Watch, meet him at the door. Chett insists that the maester is asleep and orders Jon to come back in the morning. Jon puts his foot in the door to prevent it closing, and refuses to leave since tomorrow will be too late. Chett goes to get the maester, while Jon goes to the library and starts a fire as instructed. \n\nWhen Maester Aemon arrives, he sits by the fire and assures Jon that a midnight visitor is a welcome diversion from the sleeplessness of old age. Jon asks that Sam be accepted as a sworn brother along with the others. Chett complains that it is no concern of the maester and Maester Aemon agrees that training is the responsibility of Ser Alliser. Jon continues on to explain about all he and the others have done to protect Sam. \n\nChett remains adamant that Ser Alliser will make a man of Sam or kill him trying. Jon replies that the Watch has need of every man and thus to kill one in futile training would be stupid. Recalling Maester [[Luwin]]\xe2\x80\x99s words about why a maester\xe2\x80\x99s chain is made of many kinds of metal, Jon declares that the Watch (like a kingdom) needs all sorts of skills and knowledge. Then Jon asks why Sam could not be a steward. As a steward, Chett objects that it is not easy work fit for cowards: they keep the Watch alive by hunting, farming, gather firewood, make clothing, and bring up supplies. Maester Aemon calmly names a number of steward duties and Jon has to admit that none of them suit Sam. Then Jon declares that there is one thing Sam can do better than anyone else: help Maester Aemon, since he can do sums, read, write, and is good with animals like the ravens. The maester considers this for a while and then tells Jon that he will think on it.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/08/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-21 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/042/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==    \n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 41]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Jon Snow]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Castle Black]]\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 41]]\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 42, Jon]]\n[[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\x94\xd0\xb6\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbd V]]</text>\n      <sha1>gdl8vvxwhlp4ni20de93ddiqnpz9ei1</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Game of Thrones-Chapter 17</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>3641</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>165960</id>\n      <parentid>117075</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-17T14:12:08Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5207">{{Infobox Chapter AGoT\n| pov\t\t= [[Bran Stark]]\n| place         = [[Winterfell]]\n| title\t\t= Bran III\n| page\t\t= \n| previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 16|Eddard III]]\n| current\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 17|Bran III]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 18|Catelyn III]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 8|Bran II]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 24|Bran IV]]\n}} __NOTOC__\n\nWhile in his coma, [[Bran Stark|Bran]] dreams of falling and of a crow teaching him to fly. Then he wakes to find himself crippled and decides to name his [[direwolf]] [[Summer (direwolf)|Summer]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:John Picacio Bran Stark.jpg|[[Bran]] dreaming of the [[three-eyed crow]] - \xc2\xa9 2012 John Picacio|thumb|200px|left]]\n\n[[Bran Stark|Bran]] is dreaming of falling; it seems that he has been falling for years. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I never fall,\xe2\x80\x9d he remembers as he falls. As the ground gets closer, Bran believes that he will wake up in the instant before he hits the ground, like he always has before. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if you don\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x9d asks a voice.\n\nA [[three-eyed crow|crow]] is with him, telling him to fly. Bran insists that he does not know how to fly. The crow asks him if he has ever tried. Bran then asks the crow if he is really a crow and the crow asks Bran if he is really falling. Bran begins to cry, but the crow insists the answer is flying not crying and that flying is easy. When Bran mentions that the crow has wings, the crow says maybe Bran does, too. When Bran searches himself for wings the crow tells him there are different kinds of wings. Bran asks the crow what he is doing and the crow responds that he is teaching Bran to fly. \n\nWhen Bran looks down again he can see the whole [[Seven Kingdoms|realm]] and everything in it. In [[Winterfell]] he sees the inhabitants going about their work and sees the [[heart tree]] in the [[godswood]] looking back at him. Bran sees his [[Catelyn Stark|mother]] contemplating a blood-stained knife aboard a [[Storm Dancer|ship]] sailing on the [[Narrow Sea]], and his [[Eddard Stark|father]] pleading with the [[Robert Baratheon|King]] near the [[Trident]]. He sees [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] crying herself to sleep and [[Arya Stark|Arya]] holding her secrets in her heart.\n\nAll around his family Bran sees shadows: One as dark as ash with the terrible face of a hound and another in armour as golden and beautiful as the sun. Over them all looms a giant armoured in stone, but with only darkness and black blood behind its visor.\n\nIn the far east, Bran sees dragons stirring in the fabled [[Shadow Lands]]. Bran turns north to [[the Wall]], where he sees [[Jon Snow|Jon]] sleeping alone and growing cold and hard. Then Bran looks [[beyond the Wall]], and beyond the curtain of light at the edge of the world, into what he calls the &quot;heart of winter&quot;. What he sees there makes him cry. The crow tells Bran that now he knows why he must live: because winter is coming.\n\nBran can see spires of ice rising up to impale him and the bodies of a thousand dreamers before him. The crow tells Bran that he must choose: fly or die. Bran spreads his arms and flies. The crow reacts by pecking at Bran\xe2\x80\x99s face between his eyes, blinding him.\n\nSuddenly, the crow dissolves into a serving woman with long black hair. Bran realizes he is in Winterfell. The serving woman drops her basin and runs down the steps shouting, \xe2\x80\x9cHe is awake.\xe2\x80\x9d Bran touches the burning space between his eyes where he was pecked but cannot feel a thing.\n\nBran\xe2\x80\x99s [[direwolf]] jumps up onto his legs, but Bran cannot feel it. When his brother [[Robb Stark|Robb]] arrives, Bran looks up calmly and says, \xe2\x80\x9cHis name is [[Summer (direwolf)|Summer]].\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Bran Stark]]\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Summer (direwolf)|Summer]]\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Arya Stark]]\n*[[Jon Snow]]\n*[[Sansa Stark]]\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]]\n*Maester [[Luwin]]\n*[[Hodor]]\n*[[Mikken]]\n|}\n\n==Terms and places mentioned==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[Winterfell]]\n*The [[Bite]]\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*The [[Trident]]\n*The [[Free Cities]]\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*The [[Dothraki Sea]]\n*[[Vaes Dothrak]]\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*The [[Jade Sea]]\n*[[Asshai|Asshai by the Shadows]] \n*[[The Wall]]\n|}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2009/05/eddard-bran.html Humorous review of the chapter]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/05/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-9 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/018/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 17]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Bran Stark|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 17]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Winterfell]]\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 17]]\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 18, Bran]]\n[[pt:A Guerra dos Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 17]]\n[[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\x91\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0\xd0\xbd III]]</text>\n      <sha1>nhyumclo1aj6uw8lfpojwt2votrvhln</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 33</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6857</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166572</id>\n      <parentid>166571</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-25T16:06:58Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2646">{{Infobox Chapter ADwD\n| pov\t\t= [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n| place         = the [[Summer Sea]]\n| title\t\t= Tyrion VIII\n| page\t\t= 434\n| previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 32|Reek III]]\n| current\t= Tyrion VIII\n| next\t\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 34|Bran III]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 27|Tyrion VII]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 40|Tyrion IX]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] is aboard the \'\'[[Selaesori Qhoran]]\'\',&lt;ref&gt;The name of the ship is a close translation of &quot;Stinky Seneschal&quot;, and therefore a possible reference to Quaithe\'s prophecy in [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 11|Chapter 11]]&lt;/ref&gt; a trading cog on the way to [[Qarth]]. He watches the evening prayer led by [[Moqorro]], a [[R\'hllor|red priest]] from the [[Summer Islands]] and [[Benerro]]\'s right hand. Tyrion ask Moqorro what he sees in the flames, to which he replies dragons, true and false, with Tyrion in the middle of it all.\n\nTyrion befriends [[Penny]], uneasily at first. He apologizes for what has happened to her brother [[Oppo]] and tells her it was not him that killed her brother but rather his sister [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]]. Regardless, she still blames Tyrion and barges off. Later, there is a terrible storm, following which Tyrion spies Penny again. She says that the storm frightened her and she thought she may have died. Penny tells Tyrion that she does not truly blame him for the death of Oppo.\n\nAfter their talks Penny spends more time up on the deck, whereas earlier she spent much of the time hiding away in her cabin. After that they began to spend more time together, Tyrion\'s witty playful attitude begins to cheer her up and he hears her laugh and act a lot more like the girl she is.\n\nThey then draw close to the coast of [[Valyria]]. Tyrion sees the fires of the [[Fourteen Fires]], he watches them and talks to Moqorro. As they draw closer Tyrion thinks about the prophecies and if they may be confused with multiple [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]]. Moqorro says that he has seen in his flames that there are others seeking [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]]. Tyrion asks Moqorro what else he has seen to which he replies that he sees only their shadows, but one most of all.

The [[battle of the Blackwater]] is underway and the people in the sept are waiting for the outcome. \n\n[[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] obliged her to see him off before. He made her kiss [[Hearteater|his sword]] promising that he would kill [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] with it. Sansa hopes that Joffrey will fight himself and get himself killed. She told him that her brother [[Robb Stark|Robb]] was always in the thick of the fight. Joffrey replied that he will kill Robb as well. \n\nIn the sept the people are singing. Sansa sings with them until they start praying for the victory of Joffrey. Silently Sansa prays for his defeat and goes away. As she leaves for Maegor\'s Holdfast she can hear the sound of battle. \n\nWithin the holdfast Sansa enters the Queen\'s Ballroom, where there is almost every highborn woman in the city, along with a handful of old men and young boys. Sansa notices [[Ilyn Payne]]. She asks Cersei why Ser Ilyn has come. Cersei explains why they need him:\n:::-\'\'&quot;When the axes smash down those doors, you may be glad of him.&quot;\'\'\n:::-\'\'&quot;Won\'t your guards protect us?&quot;\'\'\n:::-\'\'And who will protect us from my guards? The queen gave [[Osfryd Kettleblack|Osfryd]] a sideways look. &quot;Loyal sellswords are rare as virgin whores. If the battle is lost my guards will trip on those crimson cloaks in their haste to rip them off. They\'ll steal what they can and flee, along with the serving men, washer women, and stableboys, all out to save their own worthless hides. Do you have any notion what happens when a city is sacked, Sansa? No, you wouldn\'t, would you? All you know of life you learned from singers, and there\'s such a dearth of good sacking songs.&quot;\'\'\n:::-\'\'True knights would never harm women and children. The words rang hollow in her ears even as she said them.\'\'\n:::-\'\'True knights. The queen seemed to find that wonderfully amusing. &quot;No doubt you\'re right. So why don\'t you just eat your broth like a good girl and wait for [[Symeon Star-Eyes]] and Prince [[Aemon Targaryen|Aemon the Dragonknight]] to come rescue you, sweetling. I\'m sure it won\'t be very long now.&quot;\'\'\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n*[[Meryn Trant]]\n*[[Mandon Moore]]\n*[[Osmund Kettleblack]]\n\n| style=&quot;width:33%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n\n*[[Tanda Stokeworth]]\n*[[Lollys Stokeworth]]\n*[[Shae]], Lollys maid\n*[[Falyse Stokeworth]]\n*[[Ilyn Payne]]\n*[[Osfryd Kettleblack]]\n\n| style=&quot;width:33%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentionned\'\'\'\n*Septa [[Mordane]]\n*[[Stannis Baratheon]]\n*[[Arya Stark]]\n*[[Tommen Baratheon]]\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Rickon Stark]]\n*[[Catelyn Tully]]\n|}\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n* [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2012/01/re-read-sansa-v-chapter-of-songs.html Analyses and summary of the chapter] in the course of a 10th reread by Slynt.\n* [http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/07/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-28 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 57]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Sansa Stark|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 57]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 57]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 58, Sansa]]</text>\n      <sha1>fh1ex7idtvesv14unsgey3m9llly7uo</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Clash of Kings-Chapter 46</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6216</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166449</id>\n      <parentid>142913</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-23T20:54:28Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2365">{{Infobox Chapter ACfK\n| pov\t\t= [[Bran Stark]]\n| place         = [[Winterfell]]\n| title\t\t= Bran VI\n| page\t\t= 485\n| previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 45|Catelyn VI]]\n| current\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 46|Bran VI]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 47|Arya IX]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 35|Bran V]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 69|Bran VII]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Bran Stark|Bran]] is once again dreaming through the eyes of [[Summer]], who is alerted by a faint clink, and he and [[Shaggydog|his brother]] can smell something wrong in the air. The direwolf desperately tries to escape from the godswood, but the gate is locked, so tries to climb a tree to reach the wall, following Bran\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts. Summer falls from the tree, and Bran awakes with a sore shoulder to find a strange man in his room, followed by [[Theon Greyjoy]]. Theon, calling himself a prince, tells him that the castle is his now, that his [[ironmen]] swam the moat and unlocked the postern gate. His father\xe2\x80\x99s former ward informs him that he must make the people of [[Winterfell]] aware that Theon is in command, and that no one will be hurt if they concede. Bran watches as all those whom [[Jojen Reed|Jojen]] saw in his dream die, and all of the crannogman\xe2\x80\x99s words have come true. [[Capture of Winterfell|The sea has come to Winterfell]], and Mikken drowns on his own blood as he refuses to bend the knee.{{Ref|aCoK|35}} Most in the castle defy Theon, but [[Reek]] and [[Osha]] join his service. Bran is disappointed about the latter, but manages to convince the rest that fighting is not the answer.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n\n* The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n* [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2012/01/re-read-bran-vi-wolf-words-and-squids.html Analyses and summary of the chapter] in the course of a 10th reread by Slynt.\n* [http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/06/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-22 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 46]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Bran Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Winterfell]]\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 46]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 47, Bran]]</text>\n      <sha1>nni1bpnco9w7ppfr9fn821055dx8js4</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 47</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6884</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166640</id>\n      <parentid>166623</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-26T19:29:18Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3103">{{Infobox Chapter ADwD\n| pov\t\t= [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n| place         = [[Yunkai|Yunkish]] camp near [[Meereen]]\n| title\t\t= Tyrion X\n| page\t\t= 618\n| previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 46|A Ghost in Winterfell]]\n| current\t= Tyrion X\n| next\t\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 48|Jaime I]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 40|Tyrion IX]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 57|Tyrion XI]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\nAll remaining crewmen and passengers of the \'\'[[Selaesori Qhoran]]\'\' are sold into slavery in a [[Yunkai|Yunkish]] camp near [[Meereen]]. [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] and [[Penny]] are sold together to [[Yezzan zo Qaggaz]], an immensely fat Yunkish (though a [[Westeros|Westerosi]] sellsword tries hard to buy them-Tyrion suspects this is because the sellsword knows him and wants to claim [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei\'s]] bounty on his head) and put under the charge of his retainer called [[Nurse]]. \n\nTyrion sees [[Jorah Mormont]] brought on the auction block behind them. The knight tried to fight off the slavers and was beaten almost to the point of death, his face is so swollen as to be almost unrecognizable. Tyrion convinces Nurse that Mormont is an essential part of their show and needs to be bought too. Jorah fought bravely, killing three of the slavers, before being captured and beaten so severely.  The fight went out of him once he heard that [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] had wed [[Hizdahr zo Loraq]].{{Ref|aDwD|43}}\n\nOnce purchased, they are brought to Yezzan\'s pavilion, where they meet some of his other &quot;treasures&quot; and his most prized possession [[Sweets]], a hermaphrodite. They are also fitted with slave collars, which Tyrion does not mind as he observes that collars can be removed. There they find out that the sellsword who also tried to buy them was [[Brown Ben Plumm]] of the [[Second Sons]]. In the evening, Tyrion and Penny are summoned to perform a joust for the guests of Yezzan, including the Yunkish supreme commander [[Yurkhaz zo Yunzak]]. The joust is well received, following which they are to pour wine and water for the guests. One of the men heard Tyrion\'s boast of his skill at [[cyvasse]]. Tyrion plays against him and wins, angering the man. He also plays Ben Plumm as his master bets on him; he wins four of five matches, and earns much gold for his master.\n\nAs a reward for their great jousting performance, Yezzan announces they are to repeat it in the [[Daznak\'s Pit|Great Pit of Daznak]] in front of tens of thousands of people.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n* [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n* [[Illyrio]]\n* [[Penny]]\n* [[Jorah Mormont]]\n* [[Tywin Lannister]]\n* [[Cersei Lannister]]\n* [[Bronn]]\n* [[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n* [[Yezzan zo Qaggaz]]\n* [[Zahrina]]\n* [[Nurse]]\n* [[Sweets]]\n* [[Yurkhaz zo Yunzak]]\n* [[Brown Ben Plumm]]\n}}\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 47]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Tyrion Lannister]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Meereen]]\n\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 48, Tyrion]]</text>\n      <sha1>bs6s2au2j2p5g76n3w6x64d5dnc9kcb</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 10</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6816</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>184476</id>\n      <parentid>166541</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-05-26T07:32:36Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Dancing Maester</username>\n        <id>6281</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <comment>/* Synopsis */</comment>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2371">{{Infobox Chapter ADwD\n| pov\t\t= [[Jon Snow]]\n| place         = [[Castle Black]]\n| title\t\t= Jon III\n| page\t\t= 134\n| previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 9|Davos I]]\n| current\t= Jon III\n| next\t\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 11|Daenerys II]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 7|Jon II]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 17|Jon IV]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\nAt [[Castle Black]] [[Melisandre]] is preparing to burn [[Mance Rayder]] in a cage made out of wood from the [[haunted forest]], despite [[Jon Snow|Jon]]\'s pleas to King [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] to spare him.  At the sight of the cage, Mance\'s courage fails and he goes to his death begging for mercy, denying his kingship and his name and shrieking of witchcraft. Melisandre burns the [[Horn of Joramun]] as well, so that the Wall can never fall. As the cage burns Jon orders his bowmen to shoot Mance with arrows, a fitting end for a man of the [[Night\'s Watch]]. Melisandre proclaims to the assembled [[wildlings]] that Stannis is their true King, [[Azor Ahai]] reborn. Stannis draws [[Lightbringer]] which is blindingly bright, and promises all who serve him food, land and justice. The gates of the [[Wall]] are opened and most of the captive wildlings enter to kneel before Stannis, feeding the fire with fragments of [[weirwood]], pieces of the [[old gods]] to feed [[R\'hllor]]\'s fires. \n\n[[Bowen Marsh]] thinks it is wrong to let thousands of wildlings south of the Wall, and would prefer to seal the gates and let the wildlings defend the northern side. Many of the men of the Night\'s Watch are also muttering against the perception that Jon has taken Stannis\' side in the game of thrones. Jon denies this, but says that the outcome of the struggle is unclear following the death of [[Tywin Lannister]]. Jon shares a cup of wine with [[Clydas]], telling him that Maester [[Aemon Targaryen (son of Maekar I)|Aemon]] had shown him a passage in the \'\'[[Jade Compendium]]\'\' describing [[Lightbringer]] as both bright and fearfully hot. He notes that although Stannis\'s sword radiates light, it produces no heat.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 10]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Jon Snow]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Castle Black]]\n\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 10]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 11, Jon]]</text>\n      <sha1>2l0k967qic2o9ylhffxp51pwwkxknbo</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Game of Thrones-Chapter 56</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6016</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>177779</id>\n      <parentid>177097</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-12-23T15:50:10Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Nittanian</username>\n        <id>3504</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8143">{{Infobox Chapter AGoT\n| pov\t\t= [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n| place         = [[inn at the crossroads]]\n| title\t\t= Tyrion VII\n| page\t\t= 507\n| previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 55|Catelyn VIII]]\n| current\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 56|Tyrion VII]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 57|Sansa V]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 42|Tyrion VI]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 62|Tyrion VIII]]\n}} __NOTOC__\n\n[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] meets [[Tywin Lannister|his father\xe2\x80\x99s]] army at the [[inn at the crossroads]], escorted by 300 [[Vale mountain clans]]men. Tyrion and Lord Tywin are discussing their war plans when Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s clansmen burst in, but Tywin handles them coolly. When news arrives that [[Robb Stark]]\xe2\x80\x99s host is advancing, Tywin offers rich rewards to the clansmen if they fight for him.\n\n==Synopsis==    \n[[Chella]] of the [[Black Ears]] is the one who locates [[Tywin Lannister|Lord Tywin]]\xe2\x80\x99s army, which she deduces to be 20,000 men. [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] has gathered a force of over 300 [[Vale mountain clans|mountain clans]]men and [[Gunthor son of Gurn]] is collecting more. He wonders what his father will make of his little army, since he is not sure what to make of them himself.\n\nTyrion wants to meet his father without the clansmen, but [[Ulf son of Umar]] expresses distrust and [[Shagga]] insists that he will go with the \xe2\x80\x9cboyman,\xe2\x80\x9d and if he lies Tyrion will lose his manhood. Tyrion is forced to quickly give in to the demands of his captor-followers (he\xe2\x80\x99s still not sure which they are) and selects representatives from each clan to accompany him. As a parting jibe, he asks the remaining clansmen to try not to kill each other while he is gone. Tyrion dislikes having to work with the clans because they think everyone\xe2\x80\x99s voice should be heard in council, which causes them to argue endlessly.\n\nWhen they come to the first strongpoint, which Tyrion approaches alone, the captain recognizes Tyrion and gives them an escort. They travel past burned land and buildings. There are many carrion birds, although there are no bodies. When they arrive at the guarded camp containing hundreds of campfires, they are met by a party led by Ser [[Flement Brax]], who is surprised to see Tyrion. He tells Tyrion that his father has taken the [[inn at the crossroads]] as his headquarters, which Tyrion finds a fitting full-circle to his [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 28|unpleasant abduction]]. \n\nAs they pass the many banners, Tyrion guesses that Chella\xe2\x80\x99s count cannnot be far wrong. He also notes that his clansmen are awed, which pleases him; the more impressed they are by the power of [[House Lannister]] the easier they will be to control. When they arrive at the inn, Tyrion is pleased to see the body of the innkeepter [[Masha Heddle]] rotting in a gibbet. When the stableboys emerge hesitantly to take their horses, Shagga is suspicious but Tyrion is able to convince him. House guards at the door direct Tyrion to his father in the common room.\n\nLord Tywin Lannister is sharing ale with his brother, Ser [[Kevan Lannister]]. Kevan sees Tyrion first and expresses surprise, but Tywin only remarks that the rumors of his demise were unfounded. Tyrion tells his father that he is sorry to disappoint him, feeling uncomfortable with his deformities under his father\xe2\x80\x99s gaze. He quickly covers his discomfort with a quip that he is thankful they started a war for his sake. His father takes the opportunity to chastise Tyrion for going meekly with [[Catelyn Stark|a woman]]; his brother [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] would not have gone without a fight. Tyrion replies that Jaime is also taller. \n\n[[File:MagaliVilleneuve TywinLannister.jpg|left|300px|thumb|Lord Tywin Lannister of Casterly Rock]]\n\nLord Tywin then explains that Lannister honor demanded they go to war after Tyrion was captured. Tyrion asks them how that [[War of the Five Kings#War in the Riverlands|war]] is going. His father explains that Jaime has been covering himself in glory, [[battle in the hills below the Golden Tooth|smashing]] the forces of Lords [[Clement Piper|Piper]] and [[House Vance of Wayfarer\'s Rest|Vance]] at the [[Golden Tooth]] and pushing on to [[battle under the walls of Riverrun|defeat]] the main [[House Tully|Tully]] forces outside [[Riverrun]] and capture [[Edmure Tully]]. Lord [[Tytos Blackwood|Blackwood]] has fallen back to hold Riverrun against Jaime, but the other [[riverlands|river lords]] have dispersed to their own lands. Many of these lords have now fallen one by one to Lord Tywin\xe2\x80\x99s army, leaving only the [[House Frey|Freys]] and [[House Mallister|Mallisters]] to oppose them. Lord Tywin in not concerned; he knows that [[Walder Frey]] will not bestir himself until the winner is clear and [[Jason Mallister]] lacks the strength to stand alone. The only real threat is that the [[House Stark|Starks]] or [[House Arryn|Arryns]] will interfere.\n\nTyrion tells them they need not worry about the Arryns, but the Starks are another matter. He is informed of [[Eddard Stark]]\xe2\x80\x99s arrest and that [[Robb Stark]] has called the Stark banners. Tywin remains unperturbed, declaring that Robb is only a child. When Tyrion questions how [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] has convinced King [[Robert I Baratheon|Robert]] to imprison his dear friend Ned, he learns that the king is dead and [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] now reigns. Tyrion immediately understands that his sister is the true ruler and knows that things will be very different.\n\nTyrion is then offered a command in the army: he is to handle [[Marq Piper]] and [[Karyl Vance]], who have been raiding Jaime\xe2\x80\x99s supply trains across the [[Red Fork]], and [[Beric Dondarrion]], who has been harassing Tywin\xe2\x80\x99s forging parties. Tyrion is not impressed with this command of perhaps 20 men, so he reveals to his father he has a promise to keep: weapons and armor for 3,000 clansmen and wagons to carry them. \n\nThen the door opens with a crash as the Captain of the Guard flies across the room. Shagga stamps in, followed by the other clansmen. Lord Tywin coolly asks who they are and Tyrion explains that they followed him and he wants to keep them. The clansmen insist that free men have the right to sit on war councils. Once Tyrion has introduced the clansmen, he introduces his father, complete with all his titles. Lord Tywin claims that even in the [[westerlands]] they have heard of the prowess of the mountain clans, and asks what brings them here. The reply is horses, silk, and steel. \n\nIt is then that news arrives that Robb Stark\xe2\x80\x99s host is coming down the [[kingsroad]]. Lord Tywin is pleased that he will be given such an easy chance to defeat House Stark so he can turn his attention towards [[Stannis Baratheon]]. He gives orders that Ser [[Addam Marbrand]] fall back to draw the northerners further south, harassing them along the way. After ordering the army assembled, Tywin compliments the clansmen\xe2\x80\x99s fearless reputation and promises that if they fight for him he will provide them with all that Tyrion promised them and more. The clansmen insist that they are being promised what is already owed. Tywin quickly covers by claiming that his words were a courtesy and that his boldest knights fear to face the northerners. [[Timett]] takes the bait and declares that the [[Burned Men]] fear nothing. With the Burned Men agreeing, all the other clans agree, but only if Tyrion accompanies them into battle until the promises he made them are honored.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/10/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-27 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/057/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 56]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Tyrion Lannister]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place by the Trident]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Crossroads Inn]]\n\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 57, Tyrion]][[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\xa2\xd0\xb8\xd1\x80\xd0\xb8\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbd VII]]</text>\n      <sha1>bonoblzp2op0be1v4a906vug7iapnp1</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Clash of Kings-Chapter 69</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5747</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166472</id>\n      <parentid>95742</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-23T21:02:02Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3264">{{Infobox Chapter ACfK\n| pov\t\t= [[Bran Stark]]\n| place         = [[Winterfell]]\n| title\t\t= Bran VII\n| page\t\t= 699\n| previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 68|Jon VIII]]\n| current\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 69|Bran VII]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Appendix|Appendix]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 46|Bran VI]]\n| arc next\t=\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Jojen Reed|Jojen]] wakes [[Bran Stark|Bran]] from a wolf dream, and warns him that he\'s spending too much time as [[Summer (direwolf)|Summer]], and that while the wolf eats in the dreams, Bran does not.

Trusting Bran\xe2\x80\x99s vision, they decide it is now safe to come out of hiding. [[Hodor]] moves a massive stone blocking off the door out of the crypts, and they indeed find Winterfell in ashes. They find several of [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]]\xe2\x80\x99s ironmen dead, along with men bearing the badge of the [[Dreadfort]].\n\nThe direwolves rejoin them, and lead them to Maester [[Luwin]] who lies near death in the godswood, which is still largely untouched.

As Bran looks upon Winterfell for perhaps the last time, he thinks to himself, The stone is strong, the roots of the trees go deep, and under the ground the [[King In The North|Kings of Winter]] sit their thrones.

After an official call for all the noble houses to pledge their fealty, the [[small council]] announces a number of new appointments. When he is dismissed from the [[Kingsguard]], Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] storms out. In his place, [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]] is appointed to the Kingsguard. Finally, Sansa comes forward to ask for leniency for [[Eddard Stark|her father]], and it is agree that mercy will be granted if he confesses and names Joffrey the true king.\n\n==Synopsis==    \n[[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] attends King [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]]\xe2\x80\x99s first court session. As a reward for being good and promising not to leave the [[Red Keep]], Sansa has been granted freedom of the castle by Queen [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]]. However, even Sansa realizes that it is an empty honor since she cannot get past the guards in any case, and has nowhere to go if she did. In addition, the queen has attached an \xe2\x80\x9chonor guard\xe2\x80\x9d to accompany Sansa everywhere.\n\nThe throne room has been stripped of all the hunting tapestries that King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] loved so well. Sansa also notes that there are no smallfolk and only perhaps twenty of the hundred lords accustomed to wait on King Robert. Sansa wonders where the others have all gone. As she passes among them, many of the men pretend not to know her and none will meet her eyes.\n\nJoffrey and Cersei are announced by a herald and enter escorted by members of the [[Kingsguard]]. Once he is seated on the [[Iron Throne]], Joffrey declares that it is a king\xe2\x80\x99s duty to punish the disloyal and reward the faithful and asks [[Grand Maester]] [[Pycelle]] to read his royal decrees. The list of those that must present themselves to swear fealty goes on for a long time. Finally, near the end, the names of Sansa\xe2\x80\x99s own [[House Stark|family]] are called, even down to [[Arya Stark|Arya]] and [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]]. The naming of Arya suggests to Sansa that her sister must have escaped and be safe in [[Winterfell]].\n\nIt is then announced that the king\xe2\x80\x99s grandfather, Lord [[Tywin Lannister]] is to take up the office of [[Hand of the King]] in place of the traitor [[Eddard Stark]]. It is also decreed that Cersei Lannister, as Queen Regent, be seated on the [[small council]] in place of [[Stannis Baratheon]] and that [[Janos Slynt]], Commander of the [[City Watch of King\'s Landing]], be raised to the rank of Lord and granted the ancient seat of [[Harrenhal]] as well as a seat on the small council. Janos Slynt then enters the hall, displaying his new [[House Slynt|lordly sigil]], to take his seat at the council table. The elevation of Slynt, a butcher\xe2\x80\x99s son, to the lordship of Harrenhal visibly angers many of the knights and lords present. Finally, Pycelle reads a decree that, in these times of turmoil, the council considers the safety of King Joffrey to be of paramount importance.\n\nQueen Cersei stands and calls forth Ser [[Barristan Selmy]]. She proceeds to thank the old knight for his many years of service in the Kingsguard, but declares that the time has come for him to set aside his burden. Ser Barristan is confused until the new-made Lord Slynt explains bluntly that he is being relieved as [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard]]. Ser Barristan is plainly stunned and protests that only death may relieve a Kingsguard of his sacred trust. Cersei asks whose death: his or his king\xe2\x80\x99s. Joffrey goes even further, accusing Ser Barristan of letting his father die and declaring him too old to protect anyone.\n\nSer Barristan reminds them that he has long ago forsaken his [[House Selmy|ancestral lands]] and [[Harvest Hall|keep]] and a wife-to-be in order to serve in the Kingsguard. He goes on to recount his history as a member of the Kingsguard, protecting and serving three kings. [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] notes that all three of these kings are dead. Then Cersei reiterates that Ser Barristan\xe2\x80\x99s time is done because Joffrey needs young and strong men around him, and that Ser [[Jaime Lannister]] will succeed him as Lord Commander. Ser Barristan is outraged that a man who killed the king he swore to protect should be made the Lord Commander.\n\n[[Varys]] attempts to calm the situation, insisting that they are not ungrateful to Ser Barristan and that Lord Tywin Lannister has agreed to grant Ser Barristan a tract of land in the [[Westerlands]] with men and gold sufficient to build a stout keep and servants to see to his every need. Ser Barristan venomously describes such a gift as a hall to die in and men to bury him. He removes his white cloak and armor and drops them on the floor, declaring that he will die a knight. Littlefinger quips \xe2\x80\x9cA naked knight, it would seem,\xe2\x80\x9d which raises laughs from the entire hall, even the remaining members of the Kingsguard. \n\nThe laughter ends abruptly when Ser Barristan draws his sword, but the old knight insists they should have no fear, even though he could still cut down the remaining five Kingsguard with ease. He adds in disgust that any man who would serve under the Kingslayer does not deserve the white cloak. Then he throws his sword at the foot of the Iron Throne, declaring to Joffrey, \xe2\x80\x9cHere, boy. Melt it down and add it to the others.\xe2\x80\x9d Before he leaves, the old knight suggests that perhaps [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] will depose Joffrey and sit upon the throne. The knight\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps echo through the hall as he takes the long way out.\n\nJoffrey is incensed at Ser Barristan\xe2\x80\x99s talk of Stannis and at being called a boy. He orders Ser Barristan seized and questioned. Finally, Janos Slynt announces that his gold cloaks will see to it. It is then announced that [[Sandor Clegane]] will fill the vacancy created by the departure of Ser Barristan. Joffrey asks the Hound what he thinks, and Clegane declares that he has no lands or wife to forsake, but that he will not take a knight\xe2\x80\x99s vows. Ser [[Boros Blount]] of the Kingsguard protests that the members of the Kingsguard have always been anointed knights, but is quickly rebuffed.\n\n[[File:Sansa Stark HBO.jpg|310px|left|thumb|Sansa pleads for her father\'s life.]]\n\nThe time has finally come for Sansa when she hears the herald ask for any further business. She nervously comes forward, thinking that she must be as strong as her [[Catelyn Stark|lady mother]]. She calls out and Joffrey, seeing her, tells her to come forward, which emboldens her. She begs mercy for her father. Queen Cersei expresses displeasure, but Varys only claims that she is a child who does not understand what she says. Joffrey tells the others to let her speak. \n\nThe small council questions her about her father\xe2\x80\x99s treason, and Sansa knows better than to deny it. Instead she tells them that others must have lied to her father, and that he only claimed Joffrey was not the king because of the pain from his broken leg and the effects of the [[milk of the poppy]]. Joffrey calls for his mother, who states that if Lord Eddard confesses his crime, then they will know he has repented. Sansa prays that her Joffrey be as kind and noble as she believes he is. Joffrey agrees that if Eddard admits his guilt and swears fealty he will be granted mercy. Sansa assures them that he will.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/10/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-28 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/058/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 57]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Sansa Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 57]]\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 58, Sansa]]\n[[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\xa1\xd0\xb0\xd0\xbd\xd1\x81\xd0\xb0 V]]</text>\n      <sha1>kd26adfk0nznloc4i6mnokzjqjuqz4e</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Clash of Kings-Chapter 19</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6152</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>197708</id>\n      <parentid>168737</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2017-02-27T18:16:20Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>WardofWinterfell</username>\n        <id>7193</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10451">{{Infobox Chapter ACfK\n| pov\t\t= [[Arya Stark]]\n| place         = Village west of the [[Gods Eye]]\n| title\t\t= Arya V\n| page\t\t= 212\n| previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 18|Sansa II]]\n| current\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 19|Arya V]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 20|Tyrion V]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 14|Arya IV]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 26|Arya VI]]\n}}\n\nOn their way to scout a village, [[Gendry]] unmasks [[Arya Stark|Arya]] as a girl, forcing her to reveal her true identity. The village turns out to be occupied by Ser [[Gregor Clegane]] and his [[The Mountain\'s men|men]], and Gendry is captured. During a rescue attempt, [[Hot Pie]] panics, leading to Arya\'s capture as well. Later, [[Rafford|a spearman]] kills [[Lommy]] rather than carry him.\n\n==Synopsis==\nFrom high in a tree, Arya can see a fishing village with some smoking chimneys. It is the first sign of life since they fled the [[Gods Eye town|holdfast]]; the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] have burned or killed everything. The houses promise warmth and shelter, unless it is Ser [[Amory Lorch]] there. Arya watches for a long time, trying to be sure, but it is too far to see for certain.\n\nArya and the others waited until the next night to return to the burnt village. [[Hot Pie]] and [[Lommy]] were still afraid, but Lorch and his men were long gone. The holdfast was strewn with corpses from both sides, and scavengers had been at them. One look was enough for [[Gendry]], but Arya insisted they find [[Yoren]], telling herself he could not be dead. They found his body next to four Lannister men-at-arms, and Arya wondered how many men it took to bring the black brother down. There were too many bodies to bury everyone, but Arya insisted Yoren must have a grave, and as they dug part of her wanted to cry and part of her wanted to kick Yoren.\n\nThe only other survivors were [[Cutjack]], [[Kurz]], and [[Tarber]], who had been on look-out in the towerhouse. They came under attack as well, but the stone tower was inflammable and inaccessible with the ladder pulled up, so Lorch\'s men left them. When Kurz decided they would do better continuing north, Arya clung to the hope of still reaching [[Winterfell]], but Kurz took an arrow in the shoulder pulling up the towerhouse ladder and, despite Tarber treating it with mud and moss, the wound festered and killed him. Soon after, Tarber and Cutjack had taken the dead poacher\'s weapons and hunting horn when they abandoned them. Afterward, wanting no part of any roads, Arya and the others made their way up the muddy shore of [[God\'s Eye]], taking turns carrying Lommy on a makeshift litter, since the spear wound in his calf is now so bad he cannot walk.\n\nFrom her tree, Arya sees that the air over the village is full of crows, but thirty yards from shore three black swans glide serenely over the water, oblivious to the war. Part of Arya wants to be one of them, but the other part wants to eat one. She and the others have been living mostly on an awful-tasting acorn paste Kurz taught them to make, though Arya and [[Weasel]] (their new name for the crying girl) have also been eating bugs and worms. Arya even tried catching fish with her hands as [[Koss]] once did, but without success.\n\nBeneath Arya\'s tree, Hot Pie barks like a dog to signal her, an old poacher\'s trick Kurz taught them. With the nimbleness of a [[water dancer]], Arya returns to the ground to report her findings. Hot Pie opines that they should go to the village and ask for food, convinced they will not be killed if they yield. Gendry accuses him of sounding like Lommy, who has talked of little else since they escaped from the holdfast. Lommy and Hot Pie insist Lorch would have left them alone if Yoren had yielded, but Gendry points out that knights and lordlings only take each other captive and do not care about the lower classes. \n\nHot Pie and Lommy start talking about searching for dead fish, cooking crows, and even hunting boars (which Arya knows they cannot do without boar spears, horses, and men) until Gendry proposes they steal food from the village after he scouts it out. Arya argues that she should go instead because she is stealthier, but Gendry only agrees that she can come with him. Hot Pie and Lommy worry about being left for the wolves, and Lommy whines that they should yield to whomever they find because he needs some potion for his wounded leg. Gendry reminds them that Lommy has a spear for the wolves and promises to bring back any leg potion they find, then dons his bull helm and walks off.\n\nDuring their walk, Gendry stops and says he thinks Lommy is going to die. Arya is not surprised since she has felt Lommy\'s warm skin and smelled the stink off his leg. She suggests finding a [[maester]], but Gendry dismisses it as unlikely. He suggests they should abandon Lommy, since Lommy would do the same and he is sick of Lommy\'s talk of yielding, adding that Arya is the only one who\'s good for anything, even if she is a girl. Arya panics and insists she is not a girl, but Gendry insists he is not stupid and to prove him wrong she will have to pull out her cock. Desperate to escape the subject, Arya brings up the gold cloaks at the inn and says Gendry is also hiding something. Gendry insists he does not know why they wanted him and turns the question back on Arya, asking why she thought they were after her. \n\nRealizing her pretense is done, Arya decides she must kill Gendry or trust him and, after pleading that Lommy and Hot Pie cannot know, she admits she is Arya of [[House Stark]]. Gendry is so shocked by the revelation that Arya is a highborn lady that he becomes unsure how to act around her and begins calling her &quot;m\'lady&quot; and begging her pardon for talking about cocks and for pissing in front of her. Unsure if he is mocking her, Arya orders him to stop it, since even Hot Pie will notice if he starts calling her that. When Gendry responds by calling her &quot;m\'lady&quot; again, Arya slams into his chest and he falls down, laughing. Then she gives him a kick in the side (which only makes him laugh harder) and sets off for the village, leaving Gendry to hurry after.\n\nAs they approach the village, they smell rotting flesh. Gendry decides to circle around to the west while Arya continues up the shore, slipping from bush to bush and stopping every few yards to listen. The smell gets worse as she gets closer and she begins to hear horses and men. Squirming through a gap in a bramble thicket on the edge of the village, Arya discovers a long gibbet full of corpses so decayed they hardly look like people. Arya forces herself to look at each one in turn, telling herself she is hard as a stone. Beyond the gibbet, two spearmen guard the doors of the slate-roofed warehouse by the water. Arya cannot make out the two limp banners nearby, but she knows the dead men must mean Lannisters.\n\n[[File:Gregor Clegane Nordheimer.jpg|thumb|280px|left|Ser Gregor Clegane and his men - by Nordheimer\xc2\xa9]]\n\nThe two guards turn toward a shout from a third man, who appears shoving along a prisoner Arya recognizes as Gendry by his bull helm. One of the guards snatches Gendry\'s helm and, after beating him around a little, they shove him through the heavy doors of the storehouse. From inside Arya hears sobbing and a loud shriek of pain. Then the wind flutters the banners and she makes out Lannister lion and three black dogs on a yellow field that she feels she should remember.\n\nArya watches for hours as the armored men come and go, as dinner is prepared, and as night falls, but she does not see an opportunity to free Gendry. Late at night she returns to the others to insist Hot Pie help her free Gendry. Hot Pie insists they cannot fight twenty soldiers, but Arya argues they will only have to kill the two guards at the storehouse. Lommy suggests they should yield or just leave Gendry, but Arya points out they need his to help carry Lommy. When Arya insists she is going back to try, Hot Pie reluctantly agrees to come along. \n\nAs they are crawling along under the gibbet, a crow lands on Hot Pie\'s back and the guards hear his gasp. Hot Pie immediately leaps up and shouts out that he yields. By the time Arya bounces up and draws [[Needle]], they are surrounded. She slashes at the nearest man, but he blocks her with a steel-clad arm and someone else knocks her to the ground. A third man wrenches Needle away and punches her with a armored fist when she tries to bite him. Disoriented, Arya lies hurting and shamed by the loss of Needle, which [[Jon Snow]] gave her and [[Syrio Forel]] taught her to use.\n\nWhen she is yanked to her knees, Arya finds herself facing the biggest man she has ever seen, and suddenly she remembers the banner with the three dogs: at the [[Hand\'s tourney]], Sansa told her it was the banner of [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]]\'s brother, Ser [[Gregor Clegane]], the Mountain that Rides, who is even bigger than [[Hodor]]. After Hot Pie yields some more and tells him about Lommy and Weasel, Ser Gregor orders them to lead his men there and walks off. As they walk back to where Lommy and Weasel are hiding, Hot Pie promises to make pies and tarts for the four soldiers if they do not hurt him. \n\nWhen they arrive, Lommy immediately yields and explains that Weasel ran off when she heard them coming. The soldiers ask Lommy where they can find [[Beric Dondarrion]], but Lommy has never heard the name. One of the guards declares it a waste of time, since Arya\'s group do not know any more than the villagers. [[Rafford|A spearman]] drifts over to Lommy and asks if he can walk.

Although Stannis has vacated [[Jeor Mormont|Mormont]]\'s former chambers in King\'s Tower, Jon does not move in, knowing that others may misconstrue the move as a sign that he does not expect Stannis to return. \n\nAgainst [[Bowen Marsh]]\'s wishes, Jon accompanies a line of wagons under armed escort to deliver food to the [[wildling]]s who have taken refuge underground at [[Mole\'s Town]]. As they notice several faces carved into various trees along the road, he comes to realize that the wildlings may have bent the knee to Stannis and feigned to embrace the [[Lord of Light]], but in their hearts they will never abandon the [[old gods]]. \n\nA riot nearly breaks out as Jon\'s men deliver rations to the wildlings, with many complaining about the small amount of food they receive. Jon promises the wildings adequate food, shelter, and weapons if they help the [[Night\'s Watch]] defend the Wall, informing them that they have the choice: work with the Watch, or face the [[Others]] alone. In spite of their misgivings, many wildlings agree to join, children, [[spearwife|spearwives]], and fighters alike, including [[Halleck]], the brother of [[Harma|Harma Dogshead]]. However, [[Sigorn]] and the rest of the Thenns refuse the offer. When the rations are all distributed, the wagons are loaded with 63 wildings heading back to the Wall. Jon remembers something [[Mance Rayder]] told him, that the wildlings do not follow names or sigils. They follow strength.\n\n==Character list==\n\n{{columns|5|\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Jon Snow]]\n*[[Dolorous Edd]]\n*[[Iron Emmett]]\n*[[Hop-Robin]]\n*[[Ty]]\n*[[Ghost]]\n*[[Bowen Marsh]]\n*[[Halleck]]\n*[[Hairy Hal]]\n*[[Rory]]\n*[[Sigorn]]\n*[[Butts]]\n\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Samwell Tarly]]\n*[[Maester Aemon]]\n*[[Cotter Pyke]]\n*[[Stannis Baratheon]]\n*[[Gilly]]\n*[[Wildling prince]]\n*[[Hobb]]\n*[[Jeor Mormont]]\n*[[Clydas]]\n*[[Othell Yarwyck]]\n*[[Qhorin Halfhand]]\n*[[Donal Noye]]\n*[[Jarmen Buckwell]]\n*[[Benjen Stark]]\n*[[Melisandre]]\n*[[Mance Rayder]]\n*[[Justin Massey]]\n*[[Harwood Fell]]\n*[[Harma]]\n*[[Val]]\n*[[Styr]]\n*[[Arya Stark]]\n*[[Ygritte]]\n*[[Tormund Giantsbane]]\n*[[Weeper]]\n}}\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{columns|7|\n*[[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]]\n*[[Storm Crow]]\n*[[Skagos]]\n*[[Blackbird]]\n*[[King\'s Tower]]\n*[[Castle Black]]\n*[[Lord Commander\'s Tower]]\n*[[Hardin\'s Tower]]\n*[[Longclaw]]\n*[[Lord Commander of the Night\'s Watch]]\n*[[Lord Steward]] of the Night\'s Watch\n*[[Shadow Tower]]\n*[[Greyguard]]\n*[[Icemark]]\n*[[the Wall]]\n*[[Bridge of Skulls]]\n*[[First Ranger]] of the Night\'s Watch\n*[[Mole\'s Town]]\n*[[kingsroad]]\n*[[wildlings]]\n*[[King-Beyond-the-Wall]]\n*[[First Men]]\n*[[Children of the Forest]]\n*[[Magnar]]\n*[[Night\'s Watch]]\n*[[Thenn (people)|Thenns]]\n*[[Hornfoot]]\n*[[Free folk]]\n*[[Old Tongue]]\n*[[Common Tongue]]\n*[[White Walkers]]\n*[[House Lannister]]\n*[[Winterfell]]\n*[[old gods]]\n*[[the North]]\n*[[R\'hllor]]\n*[[The Seven]]\n*[[Seven Kingdoms]]\n}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 21]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Jon Snow]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Castle Black]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Mole\'s Town]]\n\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 21]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 22, Jon]]</text>\n      <sha1>2859cdceki5gf9dg2kxwwmk9cnye0rv</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Feast for Crows-Chapter 8</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5743</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166940</id>\n      <parentid>122085</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-06-05T18:20:07Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3353">{{Infobox Chapter AFfC\n| pov\t\t= [[Jaime Lannister]]\n| title\t\t= Jaime I\n| place         = [[King\'s Landing]]\n| page\t\t= 116\n| previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 7|Cersei II]]\n| current\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 8|Jaime I]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 9|Brienne II]]\n| arc previous\t= \n| arc next\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 16|Jaime II]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\nStanding a planned seven day vigil over [[Tywin Lannister|his father]]\'s funeral bier, [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] finds himself with a lot of time for thinking. He feels that he is as much to blame for his father\'s death as [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] or [[Varys]]. He also finds himself wondering what happened to the eunuch. His thoughts then turn to the day that Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]] rode for the [[Battle of the Trident|Trident]]. Jaime had begged not to be left behind to guard the king, but Rhaegar told him that [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys]] feared Lord Tywin more than he did [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]], and meant to keep Jaime at his side as insurance. Mounting up, Rhaegar\'s last words to Jaime were, &quot;When this battle\'s done I mean to call a council. Changes will be made. I meant to do it long ago, but...well, it does no good to speak of roads not taken.&quot; Finally, Jaime recalls his recent questioning of the [[Rennifer Longwaters|chief undergaoler]], which was a complete farce as Jaime knew far more than the man did, since he was the perpetrator.\n\nWhen Jaime learned that the two gaolers who were put to sleep were killed by [[Boros Blount]] and [[Osmund Kettleblack]], he reprimanded them, warning them never to act on [[Cersei Lannister|his sister]]\'s orders to kill anyone without consulting him first. \nSome time in the middle of the night, Cersei visits him with news of [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]]\'s refusal to become her [[Hand of the King|Hand]], as well as remarking that Kevan knows about their relationship. She implores Jaime to reconsider being Hand, but Jaime rejects her again. She departs with, &quot;Very well. If it is battlefields you want, battlefields I shall give you.&quot; The next morning, the mourners arrive anew, but the smell is so nauseating that [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] gets sick. Jaime takes him outside to console him, advising him to &quot;go away inside&quot;, something Tommen understands from when [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] would torment him. Cersei then joins them, as does [[Mace Tyrell]], and Jaime asks the Lord of [[Highgarden]] to have dinner with his sister. When Mace departs, Jaime tells Cersei to get the wedding over with, and then send Lord Mace to besiege [[Storm\'s End]] once again. Cersei likes the idea, hoping Tyrell might lose his life this time.\n\n==References and Notes==\n\n*The synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/03/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-feast-for-crows-part-6 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Feast for Crows, Part 6].

Dany is pretending not to know [[High Valyrian]] speech, but she understands everything the slaver is saying to the translator. [[Kraznys mo Nakloz|Kraznys]] demonstrates the loyalty of the Unsullied, how the eunuchs follow every command given them and feel hardly any pain. Both Daenerys and [[Barristan Selmy|Arstan]] are horrified by the conditions the Unsullied live under, and the brutality of their training. The slaver indicates he has 8,000 Unsullied currently for sale. Daenerys informs him she will spend the night considering the offer. \n\nArstan is against the use of slaves, when [[Sellsword|sellswords]] can be bought in the [[Free Cities]]; he insists that if Daenerys lands in [[Westeros]] at the head of a slave army, many of the realm\'s people will oppose her for no more reason than the abbhorence of slavery. Daenerys is, however, too proud to go back to [[Pentos]] as a beggar, not after seeing what it did to her [[Viserys Targaryen|brother]], how bitter and angry constantly begging for help left him.\n\nLonely since [[Drogo|her husband\'s]] death and confused over Ser [[Jorah Mormont]]\'s advances on her, Daenerys takes [[Irri]] as a lover one night, the [[Dothraki]] handmaiden more than willing to sexually pleasure her [[Khaleesi]], but Daenerys finds no release, only guilt over treating her handmaid as a bedslave.\n\nThe next morning, when Ser Jorah comes to speak with her, Daenerys snaps at him; she despises Astapor and has only contempt for the Unsullied, but she still recognizes that they are too useful to pass up. Ser Jorah also gives Daenerys more food for thought on hiring the Unsullied, pointing out that they don\'t rape nor put to the sword the population of cities they\'ve conquered unless specifically ordered to, minimizing the bloodshed that will inevitably occur when Daenerys starts the war to reclaim her throne. He also points out their usefulness in answering Daenerys\' query as to why Astapor has never been sacked, since any enemy attacking Astapor would face the city\'s entire garrison of Unsullied, there are few neighboring cities and nations that pose a threat, and the combination of the Unsullied\'s reputation and heavy bribes offered by Astapor\'s rulers are enough to dissuade passing Dothraki [[Khalasar|Khalasars]] from attacking the city.\n\nDaenerys is tempted, knowing that Viserys would purchase as many Unsullied as he could, but she questions if she can be anything like [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]], to whom Arstan and Jorah keep comparing her, if the loyalty of her men is only based on being bought and paid for. Ser Jorah points out that Rhaegar\'s honor and the loyalty he inspired in his men didn\'t save him from dying at [[Battle of the Trident|the Trident]].\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n*[[Missandei]]\n*[[Kraznys mo Nakloz]]\n*[[Barristan Selmy]] Arstan\n*[[Viserys Targaryen]]\n*Khal [[Drogo]]\n*[[Jorah Mormont]]\n*[[Irri]]\n*[[Jhiqui]]\n*[[Aggo]]\n*[[Jhogo]]\n*[[Groleo]]\n*[[Aerys II Targaryen]]\n*[[Rhaegar Targaryen]]\n}}\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Astapor]]\n*[[Unsullied]]\n*[[High Valyrian]]\n*[[Sellsword]]\n*[[Free Cities]]\n*[[Westeros]]\n*[[Pentos]]\n*[[Dothraki]]\n*[[Khaleesi]]\n*[[Khalasar]]\n*[[Battle of the Trident]]\n}}\n\n\n==References and Notes==\n* The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/01/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-14 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Part 14].

[[Ellaria Sand]] has left [[Sunspear]] to go back to [[Hellholt]], her father [[Harmen Uller]]\'s seat, with [[Loreza Sand|Loreza]]. [[Dorea Sand]] remains at the [[Water Gardens]], hidden among all the children, and [[Obella Sand]] is dispatched to Sunspear as a cupbearer. Ellaria\'s [[Sand Snakes]] are now scattered, so as to better to survive the carnage.\n\nArianne and her group travel for two days and two nights, and Arianne starts to reminisce. She thinks about how she and Daemon Sand, once so close, grew apart after [[Doran Martell]] had refused to let Daemon marry Arianne. She thinks about [[Spotted Sylva]], [[Drey]] and [[Garin (Orphan)|Garin]], and about how one of them must have betrayed her. She misses her friends, and she misses [[Arys Oakheart]] as well, more than she expected. She believes he charged into [[Areo Hotah]]\'s axe because he could not live with what he had done. All of Arianne\'s friends have suffered because of her plot, except for Darkstar, Ser [[Gerold Dayne]], who fooled Arianne with his good looks. [[Obara Sand]] has been sent to hunt Darkstar down, and Arianne is convinced that her cousin is up for the task, especially since Areo is with her, but Daemon warns her that Darkstar could kill Obara just as easily, when she confides in him. \n\nThe second day of their journey, they move at a more sedate pace, and Arianne commands Daemon to tell her all he knows about [[Jon Connington]], but all he can tell her is information Arianne has already learned from her father. What Daemon tells her does leave her thinking, and that night in her tent she reads the letter Jon sent to Prince Doran, informing him that [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaegar)|Aegon Targaryen]], [[Elia Martell]]\'s son by [[Rhaegar Targaryen]], is still alive, and asking for the help of [[Dorne]]. But Prince Doran has his doubts, Arianne knows as well. He was expecting [[House Targaryen|a dragon]] to return to Westeros, but this is not the one he was waiting for. They have not heard anything about [[Daenerys Targaryen]] and [[Quentyn Martell]], and Prince Doran worries. Two Dornish armies have amassed, and one word from Arianne will make them march.\n\nOn the third day of their journey, they reach Ghost Hill, where they sup with Lady [[Nymella Toland]] and her two daughters, and here Arianne learns that [[Griffin\'s Roost]], [[Rain House]], [[Crow\'s Nest]], [[Mistwood]] and [[Greenstone]] have [[Landing of the Golden Company|fallen]] to the [[Golden Company]] with certainty, and there are rumors about [[Tarth]], [[Cape Wrath]] and half the [[Stepstones]] having fallen to them as well. Lady [[Valena Toland]] also tells that there are [[elephant]]s in the [[rainwood]], and Arianne takes this to mean that Quentyn has not yet returned. Lady Nymella and Valena go on to discuss the fighting on the Stepstones.\n\nLady Nymella\xc2\xb4s youngest daughter, [[Teora Toland]], has a different opinion. She has dreamed about dragons, and everywhere the dragons danced, people died.\n\nThat night, Arianne tries to seduce Ser Daemon, but he resists, so they talk instead about whether or not Aegon could truly have survived. Arianne voices Doran\xc2\xb4s wishes, but her answers to Daemon\xc2\xb4s questions do not truly reflect her feelings inside. She wishes that Quentyn had returned, but cannot stop thinking how silly &quot;King Quentyn&quot; sounds, nor how silly Quentyn riding a dragon would be.\n\nThey continue their voyage on a ship called the \'\'[[Peregrine]]\'\', where Arianne and Daemon discuss [[Viserys Targaryen]], the Beggar King. Arianne wonders why Daenerys allowed Viserys to be killed by her own husband, Khal [[Drogo]]: {{quote|Perhaps Daenerys realizes that once her brother was crowned and wed to me, she would be doomed to spend the rest of her life sleeping in a tent and smelling like a horse.}}\nWhen she tells Daemon that Daenerys is [[Aerys II Targaryen|the Mad King]]\'s daughter, wondering if she has the taint as well, Daemon answers:\n{{quote|We cannot know.

Hailing from [[the Reach]], the Oakhearts have long been enemies of the Dornish. The kingsguard knight left [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]] playing [[cyvasse]] with Prince [[Trystane Martell|Trystane]], and under the protection of the prince\'s sworn shield Ser [[Gascoyne]]. Arys recalls his recent first meeting with Prince [[Doran Martell|Doran]], who advised him that Myrcella would be safer at the [[Water Gardens]]. All her guards and Ser Arys would accompany them there, but Doran asked him not to write [[King\'s Landing]] about the move. When he arrives at Arianne\'s secret location, he swears he will do no more than tell her it has to end, but her nakedness overwhelms him.\n\nAfter their passion is sated, Arys is once again consumed by guilt, but Arianne has a response for every one of his doubts. The knight feels he has dishonored himself enough already, and he doesn\'t want to dishonor her. But Arianne\'s seductive words and gestures are difficult for him to disregard. When Arianne reminds him that he told her he loved her, Arys responds that he has sworn a vow. However, Arianne brings up several Kingsguard who broke their vows, most famously [[Lucamore Strong|Lucamore the Lusty]] and [[Terrence Toyne]], and even Prince [[Aemon Targaryen|Aemon the Dragonknight]] (though Ser Arys doesn\'t believe the latter story). She finishes with, &quot;It is not our love that dishonored you, it is the monsters you have served and the brutes you\'ve called your brothers.&quot; When Arys tells her that King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] was no monster, he can\'t help but think that she is right about [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]]. Although he considers [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] to be Joffrey\'s opposite, he can\'t disagree with Arianne\'s persuasive words that Myrcella would be a better ruler. \n\nTheir conversation moves to [[Criston Cole]], Lord Commander of [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys I]]\'s Kingsguard. At the time of Viserys\' death, Ser Cole convinced Viserys\' son Aegon II to claim the rule of the Seven Kingdoms. This led to the war between Aegon and his elder sister Rhaenyra, whom Viserys had long groomed as his succession. \n\nArianne reminds Arys that in Dorne, the eldest child rules, and had it not been for Criston the Kingmaker, even the Targaryen inheritance might have been rewritten. She then explains to him the real reason that Myrcella is being moved to the Water Gardens: &quot;To keep her away from those who\'d seek to crown her.&quot; Arys tells her that the Water Gardens are not a prison, but she warns him that [[Areo Hotah|Hotah]] will see that Myrcella does not leave, claiming he is terrible when aroused.\n\nStill unable to convince Arys that her suggestions are correct, Arianne hugs him and begins to tremble. Once again, she manipulates him by asserting that if the [[Sand Snakes]] can be imprisoned by her father for wanting to crown Myrcella, she could too. She mentions that there are no secrets between [[Tyene Sand|Tyene]] and herself, and then tells him her father has never considered her worthy. Prince Doran tried several times to marry her off to old men of high birth, and when she was 14 she discovered a letter her father had written to her brother [[Quentyn Martell|Quentyn]], a ward of [[Anders Yronwood|Lord Anders Yronwood]] for years. In the letter, Doran wrote, &quot;one day you will sit where I sit and rule  all of Dorne, and a ruler must be strong of mind and body.&quot;\n\nSer Arys argues that this couldn\'t be true, but when she asks him where Prince Quentyn is now and his response is with Lord Anders Yronwood in the [[Boneway]], Arianne tells him that is what her father wants everyone to believe. She has gotten word from some of her friends that Quentyn is across the [[Narrow Sea]], and she is sure that he is hiring the [[Golden Company]], who recently broke their contract with [[Myr]]. The Golden Company has never broken their word since [[Aegor Rivers|Bittersteel]] reformed them nearly a hundred years ago, and since most of their members are exiles, the only reason they would change allegiance would be to return home to [[Westeros]]. And Anders\' ancestors fought in three of the [[Blackfyre Rebellion]]s, a fact that convinces Arianne that he seeks to crown Quentyn as the next Prince of Dorne.\n\nArianne\'s final persuasive words are, &quot;So your two princesses share a common cause, ser... and they share as well a knight who claims to love them both, but will not fight for them.&quot; Ser Arys then swears to defend Myrcella\'s right to rule, and to protect Arianne from anyone seeking to steal her birthright. When he asks her what she would have of him, Arianne purrs, &quot;All. All my love, my sweet love, and forever. But  first...Myrcella.&quot;\n\n==References and Notes==    \n*The synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/03/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-feast-for-crows-part-9 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Feast for Crows, Part 9].

He asks if she still means to burn down the [[Tower of the Hand]] after the wedding, but she is determined to see it destroyed, and hopefully smoke out a few rats in the process. We begin to notice changes in Cersei, including weight gain and overindulgence in alcohol. Tommen\'s wedding is a modest affair compared to [[Joffrey Baratheon|his brother]]\'s, and the ceremony goes over well enough. Afterwards, [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]] comes over to Cersei and mentions that [[Sandor Clegane]] is reported to have joined [[Beric Dondarrion]]\'s [[Brotherhood Without Banners|outlaws]]. The queen is already aware of this, having heard that outlaws have pillaged [[Saltpans]] and savagely raped the townswomen. The report mentioned that they were led by a huge man in a hound\'s head helmet.\n\nCersei suggests that [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]] hunt down the Hound, but her uncle scoffs that his son is not the man to deal with Clegane. When she then suggests that he go after Clegane himself, Ser Kevan responds, &quot;When a dog goes bad, the fault lies with its master.&quot; Talking to Jaime, she wonders if Margaery is really a maiden, and he tells her that [[Mace Tyrell]] will be marching on [[Storm\'s End]] in a few days, while [[Garlan Tyrell]] will take half the Tyrell host to [[Brightwater Keep]] and then on to [[Highgarden]], including Lady [[Alerie Tyrell]] and Lady Olenna. During the reception, Cersei recalls her visit to a [[Maegi|woods witch]] when she was younger, and the old hag\'s words: Queen you shall be, until there comes another, younger and more beautiful, to cast you down and take all you  hold dear. Drinking heavily during the feast, she begins to wonder if Margaery is the one in the hag\'s prophecy, which also mentions the [[valonqar]].\n\nWhen Tommen chokes on his wine accidentally, Cersei flees the hall for some air. She is met outside by Lady [[Taena of Myr|Taena]], who informs her that one of Cersei\'s maids is a spy reporting to Margaery\'s cousins. Cersei assumes it is [[Senelle]], and promises to reward Lady Merryweather if this is true. Asking why the beauty from Myr would venture this info, Taena responds that she wants what is best for her [[Orton Merryweather|husband]] and [[Russell Merryweather|son]], and Cersei could provide advancement for [[House Merryweather|her family]]. Back inside, Cersei refuses to dance with anyone, but takes note of how attractive the Bastard of Driftmark, [[Aurane Waters]], is: with his silvery hair - a mark of [[house Velaryon]] which is descended from the Freehold of [[Valyria]] like [[House Targaryen|the Targaryens]] - he almost resembles [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Prince Rhaegar]].\n\nTowards the end of the night, Cersei leads everyone outside to watch as the pyromancers set the Tower of the Hand on fire. As the green flames of wildfire consume the Tower, the queen regent compares the beauty of the spectacle to Joffrey. As the others begin to depart for bed, Cersei remains behind to watch the fires burn, arm in arm with Ser [[Osmund Kettleblack]].\n\n==References and Notes==\n*The synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/03/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-feast-for-crows-part-8 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Feast for Crows, Part 8].

After meeting with her ailing [[Hoster Tully|father]], she seeks out [[Robb Stark|Robb]] in the [[godswood]]. After praying with his bannermen, Robb calls a council to determine their next move. The council argues for hours about which way to march and which king to support until [[Greatjon Umber]] gives a rousing speech and the bannermen proclaim Robb the [[King in the North]].\n    \n==Synopsis==    \n\n[[File:Riverrun castle.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Riverrun, the seat of House Tully \xe2\x80\x93 by Franz Miklis \xc2\xa9 Fantasy Flight Games]]\n\nTo [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]], it seems a thousand years since she left [[Riverrun]] by boat with an infant [[Robb Stark|Robb]] to head north to [[Winterfell]] for the first time. Now she is returning by boat across the [[Tumblestone|same river]] with a son who wears plate and mail instead of swaddling clothes. With them in the boat is [[Theon Greyjoy]], and in the boat following are [[Brynden Tully]], [[Jon Umber (Greatjon)|Greatjon Umber]], and [[Rickard Karstark]].\n\nAs they draw near, the men on the walls cheer them as the banners of [[House Tully]] fly from every rampart, but Catelyn cannot feel anything but sadness since she received news of [[Eddard Stark|her husband]]\xe2\x80\x99s death, and she wonders if her heart will ever lift again. After passing under the wall through the wide Water Gate, they are greeted on the water stair by Catelyn\xe2\x80\x99s brother Ser [[Edmure Tully]] and Lord [[Tytos Blackwood]]. A worn-looking Edmure embraces Catelyn, expresses his condolences, and promises vengeance against the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]]. Catelyn only says that it will not bring Ned back, then states she has to see [[Hoster Tully|her father]].\n\nShe is escorted to her father\xe2\x80\x99s solar in the keep, which is three-sided like Riverrun itself. Along the way, Catelyn asks about her father, and--as expected--Edmure explains that he is dying. When Catelyn demands to know why she was not notified, Edmure explains that with the [[Seven Kingdoms]] so volatile their father forbid it; if word had gotten out that he was ailing, the Lannisters might have attacked. Catelyn immediately blames herself, remembering it was she who sparked the war by [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 28|arresting]] [[Tyrion Lannister]].\n\nThe solar is also triangular with a balcony to the east from which the walls, battlements, and river fork can be seen. Lord Hoster\xe2\x80\x99s bed has been moved onto the balcony so he can sit in the sun and watch the rivers. He is shrunken, looking much older and frailer than Catelyn remembers. Lord Hoster calls her \xe2\x80\x9cLittle Cat\xe2\x80\x9d and tells how he wanted to be awake when she arrived; he was afraid he would not wake again. He speaks weakly and is wracked by spasms of pain. He defends his decision to keep news of his illness a secret, but admits that he was afraid he would die before seeing her again, especially once the siege began. She tells him that Robb is here, they have [[Jaime Lannister]] in irons, and Riverrun is free again. This leads Lord Hoster to tell her of the joy he had as he watched the [[Battle of the Camps|battle]] from the battlements.\n\nHer father asks if it was Robb who won the battle and Catelyn tells him that it was. Then she mentions that Ser Brynden was also an important figure. Lord Hoster seems surprised by the mention of the Blackfish and asks if [[Lysa Arryn|Lysa]] has come down from the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]] as well. Catelyn cannot lie and explains that Lysa is frightened and believes she and her son are only safe in the [[Eyrie]]. Hoster is very disappointed that he will not see her.\n\nLord Hoster agrees to see Robb, who he remembers has his Tully eyes. When Catelyn presses on to ask if he will see his brother, her father asks if Ser Brynden has married anyone yet. Catelyn is saddened that her father cannot allow the old feud to rest. She tells him that his brother has not wed, nor will he ever. Lord Hoster launches into a weak rant, criticizing Brynden\xe2\x80\x99s choice to defy him and never marry, saying that [[Bethany Redwyne]] is still waiting for Brynden. Catelyn has to remind her father that Bethany Redwyne has long ago married Lord [[Mathis Rowan]] and has three children. Her father states there were also offers from others, including Lord [[Jonos Bracken]]\xe2\x80\x99s daughter or any of three by [[Walder Frey]]. Catelyn tells how she would not have made it to Riverrun without Brynden, and her father agrees that he was always a warrior. Lord Hoster agrees to see his brother later but he is too tired to fight now. Hoster is asleep before Catelyn leaves the solar. \n\nBrynden is talking with the Riverrun guards when Catelyn returns, but he anxiously asks about his brother, and Catelyn confirms that he is dying. When Brynden asks if Hoster will see him, Catelyn conveys that he will but he is too tired to fight. Ser Brynden only laughs that his brother will be chiding him about the Redwyne girl as they light his funeral pyre. Catelyn smiles and asks where she can find Robb.\n\nIn the halls Catelyn finds Theon regaling the garrison an account of the battle and of how [[Grey Wind]] tore off a man\xe2\x80\x99s arm and drove the Lannister horses mad. When asked, Theon tells her that he believes Robb went to the [[godswood]]. She realizes that this is just what Eddard would do after a battle.\n\nCatelyn finds Robb praying with those of his lords bannermen who hold to the [[old gods]], including the Greatjon, Rickard Karstark, [[Maege Mormont]], [[Galbart Glover]], and Lord Tytos Blackwood (one of a very few followers of the old gods south of [[the Neck]]). She feels she should not disturb their prayers. As she walks through the godswood, memories of her childhood beset Catelyn. Here her father taught her to ride, there Edmure fell and broke his arm, and under that bower she and Lysa played at kissing with [[Petyr Baelish]] and he tried to tongue them with mint from the godswood on his breath. As Robb rises from his prayers, Catelyn wonders if Robb--who has ridden into battle and killed men with a sword--has ever been kissed in the godswood.\n\nWhen he sees her, Robb declares that they must call a council. Catelyn tries to get him to see his very sick grandfather, but Robb insists that first they must meet to discuss the news that [[Renly Baratheon]] has proclaimed himself king. Catelyn says she had expected it to be Lord [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] and Galbart Glover says they all did. \n\nThe meeting is held in the great hall at four long tables. Lord Hoster is too weak to attend, but the attendance includes Edmure and the Blackfish with the Tully bannermen arrayed around them: Lord [[Jonos Bracken]], Lord [[Tytos Blackwood]], Lord [[Jason Mallister]], Ser [[Marq Piper]], Ser [[Stevron Frey]], [[Karyl Vance]] (a lord now, following his father\xe2\x80\x99s death), and Lord [[Lyman Darry]], son of Ser [[Raymun Darry]]. The smaller number of northern lords sits opposite: Robb, Theon, Rickard Karstark (grief-stricken over the death of his two sons), Maege Mormont, Galbart Glover, and Greatjon Umber. \n\nThe lords argue late into the night with every lord taking full advantage of his right to speak. [[Roose Bolton]] has reformed their other host at the mouth of the causeway. Lord [[Tywin Lannister]] has crossed the [[Trident]] and is making for [[Harrenhal]]. Some lords favor marching east to meet Lord Tywin at Harrenhal. Marq Piper favors marching west to [[Casterly Rock]]. Jason Mallister suggests they simply stay athwart Lord Tywin\xe2\x80\x99s supply lines and rest their troops. Jonos Bracken proposes they pledge fealty to Renly and move south to join him.\n\nRobb, speaking for the first time, insists that Renly is not the king. The lords protest that Robb cannot mean to hold to [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], who executed his father. Robb insists that that makes Joffrey evil, but does not make Renly king; as the youngest brother, Renly cannot be king before Stannis. That splits the room again, with some favoring Stannis and some still favoring Renly who is crowned and has [[Highgarden]] and [[Storm\'s End]] to support him. Robb states he does not know what to do since Joffrey is the true heir, but he executed [[Eddard Stark|his father]] based on a lie. Ser [[Stevron Frey]], old [[Walder Frey]]\xe2\x80\x99s heir, suggests that they make peace and allow Renly and Joffrey to fight and oppose or submit to the winner as they choose; Lord Tywin would welcome the truce and the return of his son. This is met with shouts of outrage.\n\nCatelyn suggests a peace. Robb reminds her that the Lannisters murdered her husband and that he will have no peace with them, laying his sword on the table to emphasize his point. Catelyn points out that the war was started to free Eddard and to protect the Riverlands. The Riverlands are now safe and no amount of vengeance will bring her husband back. She wants her daughters safe, for Robb to be safe and ruling from [[Winterfell]], and to go home. Ser Brynden questions what the terms of peace could be that would prevent another war in the near future. Rickard Karstark and Jonos Bracken question what their sacrifices have been worth if peace is made now. Tytos Blackwood notes that if they make peace with King Joffrey, are they not traitors to King Renly? Catelyn\xe2\x80\x99s hopes of peace shatter before her eyes.\n\nThe meeting breaks down into another argument of which king to support, until [[Greatjon Umber|the Greatjon]] rises to his feet and silences them all. He spits upon all the kings and declares that Renly and Stannis are nothing to him. He asks why they should rule over him and his from some flowery seat in the south when they know nothing about [[the North]]. Even their [[Faith of the Seven|gods]] are wrong. The Greatjon asks why they should not rule themselves again. It was the [[House Targaryen|dragons]] they submitted to and the dragons are all dead. Then the immense man points his two-handed greatsword at Robb and proclaims: \n\n{{Quote|\'\' \'\'\'There\'\'\' sits the only king I mean to bend \'\'\'my\'\'\' knee to, m\xe2\x80\x99lords. The [[King in the North]]!\'\' |}} \n\nThe other bannermen all take up the call, even the river lords who have never been ruled from Winterfell. And for the first time in 300 years, there is a King in the North.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/12/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-34 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/072/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n*[http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2010/02/jon-catelyn.html Humorous review of the chapter] by Jason.\n\n==References and Notes==\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 71]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Catelyn Tully]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Riverrun]]\n\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 72, Catelyn]][[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\x9a\xd0\xb5\xd0\xb9\xd1\x82\xd0\xb8\xd0\xbb\xd0\xb8\xd0\xbd XI]]</text>\n      <sha1>27yjemk3eck8q0o3bgr5il9jdzwonjt</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 57</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6914</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>196421</id>\n      <parentid>167053</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-12-10T22:31:47Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3828">{{Infobox Chapter ADwD\n| pov\t\t= [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n| place         = [[Yunkai|Yunkish]] camp near [[Meereen]]\n| title\t\t= Tyrion XI\n| page\t\t= 754\n| previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 56|The Iron Suitor]]\n| current\t= Tyrion XI\n| next\t\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 58|Jon XII]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 47|Tyrion X]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 66|Tyrion XII]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Yezzan zo Qaggaz]] is dying of the [[bloody flux]]. A healer explains to [[Sweets]] that the only help for Yezzan is good clean water.  [[Nurse]] also got the bloody flux and died the night before after Tyrion gave him dogtail soup with silver mushrooms in the broth. Tyrion asks [[Scar]], a soldier slave in Yezzan\'s ownership, to send 2 men to get fresh clean water for Yezzan. Scar refuses because he will not take orders from a slave, even though he himself is a slave. He tells Tyrion to get the water himself with Penny. Tyrion asks for the mule and the cart to get the water. Scar refuses but gives them [[Jorah Mormont]] to help get the water. The three of them travel through the camp to the nearest well south and west of a [[trebuchet]], the Harridan. On the way, Tyrion sees defenses being built to defend against the possible return of [[Drogon]], although he knows that most of these will prove useless against [[dragon]]s. Tyrion knows that a dragon\'s eyes are its only weak spot, and not the underbelly or throat as old wives\' tales claim. While waiting at the well, they hear the latest news and rumors from other slaves, who are discussing the event at [[Daznak\'s Pit]]. It is argued whether [[Daenerys Targaryen]] flew off on the dragon or died trying. Tyrion states she did not die because her body was not found. He briefly thinks on the moment when he almost revealed his identity to her, only to stop out of fear [[Barristan Selmy]] would prejudice Daenerys against him out of contempt for [[House Lannister]].\n\nAfter getting the water, they are supposed to return to their camp, but Tyrion leads them to the tents of the [[Second Sons]] instead. He knows that right now, while Yezzan is on the verge of death, is the best time for them to try and escape the grasp of the slavers. When they get there, Tyrion is recognized as the dwarf that [[Brown Ben Plumm]] wished to buy so they are brought to the captain. There he reveals that he knows that Ben Plumm knows who Tyrion really is and that Tyrion knows that Plumm is a westerman and of [[House Plumm]] and that the dragons were fond of him. He implies that he knows more about Plumm\'s lineage than even Plumm himself, and that Plumm may have more [[Targaryen]] blood than he thinks. Ben Plumm then recognizes Jorah Mormont, and Tyrion convinces Ben Plumm to let him and Mormont join the Second Sons instead of killing him in order to win a lordship from [[Cersei Lannister]]. Tyrion suggests they play a game of \'\'cyvasse\'\' as they continue talking.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n* [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n* [[Yezzan zo Qaggaz]]\n* [[Penny]]\n* [[Sweets]]\n* [[Bloodbeard]]\n* [[Nurse]]\n* [[Lomas Longstrider]]\n* [[Scar]]\n* [[Morgo]]\n* [[Jorah Mormont]]\n* [[Zahrina]]\n* Septon [[Barth]]\n* [[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n* [[Griff]]\n* [[Rolly Duckfield]] (&quot;Duck&quot;)\n* [[Haldon]]\n* [[Barristan Selmy]]\n* [[Illyrio]]\n* [[Jaime Lannister]]\n* [[Ghazdor zo Ahlaq]]\n* [[Sansa Stark]]\n* [[Ben Plumm]]\n* [[Bronn]]\n* [[Baelor I Targaryen]]\n* [[Viserys Plumm]]\n* [[Tybero Istarion]] (Inkpots)\n* [[Kasporio]] (&quot;the Cunning&quot;)\n* [[Shagga]]\n* [[Timett]]\n}}\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 57]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Tyrion Lannister]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Meereen]]\n\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 57]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 58, Tyrion]]</text>\n      <sha1>k3rv4dj7ushw2uhjib5tnkx9rfq72sx</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Clash of Kings-Chapter 66</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6231</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166469</id>\n      <parentid>142915</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-23T21:01:45Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3317">{{Infobox Chapter ACfK\n| pov\t\t= [[Theon Greyjoy]]\n| place         = [[Winterfell]]\n| title\t\t= Theon VI\n| page\t\t= 670\n| previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 65|Sansa VIII]]\n| current\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 66|Theon VI]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 67|Tyrion XV]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 56|Theon V]]\n| arc next\t=\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\nMaester [[Luwin]] warns [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] to yield when Ser [[Rodrik Cassel|Rodrik]] arrives, for there will be no siege. Theon has too few men to hold the castle against two thousand men. The maester advises that Lord [[Balon Greyjoy|Balon]] is concerned about [[Moat Cailin]], because [[the North]] will be won or lost there, not at [[Winterfell]]. Luwin tells him to ask for mercy, but Theon will not hear of it. Only seventeen of his men stay with him; the rest desert along with all ten of [[Asha Greyjoy|Asha]]\xe2\x80\x99s men. Even the men who remain loyal have contempt for him, and his plan to stay Rodrik\xe2\x80\x99s hand. When the old castellan surrounds the castle, Theon comes out to parley. Rodrik gives him the chance to die honorably, but Theon pulls out his trump card: Rodrik\'s daughter, [[Beth Cassel]], with a noose around her neck. Rodrik is horrified, but he is too honorable to withdraw, and tells Theon he has until sunset before he storms the walls.\n\nLater, Theon is practicing archery, knowing he cannot win, when Luwin tells him there is a way he can live through this: yield, and [[Night\'s Watch|take the black]]. Theon decides that he will take the black and perhaps save some of his dignity and honor, but he never gets the chance. Fighting has broken out in Winterfell\'s winter town between several hundred men from [[the Dreadfort]] and Rodrik\xe2\x80\x99s army of near two thousand. The Dreadfort men win because they were at first accepted as allies until they began slaughtering Rodrik\xe2\x80\x99s troops.\n\nAfter the [[battle at Winterfell]] ends, Theon meets their leader, whom he identifies as [[Reek]], but learns the man all along was [[Ramsay Snow]]. The bastard prefers to call himself Ramsay Bolton, however. Ramsay states he had a ring given to him by [[Roose Bolton|his father]] which allowed him certain authority at the Dreadfort. Ramsay also presents the bodies of Rodrik Cassel, [[Cley Cerwyn]], and [[Leobald Tallhart]]. The Bastard of Bolton strikes Theon with a punch to the face, and then commands his men, &quot;Save me [[House Frey|the Freys]] and burn the rest. Burn it, burn it all.&quot; The last thing Theon sees during the [[sack of Winterfell]] is his horse [[Smiler]] afire.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n\n* The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n* [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2012/02/re-read-theon-vi-turncloak-turncloaked.html Analyses and summary of the chapter] in the course of a 10th reread by Slynt\n* [http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/08/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-31 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 66]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Theon Greyjoy]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Winterfell]]\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 66]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 67, Theon]]</text>\n      <sha1>23g2xn6nafhajpko7b9yzao1qt6lpds</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 9</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5758</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>99338</id>\n      <parentid>93614</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2013-06-22T15:51:31Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Visen</username>\n        <id>5916</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2164">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Bran Stark|Bran]]\n| place         = [[Wolfswood]] - [[Tumbledown Tower]]\n| title\t\t= Bran I\n| page\t\t= 100\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 8|Daenerys I]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 9|Bran I]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 10|Davos II]]\n| arc previous\t= \n| arc next\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 24|Bran II]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\nWhile hiding in the [[Tumbledown Tower]], [[Bran Stark|Bran]] gains the ability to open his third eye at will, and become [[Summer (direwolf)|Summer]].

He sends [[Urzen]] to investigate and wakes [[Wex Pyke|Wex]] to make sure [[Bran Stark|Bran]] and [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]] are in their beds. Wex returns to inform Theon that the wolves are gone, along with both boys, and that a couple of his ironmen have been killed outside the [[Winterfell#Hunter\'s Gate|Hunter\'s Gate]]. He orders them to roust the castle and have Black [[Lorren]] check the gates.\n\nTheon has already sent [[Stygg]] to fetch help from his sister [[Asha Greyjoy|Asha]] at [[Deepwood Motte]], but help is far off. He learns that both [[House Reed|Reeds]], [[Hodor]], and [[Osha]] are missing as well, and Theon curses himself for trusting the wildling woman. He has the people of [[Winterfell]] gather and demands to know the whereabouts of [[Bran Stark|Bran]] and [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]]. When no one responds, [[Reek]] tells Theon to strip off their skins, as Lord [[Roose Bolton|Bolton]] used to say, &quot;A naked man has few secrets, but a flayed man\xe2\x80\x99s got none.&quot; Theon considers what he knows of the [[House Bolton|Boltons]], that their lords used to wear cloaks made from the skins of their enemies, and several Starks \xe2\x80\x98ended thus\xe2\x80\x99. Supposedly, that stopped a thousand years ago when the Boltons bent the knee to Winterfell. \n\nTheon then sets out with several of his men, bringing along a couple of huntsmen from Winterfell, as well as Maester [[Luwin]] since he cannot be trusted if left alone. [[Walder Frey (son of Merrett)|Little Walder]] comes too, saying he wants a wolfskin cloak. They track the boys into the [[Wolfswood]], but lose the trail by a stream. No matter how hard they search, the hounds cannot regain the trail, and they begin to head back to Winterfell, with Theon despairing of how he can reverse the indignity of losing the boys, especially with [[Asha Greyjoy|Asha]] soon to arrive.\n\nTheon does not want to appear weak before his sister, but Reek comes to the rescue by showing him the contents of a bag he is carrying. He suggests the boys are hiding at the old mill on the [[Acorn Water]]. Theon is somehow sure they\xe2\x80\x99re there, and sends the others back to Winterfell, telling Maester Luwin he will show no mercy to the boys since his patience has worn out.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n*[http://slynt.blogspot.com/2012/01/re-read-theon-iv-mercy-was-for-morning.html Analyses and summary of the chapter] in the course of a 10th reread by Slynt.\n* [http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/06/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-24 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n* The synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html]\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 50]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Theon Greyjoy]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Winterfell]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in the Wolfswood]]\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 50]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 51, Theon]]</text>\n      <sha1>rp1s3lhxjzx1615ourcfrpv1usp27o2</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 15</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6821</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166547</id>\n      <parentid>118045</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-25T15:13:43Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1940">{{Infobox Chapter ADwD\n| pov\t\t= [[Davos Seaworth]]\n| place         = [[White Harbor]]\n| title\t\t= Davos II\n| page\t\t= 192\n| previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 14|Tyrion IV]]\n| current\t= Davos II\n| next\t\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 16|Daenerys III]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 9|Davos I]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 19|Davos III]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\nAs the \'\'[[Merry Midwife]]\'\' arrives in [[White Harbor]], [[Davos Seaworth|Davos]] notices that the city is newly fortified.

She worries. [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] seems to have a cold and the current [[High Septon]] was appointed by [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]]. She wonders if she should have him removed. Tommen and Cersei both notice the stench that is emanating from her father\'s corpse. \n\nAfter the service, the procession of mourners come to offer condolences to Cersei. First is [[Falyse Stokeworth]], who mentions that [[Lollys Stokeworth|her sister]] is ready to give birth and the family would like to name the child Tywin. Cersei is offended and brusquely forbids her. Next is [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]] who is still looking half dead. As he begins to mention his love and then his new-found faith, Cersei heads him off by saying, &quot;Atonement is best achieved through prayer. Silent prayer.&quot; The only mourner to please Cersei is [[Taena of Myr|Taena Merryweather]], who promises that all her friends in the [[Free Cities]] have been notified to watch for and seize Tyrion. \n\nWhen [[Mace Tyrell]] comes before her, he mentions that his uncle [[Garth Tyrell|Garth]] is on the way to assume the duties of [[Master of Coin]]. The Queen Regent, not wishing to see another Tyrell on the small council, immediately backpedals that [[Gyles Rosby]] has already accepted the post. This upsets Tyrell and [[Olenna Redwyne|his mother]], as Tywin had wanted Garth to assume the position. The Queen of Thorns then brings up the terrible smell in the sept, and Cersei wants nothing more than to get rid of the clever old woman. But Lady Olenna states she will not depart until [[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]] is wed to Tommen. Leaving the Sept, Cersei rides back to the [[Red Keep]] with [[Gyles Rosby]], asking him belatedly to be her new master of coin, which he accepts. \n\nBack in her rooms, [[Qyburn]] pays her a visit, revealing that he discovered in the undergaoler\'s sleeping cell a gold coin that dated back to the [[House Gardener|Gardener]] Kings of the Reach. Once again, Cersei is suspicious that the [[House Tyrell|Tyrells]] had a hand in Tyrion\'s escape and Tywin\'s murder. Qyburn then asks if he may experiment on the dying [[Gregor Clegane]] in the [[black cells]], since he is more adept at the nature of death than any of the [[Maesters#Archmaesters|archmaesters]] from the [[Citadel]]. She agrees with his request, but tells him to bring her Gregor\'s head when he dies, as her father had promised it to [[Dorne]]. Finally, [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]] meets with her for dinner, as she had requested.\n\nCersei asks him to be Tommen\'s [[Hand of the King|Hand]]. Kevan first admonishes her for making Mace Tyrell look a fool in front of half the court. He then informs her that he would rather help his son Lancel take control of Castle [[Darry]]. He offers to take up the position as Hand, provided Cersei removes herself from [[King\'s Landing]] and returns to [[Casterly Rock]]. Cersei is infuriated and a fierce argument takes place during which she threatens Kevan. Unfazed, Kevan counsels her to name [[Randyll Tarly]] or [[Mathis Rowan]] as Tommen\'s Hand. As both men are Tyrell vassals, this makes Cersei even more angry and she accuses him of abandoning Tommen. As he departs, Kevan reveals that he knows who Tommen\'s father really is.\n\n==References and Notes==\n*The synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/02/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-feast-for-crows-part-5 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Feast for Crows, Part 5].

[[Lord Commander of the Night\'s Watch|Lord Commander]] [[Jeor Mormont]] dispatches Jon with a report for [[Samwell Tarly]] to send back to [[Castle Black]]. After a short talk with Sam, Jon returns to Mormont to discuss how [[Benjen Stark|his uncle]] might have reacted to the abandoned villages.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:Matt Olson Whitetree.jpg|thumb|320px|left|The heart tree of Whitetree - by Matt Olson\xc2\xa9]]\n\nThe abandoned village of [[Whitetree]] is dominated by the largest tree [[Jon Snow]] has ever seen. The [[weirwood]] shades the entire village beneath its canopy, but the size does not disturb Jon as much as the face, whose jagged mouth is large enough to swallow a sheep and contains human bones. [[Lord Commander of the Night\'s Watch|Lord Commander]] [[Jeor Mormont|Mormont]] notes that the tree is old, and Jon adds that it is powerful as well. \n\n[[Thoren Smallwood]] declares he now understands why the men feared the [[heart tree]]s when they first came to [[Westeros]] and cut them down. Jon replies that [[Eddard Stark|his father]] claimed no man could tell a lie in front of a heart tree, and Mormont agrees his father said the same. Mormont asks Jon to retrieve the blackened skull from the ashes. When he reaches in, Jon finds another skull under it. As he examines the skull, Mormont wishes he had asked why the wildlings burn their dead when there were still a few around to ask. Jon remembers the [[wight]] he fought and is certain he knows the reason.\n\nMusing on what they might learn if bones could talk, Mormont orders the houses searched. Jon is paired with [[Eddison Tollett]], nicknamed Dolorous Edd. As they search, Dolorous Edd says the dead walking is bad enough, but now Mormont wants them talking, too. The grey-haired squire adds that the dead might lie, or be full of tedious complaints. Entering one of the houses, Jon notes the dirt floor and lack of furnishing and calls it is a dismal place to live. Dolorous Edd replies that he was born in such a house, but then fell on hard times. \n\nThey find nothing, as expected. Whitetree is the fourth village they have searched and each has been as empty. When Jon asks what he thinks happened here, Dolorous Edd responds he does not want to imagine. Reemerging, they find [[Chett]] using the hounds to search and cursing angrily. When Jon meets Chett\'s eyes, he can tell there is no love lost between them. Thoren Smallwood, dressed in the late Ser [[Jaremy Rykker]]\'s armor and cloak and looking more lordly than Mormont, declares there were wildlings here a year ago. [[Jarman Buckwell]] replies that much can change in a year. Ser [[Mallador Locke]] opines that fewer wildlings means fewer worries. Then [[Bedwyck]], a five-foot ranger known as Giant, descends from the giant tree to report a lake to the north and low hill to the west. With three hours of daylight left, Mormont decides to head for the lake to make camp. \n\nAfter writing a report to [[Maester Aemon]], the Lord Commander sends Jon to find [[Samwell Tarly]] to send the message. Jarman Buckwell\'s scouts ride out first, followed by Thoren Smallwood\'s vanguard, Mormont\'s main force, the baggage train under Ser Mallador Locke, and finally the rear guard under Ser [[Ottyn Wythers]]; a total of 200 men and 300 horses. As he rides, Jon exercises his scarred fingers to keep his sword hand from growing stiff and clumsy. He is likely to need his sword hand [[beyond the Wall]], especially now. The black brothers left [[Castle Black]] in good spirits, but the silence of the wood has unnerved them all. Not only have the wildlings disappeared, but the game as well. Even the veteran rangers agree the [[haunted forest]] has never seemed so haunted. \n\nHe finds Sam watering the horses who carry the raven cages. A few of the ravens\' shrieks sound like words, and Jon asks if Sam is teaching them to speak. Sam explains three of them to say &quot;snow.&quot; Jon comments that [[Mormont\'s raven|one bird]] croaking his name was enough. When Sam asks about Whitetree, Jon gives him Mormont\'s report. Sam dispatches a raven with the message, lamenting that he wishes it could carry him back as well. When Jon asks about him still being afraid, Sam admits he is not as frightened as he was. At first he could not sleep for fearing every noise was a wildling creeping up to kill him, but now he knows there are no wildlings around. Jon remarks to himself that two hundred brave men left [[the Wall]] and only Sam, the self-confessed coward, is growing less afraid. \n\nSam says he is sore from the rough living, but he is working on his maps. Jon jokingly threatens to volunteer Sam as an outrider, which Sam emphatically protests. Sam then admits he hoped they would stay in the village under a roof. Jon points out that their are not enough houses for everyone and rides off again.\n\n[[Ghost]], who has been hunting well away from the line of march, appears as Jon is swinging wide of the village to avoid the congested column. The white wolf has been having no more luck than the foragers. Jon remembers telling [[Dywen]] that their numbers were probably frightening away the game, but Dywen only agreed the game was being frightened by \'\'something\'\'. \n\nWhen Jon rejoins Mormont, he mentions that Sam is teaching the ravens to talk. Mormont snorts that he will regret that, as they make a lot of noise but say nothing worth hearing. They ride in silence for a while before Jon comments on what his uncle [[Benjen Stark|Benjen]] would make of the empty villages. Mormont continues Jon\'s thought that Benjen would have pushed on to find out why, and perhaps someone or something did not want that known. Mormont declares that when [[Qhorin Halfhand]] joins them, they will be 300 men and not so easy for an enemy to deal with. He promises Jon that they will find them, but Jon wonders if they will be found instead.\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:15%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Jon Snow]]\n*[[Jeor Mormont]]\n*[[Thoren Smallwood]]\n*[[Bedwyck]]\n| style=&quot;width:15%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Eddison Tollett]]\n*[[Chett]]\n*[[Mallador Locke]] \n*[[Samwell Tarly]]\n\n| style=&quot;width:15%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Jaremy Rykker]]\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n*[[Jarman Buckwell]] \n*[[Maester Aemon]]\n| style=&quot;width:15%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Ottyn Wythers]] \n*[[Arya Stark]]\n*[[Grenn]]\n*[[Qhorin Halfhand]]\n*[[Dywen]]\n|}\n\n==Places==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:60;&quot; |\n*[[Whitetree]]\n*[[Castle Black]]\n|}\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n*Analyses and summary of the chapter [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2011/06/re-read-jon-ii-dolorous-for-win.html in the course of a 10th reread] by Slynt.\xc2\xa0\n*[http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2010/04/daenerys-jon.html Humorous review and summary of the chapter] by Jason.\xc2\xa0\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/02/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-7 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 13]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Jon Snow|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 13]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Whitetree]]\n\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 14, Jon]]</text>\n      <sha1>r194a0z37tzkhzywp6jdmp9oej5i4tr</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Clash of Kings-Chapter 30</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6161</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166433</id>\n      <parentid>160164</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-23T20:51:02Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10641">{{Infobox Chapter ACfK\n| pov\t\t= [[Arya Stark]]\n| place         = [[Harrenhal]]\n| title\t\t= Arya VII\n| page\t\t= 334\n| previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 29|Tyrion VII]]\n| current\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 30|Arya VII]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 31|Catelyn III]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 26|Arya VI]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 38|Arya VIII]]\n}}\n\n[[Arya Stark|Arya]] is working for the understeward of the [[Wailing Tower]] doing various chores. When the Ser [[Amory Lorch]] arrives, [[Jaqen H\'ghar]], [[Rorge]] and [[Biter]] are with him. Arya thinks that Jaqen has not seen her, but he interrupts her sleep that night to tell her he will kill three men for her for saving him and his two companions. She avoids Jaqen for a while, but after hearing a story by [[Chiswyck]], she whispers Chiswyck\xe2\x80\x99s name in Jaqen\'s ear. Several days later he falls to his death.\n==Synopsis==\n[[Arya Stark|Arya]] wonders what King [[Harren Hoare]] meant to name the five towers of [[Harrenhal]], but they are now known as the [[Tower of Dread]], the [[Widow\'s Tower]], the [[Wailing Tower]], the [[Tower of Ghosts]], and [[Kingspyre Tower]] since the [[burning of Harrenhal]]. She now sleeps in a niche in the vaults beneath the Wailing Tower. The work is hard, but no harder than the miles she was walking every day, and she can wash and the food is filling; she does not need to find bugs to eat. [[Hot Pie]] is assigned to the kitchens, and [[Gendry]] to the forge, while Arya works for the understeward [[Weese]] doing errands; running messages, drawing water, fetching food, and sometimes serving tables in the barracks hall. Arya hates [[Weese]] and adds him to her list of names. She occasionally gets to see Hot Pie when she is sent to fetch the food for Weese and his charges; Arya does not want to learn the names of Weese\xe2\x80\x99s other charges since it hurts when people she knows die.  \n\nLady [[Shella Whent]] only occupied parts of two towers, letting the rest of the castle go to ruin. She left a small staff when she fled,  inadequate for the host that now occupies the castle. As a result, the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] have to forage for servants to make more of Harrenhal habitable. Harrenhal covers three times the area of [[Winterfell]], but its buildings are much grander: the stables handle 1000 horses, the [[Godswood]] covers 20 acres, the kitchen is as large as Winterfell\xe2\x80\x99s Great Hall, and the Hall of the Hundred Hearths could handle Tywin\xe2\x80\x99s entire host.\n\nSome claim the ghosts of [[Harren Hoare|Harren the Black]] and his sons occupy the Wailing Tower, but Arya knows that they died in the Kingspyre Tower; the wailing is from the wind, and the ghosts never trouble her. However she fears living men, including Ser [[Gregor Clegane]] and [[Tywin Lannister]], who keep their apartments in the Kingspyre Tower. She considers marching up to Tywin and telling him who she is, but figures she would never get close enough to him, and if she did, he would not believe her, and she would get a beating form Weese, whom she fears more than the Mountain; he hits at the slightest provocation. On the road to Harrenhal, she felt like a sheep, but now she feels like a mouse.\n\nThe lords and ladies never notice the grey mice under their feet, and Arya hears many secrets by just listening as she does her duties. The \'slut\' Pretty [[Pia]] is working her way through every knight, the wife of the gaoler is pregnant either by Ser [[Alyn Stackspear]] or a singer [[Wat (Whitesmile)|Whitesmile]], Lord [[Leo Lefford]] keeps a candle lit by his bed because of the ghosts, Ser [[Dunaver]]\xe2\x80\x99s squire [[Jodge]] cannot hold his water at night, the cooks spit on the despised Ser [[Harys Swyft]]\xe2\x80\x99s food, and Maester [[Tothmure]]\xe2\x80\x99s serving girl told her brother that Tywin has ordered the maester to burn a message claiming that Joffrey is a bastard, and to never speak of it again. She also hears from Weese that [[Stannis Baratheon]] and [[Renly Baratheon]] are both kings and have joined the fighting. Many of the Lannister men question how long Joffrey can hold the throne, protected only by [[City Watch of King\'s Landing|Gold Cloaks]] and ruled by a eunuch, a dwarf and a woman. There have also been a number of reports of [[Beric Dondarrion]] being killed by the [[Brave Companions|Bloody Mummers]], but he has already supposedly been killed by [[Amory Lorch]] at [[Rushing Falls]], and twice by the Mountain. \n\nA fortnight later, the queerest collection of men Arya has ever seen arrives, the Bloody Mummers. Weese assures her that she does not want to know them, and is told they are called The Footmen, Toes of the Goat, and Lord Tywin\xe2\x80\x99s Bloody Mummers. They call themselves the Brave Companions and their leader is the very tall, stick thin [[Vargo Hoat]]. They are housed in the Widow\xe2\x80\x99s Tower, for which Arya is thankful. On their first night, Ser [[Harys Swyft]]\xe2\x80\x99s squire is killed and two of the Bloody Mummers are wounded. Tywin hangs both along with one of Lord [[Lewys Lydden]]\xe2\x80\x99s archers who is supposed to have started the trouble. They do not stay long, but before they leave she hears that [[Roose Bolton]] has occupied the [[Ruby Ford]] and her brother is in [[Riverrun]], which is much closer than Winterfell but she does not know where it lies in relation to Harrenhal; if only she could get away.\n\nShe learns that there are captives from the [[Battle of the Green Fork]]. They have been given freedom of the castle in return for a pledge that they will not attempt to escape, but Arya is hoping they can help her escape. There are three Frey brothers and their bastard brother, but they are soon ransomed. There is also a very fat lordling who is always in the kitchen, one that wears a black cloak with white suns, and Lord [[Medger Cerwyn]], whom she recognizes. She figures she can get aid from Lord Cerwyn, but learns later that he died from his wounds.\n\nArya hears all sorts of rumors about Lord Tywin\xe2\x80\x99s plans. Lord Tywin spends his days with his war council. Arya often catches sight of him, and thinks he is strong looking for an old man, and his face reminds her of her father, although they look nothing alike, and she could never picture Tywin laughing.\n\nSer [[Amory Lorch]] arrives one afternoon, looking less frightening in the daylight. He has fewer men than she remembers and many wounded. She is told that they rode all the way around the lake chasing Beric Dondarrion and slaying rebels. Arya figures they are talking about the men of the [[Night\'s Watch]]. At the end of the column she sees [[Jaqen H\'ghar]], [[Rorge]] and [[Biter]] with his body covered in half-healed wounds. Jaqen H\xe2\x80\x99ghar still smiles, and his clothes are filthy, but his hair washed and brushed. His eyes pass right over Arya, and she thinks he did not even notice her. Arya thinks that Gendry was right and she should have let them die. That night, she says the names again: [[Weese]], [[Dunsen]], [[Chiswyck]], [[Polliver]], [[Rafford|Raff]] the Sweetling, the [[Tickler]], [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]], Ser [[Gregor Clegane|Gregor]], Ser [[Amory Lorch]], Ser [[Ilyn Payne|Ilyn]], Ser [[Meryn Trant|Meryn]], and King [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] and [[Cersei Lannister|Queen Cersei]]. She thinks she might add three names to the list, but she is too tired to decide.\n\nShe is dreaming of wolves in the wild when she wakes with Jaqen H\xe2\x80\x99ghar\xe2\x80\x99s hand over her mouth. He notes that the boy Arry became a girl and revealing that he did see her that afternoon. He then explains that she saved three lives, thus he has to repay her by taking three lives of her choice, in order to appease the [[R\'hllor|Red God]]. When Arya asks him to take her to Riverrun, he replies that he will take three lives for her, nothing more, and gives her some time to decide whom to kill. Then, he leaves before she can even light her candle.\n\nThe next morning, Arya yawns in Weese\xe2\x80\x99s presence, and he warns her not to let her mouth drop open again, telling her he will feed her tongue to his bitch, and twists her ear to make certain she heard. As she works, she thinks of whom she wants dead, and that, being at war, she should try to kill as many Lannisters as she could, but her father personally killed those he condemned to death. She is not sure she should trust Jaqen, and avoids him for a while, which is not hard to do.\n\nSer Gregor returns, and Weese sends Arya to see if they have clothes that need mending. She arrives to find Chiswyck talking, and does not want to interrupt because she might be hit. He is talking about when he was returning from the [[Tourney of the Hand]] with Ser Gregor, Raff, [[Joss Stilwood]], and [[Eggon]]. They stopped at an alehouse where the brewer did not stop talking. They knew better than to talk because the Mountain was seething over the joust with the [[Knight of Flowers]]. The brewer\xe2\x80\x99s girl was serving, and they were touching her. Finally, Joss put his hand up her skirt, and she screamed, running to the kitchen. The brewer went to Ser Gregor and asked that his men leave the girl alone. Ser Gregor had the girl brought before him, payed the brewer a silver, and raped her right there.Her brother ran in from the cellar and Raff stabbed him with a dirk. After Ser Gregor was done, [[Tobbot]] and Chiswyck continued to rape her. Ser Gregor told the brewer the girl was not worth a silver, and demanded change, and the brewer gave it to him. They all roar with laughter at the story while Arya sneaks away. When Weese learns she did not ask about the mending, he beats her bloody.\n\nTwo days later she sees Jaqen H\xe2\x80\x99ghar in the Barracks Hall. Ensuring that Weese is not around, she works her way down to him filling wine cups until she reaches him and whispers \xe2\x80\x9cChiswyck\xe2\x80\x9d in his ear. He gives no sign that he heard, and nothing happens until the third day, when she hears that a man fell off the wallwalk the previous night. Some are saying Harren\xe2\x80\x99s ghost flung him down and Arya thinks that she is the ghost in Harrenhal and there is one less name on her list.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n*Summary and analyses of the chapter [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2011/11/re-read-arya-vii-wish-unfairy.html in the course of a 10th reread].\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/04/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-14 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 30]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Arya Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Harrenhal]]\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 30]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 31, Arya]]</text>\n      <sha1>6zpuw4gvo0xc8rdl5a1wlrlwgkpm3cx</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Game of Thrones-Chapter 65</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6026</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166007</id>\n      <parentid>117150</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-17T14:58:33Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8702">{{Infobox Chapter AGoT\n| pov\t\t= [[Arya Stark]]\n| place         = [[King\'s Landing]]\n| title\t\t= Arya V\n| page\t\t= 599\n| previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 64|Daenerys VIII]]\n| current\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 65|Arya V]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 66|Bran VII]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 50|Arya IV]]\n| arc next\t= \n}} __NOTOC__\n    \n[[Arya Stark|Arya]] is surviving on the streets of [[King\'s Landing]] by hunting pigeons. When she hears the summoning bells, she joins the crowd to watch [[Eddard Stark|her father]] confess his treason. Once the confession is done, King [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] demands his head. Arya attempts to get to him, but [[Yoren]] of the [[Night\'s Watch]] stops her. Afterward, he declares that she is coming with him.\n\n==Synopsis==    \n[[Arya Stark|Arya]] is catching pigeons on the Street of Flour. Compared with catching cats, pigeons are easy. She uses her wooden practice sword to knock one from the air and snaps its neck.\n\nAfter taking the pigeon, Arya walks by a cart filled with tarts. When she asks for one, she is charged three coppers she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have. The man also declines to trade for her pigeon. Arya uses the seeing taught by [[Syrio Forel]] and decides she could steal one and get away, but the seller guesses her intention and points out the two [[City Watch of King\'s Landing|gold cloaks]] close by. Even though they are paying her no attention, the sight of the gold cloaks ties Arya\'s stomach in knots and she lets the man pass.\n\nAt the [[Red Keep]], which she avoids, Arya can see the heads rotting on spikes. There are all sorts of stories among the smallfolk: Lord [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]] killed King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] and fled, or the king died hunting a boar, or the king died \'\'eating\'\' a boar, or the king was poisoned by [[Varys]] or by the [[Cersei Lannister|queen]]. The stories only agree that the king is dead.\n\nArya wants to leave [[King\'s Landing]], but the seven city gates are either closed completely, open only to entering, or closely guarded by [[House Lannister|Lannister]] guardsmen and gold cloaks, who search everything and ask questions. Once she considered swimming the river, but the current is treacherous and she cannot afford a ferry or a ship. Arya imagines that if she can escape to the countryside, she can dig for roots, find orchards, pick berries, and travel north.\n\nThere are pot shops in [[Flea Bottom]] where she can get her birds cooked or exchanged for some bread or stew, but the people in them seem dangerous. Arya has even been chased a couple of times when leaving, probably for her boots or cloak, but she outran them. She often goes hungry rather than endure the stares of the people in the pot shops. The first night she spent on the street, her silver bracelet and her bundle of good clothes were stolen while she slept. All the thieves left her were the clothes and cloak she was wearing, her practice sword, and her real sword \xe2\x80\x9c[[Needle]],\xe2\x80\x9d which she was sleeping on. \n\nShe misses her brothers. She tried to talk to the other children, but must have talked wrong (likely with a [[Northmen|northern]] accent) because the young ones all ran away and the older ones asked questions, called her names, or tried to steal from her. One girl, twice her age, even knocked her down to try to steal her boots and was rewarded with a smack from Arya\'s practice sword.\n\nOn her daily circuit to check the city gates, Arya decides to go to the riverfront on her way to the [[River Gate|Mud Gate]] to see if she might be able to stow away on a ship. The wharfs are too quiet. On a pier she sees men in the livery of [[Winterfell]] guarding a ship. She learns from a passing longshoreman that the ship is called the \'\'[[Wind Witch]]\'\' out of [[Myr]], which is the same ship that her father contracted to take her and [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] home. As she approaches the ship, Arya suddenly remembers to use the seeing that Syrio taught her again and realizes she does not know the guards. They call to her and she plays the part of a boy trying to sell them the pigeon, knowing they will recognize her if she runs. The ploy works and they send her away dismissively.\n\n[[File:Joffs justice Arya POV by cabepfir.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Eddard Stark\xe2\x80\x99s confession - \xc2\xa9 Cecilia Latella]]\n\nSomehow, Arya finds her way back to Flea Bottom and discovers her pigeon is gone, either stolen or dropped. Then she hears the bells of [[Sept of Baelor|Baelor\'s Sept]] and wonders what it means this time. From one of the passersby she hears that it is a summoning and from another she hears that the gold cloaks are carrying the [[Hand of the King]] to the sept. \n\nArya follows the masses. All around her the townsfolk are discussing [[Eddard Stark|her father]] and the rumors of his treason. She pushes through the crowd and finds herself next to the statue of [[Baelor I Targaryen|Baelor the Blessed]], the [[Faith of the Seven#Septon|Septon]] King, and climbs up so she can see. From this vantage point she can see her father supported by two gold cloaks in a rich velvet doublet and a grey cloak, his face drawn with pain and thinner than Arya has ever seen. With him on the pulpit are the [[High Septon (Fat One)|High Septon]], King [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], Queen [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]], [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]], four other members of the [[Kingsguard]], [[Varys]], [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]], and [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]]; Arya wonders why Sansa is there and why she looks so happy.\n\nThen her father makes a speech in which he confesses that he betrayed the trust of King Robert. A stone from the crowd strikes him, causing a gash on his face and more stones follow. The High Septon intones that Blessed Baelor taught mercy along with justice and asks Joffrey for his verdict. Joffrey declares that his mother and his betrothed have requested that Lord Eddard be allowed to [[Night\'s Watch|take the black]]. Then he declares that while he is king treason shall never go unpunished, and calls for Ser [[Ilyn Payne]] to bring him Eddard\xe2\x80\x99s head. This causes an uproar around Joffrey as the High Septon, Cersei, and even Varys protest the decree.\n\n[[File:Ned\'s execution.jpg|thumb|350px|right|\xe2\x80\x9dBring me his head!\xe2\x80\x9d ([[Game of Thrones|TV series]])]]\n\nArya jumps to the ground, drawing Needle, but the crowd quickly engulfs her. She sees Ser Ilyn raise [[Ice]]\xe2\x80\x94he has Ice!\xe2\x80\x94and hears Sansa screaming. She continues to fight toward them, using Needle to cut a path. A hand shoots out to grab her and hold her tight, forcing her to drop her sword. The smelly old man who has grabbed her tells her not to look and calls her a boy. Then she hears a soft sighing noise.\n\nArya looks at the smelly man and recognizes him as [[Yoren]] of the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch, who talked with her father. He tells her to keep her mouth shut and that she is coming with him. Yoren shakes her hard when she tries to speak. Once the crowd starts to disperse, he hands her back Needle, saying that he hopes she can use it. He keeps calling her a boy and does not give her the opportunity to deny it, insisting that she is trying to say she is not a smart boy.\n\nYoren shoves her inside a doorway and a blade flashes at Arya\xe2\x80\x99s face; she wrenches back her head but cannot escape because Yoren has a strong grip on her hair.\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Arya Stark]]\n*[[Horas Redwyne]]\n*[[Hobber Redwyne]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n*[[High Septon (Fat One)|High Septon]]\n*[[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n*[[Cersei Lannister]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Sandor Clegane]]\n*[[Varys]]\n*[[Petyr Baelish]]\n*[[Sansa Stark]]\n*[[Ilyn Payne]]\n*[[Yoren]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n*[[Renly Baratheon]]\n*[[Bran Stark]]\n*[[Jon Snow]]\n*[[Rickon Stark]]\n*[[Nan]]\n*[[Syrio Forel]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Jeyne Poole]]\n*[[Baelor I Targaryen]]\n*[[Catelyn Tully|Catelyn Stark]]\n|}\n\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/11/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-31 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/066/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 65]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Arya Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in King\'s Landing]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Great Sept of Baelor]]\n\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 65]]\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 66, Arya]]\n[[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\x90\xd1\x80\xd1\x8c\xd1\x8f V]]</text>\n      <sha1>ixjj8c5xk7dndp8vozhh59awtga1ugv</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 8</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6814</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>181382</id>\n      <parentid>166536</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-02-28T21:36:33Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3360">{{Infobox Chapter ADwD\n| pov\t\t= [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n| place         = [[Ghoyan Drohe]]\n| title\t\t= Tyrion III\n| page\t\t= 112\n| previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 7|Jon II]]\n| current\t= Tyrion III\n| next\t\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 9|Davos I]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 5|Tyrion II]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 14|Tyrion IV]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\nAs dawn breaks [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] awakes to find the litter has stopped. He meets [[Haldon]] Halfmaester and Ser [[Rolly Duckfield]], who take on supplies from [[Illyrio]] before leaving with Tyrion. Illyrio tells them the dwarf\'s name is Yollo, although Tyrion, misliking the name, claims it is his name in [[Pentos]] and his name is Hugor Hill. The pair tease Tyrion with tales of river [[pirates]] and the [[Shrouded Lord]]. Tyrion and Haldon test each others\' book knowledge while Duck recounts the events that led to his knighting at the hands of [[Griff]] and his unusual name. They ride until they reach the [[Little Rhoyne]] at [[Ghoyan Drohe]], where a poleboat, the \'\'[[Shy Maid]],\'\' is waiting for them.\n\nOn board are the boy, [[Young Griff]], and his father, Griff. The older man reads a letter sent to him by [[Illyrio]], telling of Tyrion\'s murder of his father. Griff is mistrustful and Tyrion is convinced he is no ordinary [[sellsword]] - he can read, and he is a [[knight]], having knighted Duck himself. Tyrion promises to serve [[Daenerys Targaryen]] faithfully, but asks &quot;What if we should find the queen and discover that this talk of dragons was just some sailor\'s drunken fancy? This wide world is full of such mad tales. Grumkins and snarks, ghosts and ghouls, mermaids, rock goblins, winged horses, winged pigs...winged lions.&quot; Griff tells him to guard his tongue or lose it.\n\n==Character list==\n{{columns|6|\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Illyrio Mopatis]]\n*[[Haldon]]\n*[[Rolly Duckfield]]\n*[[Griff]]\n*[[Young Griff]]\n\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Motho]]\n*[[Zekko]]\n*[[Pono]]\n*[[Serwyn]]\n*[[Urrax]]\n*[[Vhagar]]\n*[[Byron Swann]]\n*[[Syrax]]\n*[[Munkun]]\n*[[Rhaenyra Targaryen]]\n*[[Aegon II Targaryen]]\n*[[Aemond Targaryen]]\n*[[Lemore]]\n*[[Serra]]\n*[[Urho]]\n*[[Korra]]\n*[[Cersei Lannister]]\n*[[Shrouded Lord]]\n*[[Lann the Clever]]\n*[[Lord Caswell]]\n*[[Lorent Caswell]]\n*[[Harry Strickland]]\n*[[Lomas Longstrider]]\n*[[Gerion Lannister]]\n*[[Tywin Lannister]]\n*[[Joanna Lannister]]\n*[[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n*[[Jaime Lannister]]\n*[[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n*[[Ysilla]]\n}}\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{columns|6|\n*[[Ghoyan Drohe]]\n*[[Dothraki]]\n*[[Dagger Lake]]\n*[[khalasar]]\n*[[Forest of Qohor]]\n*[[Qohor]]\n*[[Selhoru]]\n*[[Rhoyne]]\n*[[Pentos]]\n*[[Dance of the Dragons]]\n*[[The Dance of the Dragons, A True Telling]]\n*[[Storm\'s End]]\n*[[Westeros]]\n*[[Hag\xe2\x80\x99s Teeth|Hag\'s Teeth]]\n*[[King\'s Landing]]\n*[[Casterly Rock]]\n*[[Bitterbridge]]\n*[[The Reach]]\n*[[Golden Company]]\n*[[Wonders]]\n*[[Wonders Made by Man]]\n*[[Free Cities]]\n*[[House Lannister]]\n*[[Little Rhoyne]]\n*[[Trident]]\n*[[Shy Maid]]\n*[[Dorne]]\n*[[Tyrosh]]\n*[[House Targaryen]]\n*[[Volantis]]\n}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 08]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Tyrion Lannister]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in the Velvet Hills]]\n\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 8]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 09, Tyrion]]</text>\n      <sha1>tsu6xeq2o4ltxpat83xijcv43s0hv4z</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Clash of Kings-Chapter 17</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6154</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>177787</id>\n      <parentid>166420</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-12-23T16:21:28Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Nittanian</username>\n        <id>3504</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13623">{{Infobox Chapter ACfK\n| pov\t\t= [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n| place         = [[King\'s Landing]] - [[Red Keep]]\n| title\t\t= Tyrion IV\n| page\t\t= 192\n| previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 16|Bran II]]\n| current\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 17|Tyrion IV]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 18|Sansa II]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 15|Tyrion III]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 20|Tyrion V]]\n}}\n\n[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] meets with [[Grand Maester]] [[Pycelle]], [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]], and [[Varys]] in turn, and gives each a secret plan. To Pycelle, he gives a secret letter for Prince [[Doran Martell]]; to Littlefinger, a plan to give [[Lysa Arryn]] her [[Jon Arryn|husband]]\'s killer and wed Princess [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]] to [[Robert Arryn]]; and to [[Varys]], a plan to give Prince [[Doran Martell]] his [[Elia Martell|sister]]\'s killer and Prince [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] as a ward.\n\n==Synopsis==\nDuring breakfast, [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] asks [[Grand Maester]] [[Pycelle]] to send his serving girl away and hands him two sealed copies of a secret letter for Prince [[Doran Martell]]. He insists Pycelle send his swiftest birds immediately; breakfast will keep, but the realm may not with Lord [[Renly Baratheon]] leading his host up the [[roseroad]], and no one knowing when Lord [[Stannis Baratheon]] will sail from [[Dragonstone]]. Pycelle moves ponderously to obey, and Tyrion notes that his [[maester]]\'s chain is far more ornate than the standard. \n\n[[File:Mad4gamestyle Insidious Ways.JPG|thumb|280px|left|Tyrion inspects Pycelle\'s potions- by Tiziano Baracchi\xc2\xa9]]\n\nTyrion has plenty of time to finish part of his breakfast before he sees the ravens take off. He then inspects Pycelle\'s well-organized potions and steals a small bottle from the high shelf. He is back eating when the maester returns to inquire about the message, but Tyrion insists it is best kept a secret. When Pycelle suggests bringing the matter to the [[small council]], Tyrion replies that the council exists to advise King [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], who is only thirteen. When ascked about the queen, Tyrion replies that [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] carries a great weight already and Pycelle reluctantly agrees it is best not to add to her burden, given the frailty of her sex. Tyrion wonders what [[Eddard Stark]] would think of that description, but says nothing and asks to be informed secretly when a reply comes from [[Dorne]]. As he departs, Tyrion thinks to himself, \'\'One\'\'.\n\nIn the lower bailey, Tyrion finds [[Bronn]] (who is now armored as befits his role as captain of the [[Hand of the King|Hand]]\'s guard) watching the men-at-arms practice. He jokingly notes that Bronn is paying no attention to a pair of pretty serving girls. Bronn replies that he can buy all the sex he wants, but one day his vigilance could save his life. He points out that the [[hedge knight]] named Ser [[Tallad]] is the best, but he falls into a rhythm that will be his death when he faces Bronn.\n\nAs they cross the bailey, Bronn informs Tyrion that thirty supplicants await him, including Lady [[Tanda Stokeworth]]\'s page with an invitation to supper. Lady Tanda thinks Tyrion would be the prefect consort for her soft, dimwitted daughter [[Lollys Stokeworth|Lollys]] and is plying him with food; Tyrion tells Bronn to send his regrets. There is also a moneylender from [[Braavos]] wanting repayment of a loan; Tyrion orders him directed to [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]], who will find a way to put him off. Another supplicant is a minor lordling from the [[Trident]] who wants recompense for the destruction done to his land. Seeing the value of a compliant [[Riverlands|river lord]], Tyrion promises to make time for him tomorrow and orders him given good quarters, a meal, and new boots courtesy of King Joffrey. There are also many food merchants who want protection from the hungry mobs who recently roasted a baker in his own oven for overcharging. Tyrion suggests [[City Watch of King\'s Landing|gold cloaks]], but Bronn notes there were gold cloaks in the mob, and the merchants demand to see the king. Tyrion calls them fools since Joffrey would send them off with whips and spears. Bronn also reports that Ser [[Alliser Thorne]] of the [[Night\'s Watch]] has arrived with a rotten hand. Tyrion recalls his distaste for the man, and orders him given a dirty cell and left waiting.\n\nAfter Bronn departs to carry out his orders, Tyrion encounters Cersei and her retinue by the main gate. When he asks where she is going, Cersei claims she is going to inspect the defenses in light of Renly marching from [[Highgarden]]. She believes he could arrive by the full moon, but Tyrion assures her that Renly is traveling too slowly and stopping to feast and hold court at a different castle each night. Tyrion is dubious that Renly actually has the rumored 100,000 men, but Cersei snaps that he has all the power of [[Storm\'s End]] and Highgarden; only [[House Redwyne]] has held back, and that is thanks to her taking the twins [[Horas Redwyne|Horas]] and [[Hobber Redwyne|Hobber]] captive. Tyrion retorts that it is a shame she let Ser [[Loras Tyrell]] slip away, and points out Renly has [[Robb Stark]] at [[Riverrun]] and [[Tywin Lannister]] at [[Harrenhal]] to concern him. He adds that he would do the same as Renly: progress slowly, flaunt his power, watch, and wait. If Robb defeats Tywin, the south will fall into Renly\'s hands like a windfall, and if Tywin defeats Robb, Renly can attack the weakened Lannister host. Cersei demands Tyrion make their father bring his army to King\'s Landing, but Tyrion points out he has never been able to make Lord Tywin do anything. Ignoring this answer, she asks what he is doing to free [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]], who is worth a hundred of Tyrion. Tyrion quips that they do not have a hundred of him to trade to [[Catelyn Stark]]. Angered, Cersei declares him worse than useless and leaves. \n\nIn truth, Tyrion fears Stannis twice as much as Renly; Renly is beloved but inexperienced in war, while Stannis is cold, hard, and inexorable. The spies sent to Dragonstone are ominously silent, though [[Lysene]] war galleys have been spotted and [[Varys]] reports [[sellsail]] captains taking service with Dragonstone. If Stannis and Renly attack together by sea and land there will be no chance for Joffrey, or himself.\n\n[[Podrick Payne]] meets him at the door of his solar and shyly informs him that Petyr Baelish is inside. He finds Littlefinger seated by the window, watching Joffrey kill hares with his new crossbow in the yard below. Observing Joffrey\'s poor aim, Littlefinger quips that the hares are winning and advises Pod to invest in pots since the castle will soon be overrun with hares and they will be eating potted hare for every meal. Tyrion dismisses Pod and offers Littlefinger refreshment. Littlefinger politely declines, noting that he has heard to drink with Tyrion is to risk being sent to the Wall.\n\n[[File:Mark Evans Littlefinger.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Littlefinger - by Mark Evans \xc2\xa9FFG]]\n\nTyrion compliments Littlefinger on his clothing and notes his [[Valyrian steel]] dagger with the [[dragonbone]] hilt. There is mischief in Littlefinger\'s eyes when he responds that is a trifle plain and offers it to Tyrion as a gift. Tyrion refuses, infuriated that Littlefinger knows why he mentioned the dagger and is mocking him because he thinks Tyrion cannot touch him. Tyrion reflects that his brother Jaime is famous for his gilded steel armor, but if ever a man truly armored himself in gold it is Littlefinger. Ten years ago, [[Jon Arryn]] gave him a minor position in customs, where he soon tripled the revenue. Within three years he was master of coin, and now the crown\'s revenues are ten times what they were. The crown\'s debts have grown vast, too, but Littlefinger is a master juggler and borrows so he can put the gold to work. He invests in wagons, shops, ships, houses, agribusiness, textiles, and moneylending, and the [[currency|gold dragons]] breed and multiply. At the same time, Littlefinger moved his own men into place:, the [[King\'s Counter]], the [[King\'s Scales]], all four [[Keeper of the Keys|Keepers of the Keys]], and the officers managing the three mints are his, as well nine of every ten among as the harbormasters, tax farmers, customs agents, wool factors, toll collectors, pursers, and wine factors. All of them are mostly men of middling birth, lesser lordlings, or even foreigners, but far more capable than the highborns they replaced. No one questioned the appointments because Littlefinger is perceived as harmless without soldiers, holdings, or marriage prospects, yet Tyrion is unsure if he can touch him.\n\nTyrion asks how close Littlefinger was with the [[House Tully|Tully]] children during his fostering at Riverrun. Littlefinger boasts that he took both girl\'s maidenheads, which Tyrion considers a very smooth lie. Tyrion explains that Catelyn and [[Lysa Arryn|Lysa]] would refuse any offer he might make, but they might trust Littlefinger. He adds that he hopes to sway the more tractable Lysa by offering her Jon Arryn\'s true killer. Intrigued, Littlefinger asks who, but Tyrion only says that Lysa would have to understand he only gives gifts to his friends, meaning she must first ally with the Lannisters. Littlefinger points out that Lysa has her own woes, such as the [[Vale mountain clans]], who are now more aggressive and better armed thanks to Tyrion. Tyrion promises to use his influence to call off the clansmen if Lysa declares for Joffrey. Littlefinger insists Lysa will never make war on the Starks or Tullys, but Tyrion assures him Lysa\'s power would only be used to oppose Renly or Stannis. In return, Tyrion will give her justice, peace, name her son [[Warden of the East]], and wed his niece Princess [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]] to little Lord [[Robert Arryn]].\n\nLittlefinger asks what Cersei thinks of the ploy, and laughs when Tyrion only shrugs. Then, Littlefinger asks what his reward will be, and Tyrion promises him Harrenhal and supremacy over the [[riverlands]] as their [[Lord Paramount of the Trident|liege lord]]. Littlefinger\'s reaction amuses Tyrion; by birth he holds only a few stoney acres on the [[Fingers]], but Harrenhal is one of the realm\'s richest domains. Littlefinger is suspicious, especially considering that [[Janos Slynt]] also received Harrenhal for his good service, but Tyrion assures him that he is more valuable than Slynt. Appeased, Littlefinger notes that he will likely have to bed Lysa again to get her consent and asks for a fortnight to prepare. As Littlefinger departs, Tyrion thinks to himself, \'\'Two\'\'. \n\n[[File:MarcSimonetti Varys the spider.jpg|thumb|340px|right|Varys - by Marc Simonetti\xc2\xa9]]\n\nNext, Tyrion heads to his bedchamber to await Varys. An hour later, [[Galt]] announces the eunuch\'s arrival, much sooner than Tyrion expected. Varys quips that Tyrion was cruel to taunt Pycelle with a secret, but Tyrion accuses Varys of the same thing and offers to tell him. Varys suggests his little birds may have already told him: Tyrion hopes to dissuade [[Dorne]] from joining another faction, even though Prince Doran\'s hatred for House Lannister is well known. Tyrion points out that much is obvious.\n\nVarys notes that Prince Doran is a sentimental man who still mourns his murdered sister [[Elia Martell|Elia]]. Tyrion reveals he has offered Doran a council seat and his sister\'s killer. Varys points out that Ser [[Gregor Clegane]] (who is known to have murdered Elia) is a Lannister bannerman, but Tyrion argues that Lord Tywin will agree 50,000 Dornishmen are worth one rabid dog. When Varys wonders aloud what might happen if Doran demands the blood of the lord who gave the command as well, Tyrion blames Robert Baratheon since it was his rebellion. Varys points out Robert was not at King\'s Landing, but Tyrion replies that neither was Doran Martell.\n\nVarys notes that Doran will want a token of good faith as well, and asks who Tyrion will offer. Tyrion turns the question back on Varys, who declares it must be [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] since Tyrion cannot offer Myrcella to Doran Martell and Lysa Arryn both. Varys\' uncanny knowledge leads Tyrion to quip that he cheats at guessing games. Varys calls Tommen a good boy, and Tyrion comments that he might even grow into a good man if they get him away from Cersei and Joffrey soon enough. Varys acts suspicious that Tyrion might mean to make Tommen king, but Tyrion insists Joffrey is king. Varys points out there is a flaw in the scheme named Cersei, who will never consent to part with both Tommen \'\'and\'\' Myrcella. Tyrion says what Cersei does not know will not hurt him. When Varys asks what will happen if she does learn of it, Tyrion declares that he would know the man who told her to be his certain enemy. When Varys giggles at that, Tyrion thinks to himself, \'\'Three\'\'.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n*Analyses and summary of the chapter [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2011/08/re-read-tyrion-iv-one-two-three.html in the course of a 10th reread] by Slynt.\xc2\xa0\n*[http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2010/08/bran-tyrion.html Humorous review and summary of the chapter] by Jason.\xc2\xa0\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/02/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-8 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 17]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Tyrion Lannister]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 18, Tyrion]]</text>\n      <sha1>nmnpfnsj3pqb7yavv7du9h8g540ki57</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 50</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6887</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>193603</id>\n      <parentid>193231</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-09-24T21:15:59Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7011">{{Infobox Chapter ADwD\n| pov\t\t= [[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n| place         = [[Meereen]]\n| title\t\t= Daenerys VIII\n| page\t\t= 661\n| previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 49|Jon X]]\n| current\t= Daenerys VIII\n| next\t\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 51|Theon I]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 43|Daenerys VII]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 52|Daenerys IX]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Hizdahr zo Loraq|Hizdahr]] holds a feast in [[Meereen]] with the [[Yunkai|Yunkish]] lords and sellsword captains in attendance, to sign the peace and celebrate the imminent reopening of the [[fighting pits]]. However, the sellswords and slaves from Yunkai and its allies are still besieging Meereen. Just as in Meereen, the [[bloody flux]] has been affecting the Yunkish troops as well. \n\nDaenerys is upset that the Yunkai\'i are holding a slave market just outside the city, but [[Hizdahr zo Loraq|Hizdahr]] tells her it is only for a time and to let them have their show and they will have their peace, with Yunkai keeping their slave trade and Meereen remaining out of it. \n\nThe Yunkai\'i have brought representatives of the four sellsword companies serving them: the [[Tattered Prince]] for the [[Windblown]], [[Gylo Rhegan]] for the [[Long Lances]], [[Bloodbeard]] for the [[Company of the Cat]] and [[Brown Ben Plumm]] for the [[Second Sons]].&lt;ref&gt;We learned back in [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 36|Chapter 36]] that the Second Sons have deserted Daenerys for Yunkai&lt;/ref&gt;  Daenerys is relieved by [[Daario Naharis|Daario]]\'s absence, since she knows that he would be furious with Plumm.\n\nAn exchange of seven hostages has been arranged in order to ensure a measure of peace during the cerimonies. The four sellsword captains and the three Yunkish nobles present [[Yurkhaz zo Yunzak]], Supreme Commander, and two others) are understood to be Daenerys\' hostages for the time being, while Daenerys offers seven of her own to the Yunkish siege camp in exchange (Hizdar\'s sister, two of his cousins, her bloodrider [[Jhogo]], her admiral [[Groleo]], her [[Unsullied]] captain [[Hero]] and Daario Naharis).\n\n[[Skahaz mo Kandaq]] the Shavepate is absent as well, having been replaced as commander of the [[Brazen Beasts]] by Hizdahr zo Loraq\'s cousin, [[Marghaz zo Loraq]].&lt;ref&gt;Page 663&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nWere he not a hostage, Daario might be causing trouble. He is unhappy about Dany\'s wedding to Hizdahr, and he got furious when [[Quentyn Martell]] revealed that his group of [[Westeros]]i Windblowns had been ordered to &quot;defect&quot; to Meereen.&lt;ref&gt;The order was given in [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 25|Chapter 25]] and executed in [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 36|Chapters 36]] [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 43|and 43]]&lt;/ref&gt; Daario nearly slew them all in his rage, but [[Grey Worm]] intervened and stopped him, choosing instead to imprison the group of Windblowns.\n\nBrown Ben comes up to her and explains his defection, saying that it is natural for sellswords to change sides if they believe that it will improve their odds of survival. He claims that the Second Sons were troubled when they learned that Daenerys could not use her dragons to help fight the Yunkish forces. After he leaves, she asks Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] his opinion, as he was hiding and listening as always. He advises her that Brown Plumm is quite truthful, and confirms that it is not wise to place trust in a sellsword.\n\nSeeking ways to make up for the loss of the Second Sons, Dany asks Ser Barristan about the possibility of finding a rival leader in the group that might want to &quot;remove&quot; Brown Ben Plumm. Barristan thinks it possible, but doesn\'t know for certain. She then mentions the other three mercenary companies, prompting Barristan to offer to arrange a meeting with Gylo Rhegan or the Tattered Prince if she wants so. Dany says that this is not the time or the place as there are too many watchful eyes about. Barristan admits that he is not the best man for such work, and that back in Westeros, it would have been [[Littlefinger]] or [[Varys|the Spider]] to have done this kind of work.\n\nDany\'s mind turns back to the captured Westerosi turncloaks. She realizes that by freeing one of the Windblows she might establish negotiations with their leader, the Tattered Prince, and perhaps sway them to her cause. She first suggests and later commands Ser Barristan to send back the woman [[Meris]] as a gesture of her regard, knowing that their captain will get the message. She wants to contact the Long Lances and the Company of the Cat as well. Barristan advises against dealing with Bloodbear of the Company of the Cat, however; he says that he reminds him of the [[Band of Nine|Ninepenny Kings]], that he is much too greedy and much too dishonourable to be an asset. Daenerys feels that such men might be the easiest to sway, but decides to trust his counsel on this matter.&lt;ref&gt;Page 667&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nShe then summons Quentyn to speak further, at Ser Barristan\'s suggestion. He still believes that the Dornish envoys are their best option for returning to Westeros, though Dany will not abandon her city. She speaks with him and brings him to the dragon pit to see her &quot;children&quot;. She introduces Quentyn to [[Viserion]] and [[Rhaegal]], telling him that [[Drogon]] is away hunting, and that she is a dragon as well. Dany gives Quentyn another piece of advice to leave Meereen, saying that he is not safe here, that men like Daario and Hizdahr could see him as a threat and eliminate him. He boldly, perhaps foolishly, declines.\n\nDany then retires to bed where Hizdahr is waiting for her, drunk and lustful. She allows him to have his way with her before he passes out. [[Missandei]] comes in and hears that the queen is unhappy and comforts her, talking of her home [[Naath]]. Eventually Daenerys falls asleep, though she dreads the morrow, when the fighting pits will reopen, and blood will be spilled.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n* [[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n* [[Hizdahr zo Loraq]]\n* [[Daario Naharis]]\n* [[Rakharo]]\n* [[Barsena Blackhair]]\n* [[Khrazz]]\n* [[Spotted Cat]]\n* [[Goghor the Giant]]\n* [[Belaquo Bonebreaker]]\n* [[Doreah]]\n* [[Quaro]]\n* [[Eroeh]]\n* [[Hazzea]]\n* [[Yurkhaz zo Yunzak]]\n* [[Aegon I Targaryen]]\n* [[Tattered Prince]]\n* [[Gylo Rhegan]]\n* [[Bloodbeard]]\n* [[Jhogo]]\n* [[Brown Ben Plumm]]\n* [[Groleo]]\n* [[Hero | Hero (unsullied)]]\n* [[Skahaz mo Kandaq]]\n* [[Marghaz zo Loraq]]\n* [[Green Grace]]\n* [[Quentyn Martell]]\n* [[Grey Worm]]\n* [[Yurkhaz zo Yunzak]]\n* [[Barristan Selmy]]\n* [[Littlefinger]]\n* [[Varys]]\n* [[Meris]]\n* [[Quaithe]]\n* [[Lewyn Martell]]\n* [[Nymeria]]\n* [[Daeron II Targaryen]]\n* [[Daenerys Targaryen (daughter of Aegon IV)]]\n* [[Irri]]\n* [[Jhiqui]]\n* [[Mirri Maz Duur]]\n* [[Missandei]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 50]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Daenerys Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Meereen]]\n\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 51, Daenerys]]</text>\n      <sha1>a0yn93t3e8zciufl7flfdh2fnopb059</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 9</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6815</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>173232</id>\n      <parentid>166539</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-09-09T20:42:27Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Nittanian</username>\n        <id>3504</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <minor/>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4777">{{Infobox Chapter ADwD\n| pov\t\t= [[Davos Seaworth]]\n| place         = [[Sisterton]]\n| title\t\t= Davos I\n| page\t\t= 123\n| previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 8|Tyrion III]]\n| current\t= Davos I\n| next\t\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 10|Jon III]]\n| arc previous\t= \n| arc next\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 15|Davos II]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File\xe2\x80\x8e: \xe2\x80\x8eMarc_Fishman_davos_sweetsister.jpg\xe2\x80\x8e|Davos on [[Sweetsister]] - by Marc Fishman \xc2\xa9 |thumb|350px|left]]\nIn the middle of a storm, [[Davos Seaworth|Davos]] is marched before [[Godric Borrell]], Lord of [[Sweetsister]], in his castle [[Breakwater]] at [[Sisterton]]. He was captured by Borrell\'s men while trying to find passage off the island to [[White Harbor]]. [[Salladhor Saan]]\'s fleet had been smashed by storms since heading south from the [[Wall]], until Saan, frustrated by [[Stannis Baratheon]]\'s continual inability to make good on his promises, abandoned his cause, leaving his old friend Davos on Sweetsister after Davos refused to journey south with him. Davos conceals this fact from Borrell, telling him that Saan has traveled south to raid the Lannisters at Stannis\' command. Borell informs Davos that [[Lysa Arryn]] is dead - and [[Tywin Lannister]], at the hand of [[Tyrion Lannister|his dwarf son]]. We also learn that a shipload of [[House Frey|Frey]]s have reached White Harbor, with its Lord, [[Wyman Manderly]] of White Harbor having pledged his allegiance to [[Tommen Baratheon|King Tommen]]. The news dismays Davos, but he hides his reaction and asks Borrell to help him get to White Harbor.\n\nBorrell tells of his meeting with [[Eddard Stark]] during [[Robert\'s Rebellion]]. Ned was attempting to reach [[Winterfell|Winterfell]] so he could call his banners and join Robert\'s Rebellion, while avoiding [[taking of Gulltown|Gulltown]], which was loyal to [[Aerys II Targaryen|the Mad King]]. Stark had arrived at the [[Three Sisters]] after crossing the mountains to the Fingers, where he convinced a fisherman to carry him to White Harbor. The fisherman drowned during passage, but the fisherman\'s daughter got Ned to The Sisters. Lord Godric asserts that Ned left her with a bag of silver and a bastard son, whom she named [[Jon Snow]], after Arryn. Borrell\'s father decided to let Ned go on his way instead of turning him over to the [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]] after telling Ned &quot;If you lose, you were never here&quot;.\n\nBorrell decides to let Davos go on his way instead of turning him in, just as his father did to Ned Stark. Davos echos the sentiments expressed by Ned Stark and agrees to deny his presence in Sweetsister if Stannis winds up on the losing side of the conflict.\n\n==Character list==\n{{columns|6|\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Davos Seaworth]]\n*[[Godric Borrell]]\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Stannis Baratheon]]\n*[[Blind Bastard]]\n*[[Salladhor Saan]]\n*[[Tommen Baratheon]]\n*[[Melisandre]]\n*[[Triston Sunderland]]\n*[[Rolland Longthorpe]]\n*[[Alesandor Torrent]]\n*[[Lysa Arryn]]\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Littlefinger]]\n*[[Wyman Manderly]]\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Tywin Lannister]]\n*[[Cersei Lannister]]\n*[[Gella]]\n*[[Alester Florent]]\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n*[[Wendel Manderly]]\n*[[Rhaegar Frey]]\n*[[Jeyne Beesbury]]\n*[[Walder Frey]]\n*[[Kevan Lannister]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n*[[Aerys II Targaryen]]\n*[[Jon Arryn]]\n*[[Jon Snow]]\n*[[Marq Grafton]]\n*[[Rhaegar Targaryen]]\n}}\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{columns|7|\n*[[Night Lamp]]\n*[[Breakwater]]\n*[[Dragonstone]]\n*[[Belly of the Whale]]\n*[[Gallows Gate]]\n*[[Sisterton]]\n*[[King\'s Hand]]\n*[[Three Sisters]]\n*[[White Harbor]]\n*[[Sweetsister]]\n*[[The Wall]]\n*[[Oledo]]\n*[[Old Mother\'s Son]]\n*[[Skagos]]\n*[[Saathos Saan]]\n*[[Grey Cliffs]]\n*[[Bountiful Harvest]]\n*[[Widow\'s Watch]]\n*[[Bite]]\n*[[Iron Throne]]\n*[[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]]\n*[[Stepstones]]\n*[[Lys]]\n*[[Andals]]\n*[[Lady of the Waves]]\n*[[Lord of the Skies]]\n*[[House Arryn]]\n*[[The Vale]]\n*[[Eyrie]]\n*[[Longsister]]\n*[[Littlesister]]\n*[[House Lannister]]\n*[[War of the Five Kings]]\n*[[Riverrun]]\n*[[House Flint]]\n*[[Fingers]]\n*[[Valyrian (ship)|Valyrian]]\n*[[Castle Black]]\n*[[King\'s Landing]]\n*[[House Sunderland]]\n*[[Blackfyre Rebellion]]\n*[[House Borrell]]\n*[[Qarth]]\n*[[Volantis]]\n*[[Braavos]]\n*[[House Stark]]\n*[[House Manderly]]\n*[[Mander]]\n*[[Lionstar]]\n*[[House Frey]]\n*[[Winterfell]]\n*[[Casterly Rock]]\n*[[Highgarden]]\n*[[Rape of the Three Sisters]]\n*[[Storm\'s End]]\n*[[House Tyrell]]\n*[[House Redwyne]]\n*[[House Targaryen]]\n*[[Iron Fleet]]\n*[[Fair Isle]]\n*[[House Bolton]]\n*[[Robert\'s Rebellion]]\n*[[Gulltown]]\n}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 09]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Davos Seaworth]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place on Sweetsister]]\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 9]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 10, Davos]]</text>\n      <sha1>ebej35j4rbfh0wypls6x3dk9ss4scq9</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Clash of Kings-Chapter 62</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6230</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>182621</id>\n      <parentid>166465</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-04-04T10:24:54Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Mindset</username>\n        <id>4579</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3046">{{Infobox Chapter ACfK\n| pov\t\t= [[Sansa Stark]]\n| place         = [[King\'s Landing]]\n| title\t\t= Sansa VII\n| page\t\t= 630\n| previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 61|Tyrion XIV]]\n| current\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 62|Sansa VII]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 63|Daenerys V]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 60|Sansa VI]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 65|Sansa VIII]]\n}}\n\n[[File:Sing For Your Little Lifekallielef.png|The Hound demands a song of Sansa - by Kallielef \xc2\xa9|thumb|350px|left]]\n==Synopsis==\nSer [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]] curses [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] for calling [[Joffrey Baratheon|her son]] back inside [[Red Keep#Maegor\'s Holdfast|the Holdfast]], when the king\xe2\x80\x99s presence might have rallied the troops.

In the dream Ghost is aware of the presence of the other stark direwolves [[Nymeria]], [[Shaggydog]] and [[Summer]]. Jon is awakened from the dream by [[Jeor Mormont]]\'s raven. He resides in the old quarters of [[Donal Noye]], since [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] occupies the King\xe2\x80\x99s Tower and the Lord Commander\xe2\x80\x99s Tower has burned down. He reflects that Ghost knows that [[Grey Wind]] is dead, but his other brothers\' wolves are still alive. His wolf dreams are becoming more vivid and more frequent, and he wonders if part of [[Bran Stark|Bran]] and [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]] survive in their wolves.\n\nAs [[Lord Commander of the Night\'s Watch]], Jon heads off to treat with King Stannis, who has requested his presence. As Jon crosses the yard, he gives advice to sparring recruits and is challenged to a duel by Ser [[Godry Farring]], from Stannis\xe2\x80\x99 retinue, but ignores the challenge. On the steps up, he runs into [[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] before finally arriving at the King\'s Tower. \n\nStannis has been unsuccessful in seeking allegiance from the lords of the North; the latest rejection letter is from [[Lyanna Mormont]]. So far, the only house to have declared for him is [[House Karstark]]. Stannis asks for gold from the Night\'s Watch to pay off [[Salladhor Saan]]. Jon recommends he take [[White Harbor]] for that, but Stannis dismisses its lord, [[Wyman Manderly]], as fat and useless. With [[wildling]] refugees still seeking shelter south of the wall, they discuss [[Mance Rayder]], whom Stannis intends to burn as a deserter, his wife\'s sister [[Val]], and his child. Jon mentions that [[Gilly]] is acting as wet nurse for her own child and Mance\'s, and that he plans to send her and her babe away south. Stannis approves once he learns that Gilly\'s child was born of incest.\n\nStannis is demanding lands and castles from the Night\'s Watch. Jon has already ceded land in The Gift, and refuses to let him have the castles. He offers instead to have his own officers man the abandoned forts, to command Stannis\' men as a garrison. Stannis grumbles and threatens Jon before allowing him to leave. [[Melisandre]], the priestess of [[R\'hllor]], follows Jon out from the meeting. Jon is wary of her but she warns him not to refuse her friendship, saying that she has seen him in her visions. Underneath the Wall, she tells him to be wary of foes behind his back and daggers in the dark. Jon assures her he is aware he has enemies in the Watch, to which Melisandre replies \'\'&quot;You know nothing, Jon Snow&quot;\'\'.\n\n==Character list==\n{{columns|5|\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Jon Snow]]\n*[[Edd Tollett]]\n*[[Iron Emmett]]\n*[[Garse]]\n*[[Hareth (Mole\'s Town)|Horse]]\n*[[Hop-Robin]]\n*[[Godry Farring]]\n*[[Samwell Tarly]]\n*[[Melisandre]]\n*[[Stannis Baratheon]]\n*[[Devan Seaworth]]\n\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Jeor Mormont]]\n*[[Hobb]]\n*[[Mance Rayder]]\n*[[Weeper]]\n*[[Tormund Giantsbane]]\n*[[Aemon Targaryen (son of Maekar I)|Aemon]]\n*[[Ghost]]\n*[[Grey Wind]]\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Bran Stark]]\n*[[Rickon Stark]]\n*[[Theon Greyjoy]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n*[[Summer]]\n*[[Shaggydog]]\n*[[Donal Noye]]\n*[[Cotter Pyke]]\n*[[Ygritte]]\n*[[Satin]]\n*[[Dick Follard]]\n*[[Bowen Marsh]]\n*[[Lyanna Mormont]]\n*[[Maege Mormont]]\n*[[Lyanna Stark]]\n*[[Arnolf Karstark]]\n*[[Rickard Karstark]]\n*[[Tywin Lannister]]\n*[[Salladhor Saan]]\n*[[Wyman Manderly]]\n*[[Val]]\n*[[Aemon Steelsong|Wildling prince]]\n*[[Othell Yarwyck]]\n*[[Sansa Stark]]\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Rattleshirt]]\n*[[Sigorn]]\n*[[Gilly]]\n*[[Dalla]]\n*[[Monster|Gilly\'s boy]]\n*[[Craster]]\n*[[Davos Seaworth]]\n*[[Alliser Thorne]]\n*[[Janos Slynt]]\n}}\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{columns|7|\n*[[the Wall]]\n*[[the Twins]]\n*[[Queenscrown]]\n*[[King\'s Tower]]\n*[[Storm\'s End]]\n*[[Mole\'s Town]]\n*[[Queensgate]]\n*[[Oakenshield (Wall)|Oakenshield]]\n*[[Valyrian steel]]\n*[[Longclaw]]\n*[[Castle Black]]\n*[[Hardin\'s Tower]]\n*[[House Baratheon]]\n*[[Thenn (region)|Thenns]]\n*[[Free folk]]\n*[[Dornish Marches]]\n*[[Karhold]]\n*[[the Others]]\n*[[Bear Island]]\n*[[King in the North]]\n*[[House Karstark]]\n*[[House Bolton]]\n*[[Westeros]]\n*[[Night\'s Watch]]\n*[[White Harbor]]\n*[[Oldtown]]\n*[[King\'s Landing]]\n*[[Seven Kingdoms]]\n*[[King-Beyond-the-Wall]]\n*[[Winterfell]]\n*[[Warden of the North]]\n*[[Nightfort]]\n*[[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]]\n*[[Gift]]\n*[[Lightbringer]]\n*[[Lord of Light]]\n}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 03]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Jon Snow]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Castle Black]]\n\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 3]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 04, Jon]]</text>\n      <sha1>32bi9hnu11kbnkyf4a3eco6f3vbvkg8</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Game of Thrones-Chapter 22</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>3859</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>165965</id>\n      <parentid>122966</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-17T14:13:10Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7892">{{Infobox Chapter AGoT\n| pov\t\t= [[Arya Stark]]\n| place         = [[King\'s Landing]]\n| title\t\t= Arya II\n| page\t\t= \n| previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 21|Tyrion III]]\n| current\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 22|Arya II]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 23|Daenerys III]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 7|Arya I]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 32|Arya III]]\n}} __NOTOC__\n\nUnhappy at [[King\'s Landing]], [[Arya Stark|Arya]] abandons her dinner. Her [[Eddard Stark|father]] comes to her room to talk to her and sees she has [[Needle|her sword]] out. After a long talk, he decides not to take the sword away. Several days later, Arya meets her new dancing master.\n\n==Synopsis==\nWhen [[Eddard Stark|her father]] enters the Small Hall after dinner has already begun Arya can tell that he has been fighting with the [[Small Council|council]] again. [[Jory Cassel]] asks about the [[Tourney of the Hand|tourney]] everyone is talking about, and Eddard asks if anyone is talking about the [[Hand of the King|Hand]]\xe2\x80\x99s displeasure with the whole idea.\n\n[[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] is tremendously excited by the prospect of a tourney and begs to be allowed to attend. When [[Septa]] [[Mordane]] mentions his family will be expected to attend, Eddard agrees to ensure that seats are provided for both Sansa and Arya. Knowing that Prince [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] will be there, Arya insists she does not want to attend a stupid tourney. When Sansa taunts that Arya would not be wanted anyway, Eddard loses his temper and threatens to change his mind.\n\nQuickly regaining his composure, Eddard excuses himself. Once he is gone, his guardsmen start talking excitedly about the tourney. No one talks to Arya but she likes it that way. Back in [[Winterfell]] she had enjoyed listening to the men talk, but now the sounds irritate her because she blames them all, even her father, for doing nothing to save [[Lady (direwolf)|Lady]] and [[Mycah]].\n\nAfter looking disgustedly at her cold food and the people around her, Arya pushes away from the table. When Septa Mordane insists that Arya hasn\xe2\x80\x99t eaten, she dashes away. She runs to her chamber and locks herself in. She digs to the bottom of her chest where her sword [[Needle]] is hidden. Arya thinks that if she could climb like her brother [[Bran Stark|Bran]] she could steal some food and run away and that if [[Jon Snow]] was there she would not feel so lonely.\n\nA soft knock on her door proves to be her father, who says they need to talk and asks politely to come in. From the way he talks, Arya is ashamed to realize he is more sad than angry. When she lets him in, her father immediately notices her sword and asks whose it is. Arya explains that it is hers and her father asks to see it. Her father notices [[Mikken]]\xe2\x80\x99s mark on the blade and remarks that if his nine-year-old daughter can be armed from his own forge without his knowledge, how can he be expected to rule the [[Seven Kingdoms]]?\n\n[[File:Mustamirri AryaNedBrandonLyanna.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Arya reminds Ned of his sister Lyanna - \xc2\xa9 mustamirri]]\n\nEddard asks who gave her the sword but Arya stays silent, not wanting to betray Jon. Her father accepts this but tells Arya that a sword is not a toy. When asked what she thinks Septa Mordane would say about her playing with a sword, Arya insists she was not playing. Eddard states that he should break the sword over his knee. Arya responds that \xe2\x80\x9cNeedle wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t break.\xe2\x80\x9d The sword having a name amuses her father, who claims that Arya reminds him of his sister, [[Lyanna Stark|Lyanna]], who might have carried a sword if [[Rickard Stark|their father]] had allowed it. Arya is surprised when Eddard says she looks like her aunt, who was always described as beautiful, something never said of Arya.\n\nEddard asks if Arya knows anything about how to use a sword, and she replies with the advice Jon gave her: \xe2\x80\x9cStick \'em with the pointy end.\xe2\x80\x9d She tells how she was trying to learn and sadly adds that she asked Mycah to practice with her. In grief she starts to sob against her father\xe2\x80\x99s chest. He tells her that Mycah\xe2\x80\x99s death was not her fault.  Arya sobs that she hates them all: the [[Cersei Lannister|Queen]], the Hound, Joffrey, and the King. Then she adds that Joffery lied, and that she also hates Sansa. \n\nEddard says that everyone lies and that he does not believe that [[Nymeria]] ran off. Arya then exclaims that Jory promised not to tell. Eddard informs her that Jory did not tell but that he had figured it out, because even a blind man could tell that the wolf would not have left willingly. Arya then explains how she and Jory had to throw rocks to drive the wolf away. She then asks her father if she did the right thing and Eddard assures her that she did.\n\n[[File:Syrio Forel.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Syrio Forel, Arya\'s new &quot;dancing master&quot; - \xc2\xa9 Amok]]\n\nEddard then tells Arya that winter is coming. He explains to her how wolves stick together, and that in the winter a lone wolf dies. Now there are enemies threatening the [[House Stark|Starks]], so they must stick together like a pack of wolves and it is time for her to start growing up. He hands Arya back her sword, saying she can keep it; he only asks that she not stick her sister. \n\nThree days later, Arya is sent to the Small Hall by the [[Vayon Poole|steward]]. She is met by [[Syrio Forel]], a former [[First Sword of Braavos|First Sword]] of [[Braavos]]. He tells her that he is her dancing master, and throws her a wooden sword, which she cannot catch. Unperturbed, Syrion tells Arya that the next day she will be there at midday and catch the blade. She picks the practice sword up as instructed and finds that it is very heavy. When she complains about the weight, Syrio explains that it is heavy to make her strong. Then he fixes her grip, telling her not to squeeze too tight. When Arya says that she might drop it, Syrio tells her that the sword must become a part of her arm, and that she cannot drop a part of her arm.\n\nWhen Syrio calls her a boy for the third time Arya objects. He insists that it does not matter; a sword has no gender. He then explains that what he will be teaching her is not the hacking and hammering iron dance of [[Westeros]], but the swift and sudden Water Dance of Braavos,. Then he tells her to try to strike him, and she tries unsuccessfully for four hours until every muscle is sore. The next day the real work begins.\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Arya Stark]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n*[[Sansa Stark]]\n*[[Jory Cassel]]\n*Septa [[Mordane]]\n*[[Jeyne Poole]]\n*[[Hullen]]\n*[[Desmond]]\n*[[Jacks]]\n*[[Harwin]]\n*[[Porther]]\n*[[Vayon Poole]]\n*\'\'Fat\'\' [[Tomard|Tom]]\n*[[Syrio Forel]]\n\n| style=&quot;width:33%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n*[[Myrcella Baratheon]]\n*[[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n*[[Bran Stark]]\n*[[Rickon Stark]]\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Jon Snow]]\n*[[Mikken]]\n*Septon [[Chayle]]\n*[[Rodrik Cassel]]\n\n| style=&quot;width:33%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Old Nan]]\n*[[Lady (direwolf)|Lady]]\n*[[Sandor Clegane]]\n*[[Mycah]]\n*[[Alyn]]\n*[[Nymeria (direwolf)|Nymeria]]\n*[[Lyanna Stark]]\n*[[Brandon Stark]]\n|}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2009/05/arya-daenerys.html Humorous review of the chapter]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/06/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-12 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/023/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 22]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Arya Stark|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 22]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 22]]\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 23, Arya]]\n[[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\x90\xd1\x80\xd1\x8c\xd1\x8f II]]</text>\n      <sha1>bungic1cve6y5h4sw4sqpm0xtvbcg78</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 55</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6903</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166632</id>\n      <parentid>108144</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-26T19:18:37Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4487">{{Infobox Chapter ADwD\n| pov\t\t= [[Barristan Selmy]]\n| place         = [[Meereen]]\n| title\t\t= The Queensguard\n| page\t\t= 730\n| previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 54|Cersei I]]\n| current\t= The Queensguard\n| next\t\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 56|The Iron Suitor]]\n| arc previous\t= \n| arc next\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 59|The Discarded Knight]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] has not returned, many fear her dead. The [[Dothraki]] are searching for her across the [[Worm River]]. [[Belwas|Strong Belwas]] is still in mortal danger from the poisoned locusts that he ate during the reopening of the fighting pits,&lt;ref&gt;Probably meant for Daenerys or Hizdahr; Belwas ate the locusts in [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 52|Chapter 52 (Daenerys)]], page 691; and felt the effects on pages 696 and 697&lt;/ref&gt; and Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] does not trust the Blue [[Graces]] that are taking care of him now. [[Jhogo]], [[Daario Naharis]], [[Groleo|Admiral Groleo]], and [[Hero]] of the [[Unsullied]] all remain prisoners of the [[Yunkai\'i]].&lt;ref&gt;Since [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 50|Chapter 50 (Daenerys)]], page 663&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nSer Barristan is told by [[Hizdahr zo Loraq]]\'s seneschal [[Reznak mo Reznak]] that Hizdahr wishes to receive his Yunkish guests without Barristan there, essentially removing the duties of the head of the Queensguard. Of all of Dany\'s servants, only [[Missandei]] remains within the the royal apartments, although she too has been replaced.\n\nThe Unsullied have been slighted by Hizdahr, and the [[Shavepates]] might well be more loyal to [[Skahaz mo Kandaq]] than to Hizdahr, so the king lets himself be defended by pit fighters while he prepares for the peace discussions with the Yunkai\'i.&lt;ref&gt;Pages 730-731&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nMeanwhile, disease&lt;ref&gt;The [[Bloody flux]], also known as the \'\'pale mare\'\'&lt;/ref&gt; has spread throughout [[Meereen]], both in the city itself and among the Yunkishmen camped outside it, despite the best of Dany\'s earlier efforts. Due to this, the streets are extremely quiet. Barristan is in a depressed and reflective state, wondering how he got here, how he lost Dany like he lost her father and brother, as well as [[Robert Baratheon|King Robert]]. He remembers how he ran too slowly after Dany, pondering if Daario would have run faster. As [[Drogon]] took to the air with Dany on his back, spears and crossbow bolts were targeted at him, wounding him. In reply, he loosed his fire upon them, killing two hundred and fourteen people and wounding three times as many.&lt;ref&gt;Pages 732-734&lt;/ref&gt;  Rumor has it that the Yunkai\'i sieging Meereen have mounted scorpions around the city in an attempt at slaying Drogon should he return.&lt;ref&gt;Page 735&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAs he thinks that she may be flying home, Missandei appears behind him. She tells him that Dany would not leave without them. She also says that Skahaz mo Kandaq the Shavepate wishes to meet with him, secretly. Barristan agrees to a meeting at the stables at sunset.  There, the Shavepate says that the [[Sons of the Harpy]] [[poisoned locusts|poisoned the locusts]] that Belwas ate, intending to kill Dany, that [[Volantis]] has dispatched its fleet, and that Hizdahr means to open Meereen\'s gates for them. \n\nSkahaz asks him to speak to [[Grey Worm]], as he will trust Barristan and support them. Selmy agrees to conspire with the Shavepate against Hizdahr, and to attack the unsuspecting Yunkai\'i before the fleet from Volantis can arrive to take the city and enslave all Dany\'s people. He does this on the condition that Hizdahr\'s guilt can be proven and Barristan thinks to himself that he will kill the man personally. Barristan says that he will go speak to Grey Worm.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n* [[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n* [[Belwas]]\n* [[Barristan Selmy]]\n* [[Jhogo]]\n* [[Daario Naharis]]\n* [[Groleo]]\n* [[Hero]]\n* [[Reznak mo Reznak]]\n* [[Missandei]]\n* [[Hizdahr zo Loraq]]\n* [[Skahaz mo Kandaq]]\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n*[[Drogon]]\n*[[Grey Worm]]\n}}\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Dothraki]]\n*[[Yunkai]]\n*[[Unsullied]]\n*[[Meereen]]\n*[[Sons of the Harpy]]\n*[[Volantis]]\n*[[Poisoned locusts]]\n}}\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 55]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Barristan Selmy]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Meereen]]\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 55]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 56, Le garde de la reine]]</text>\n      <sha1>1fnz5q28wkwmtrcuy9awc7eu8pyqmhm</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Feast for Crows-Chapter 18</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5623</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>142436</id>\n      <parentid>141523</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2014-09-22T20:10:38Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Scafloc</username>\n        <id>28</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4234">{{Infobox Chapter AFfC\n| pov\t\t= [[Victarion Greyjoy]] \n| title\t\t= The Iron Captain\n| place         = [[Nagga\'s Cradle]]\n| page\t\t= 255\n| previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 17|Cersei IV]]\n| current\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 18|The Iron Captain]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 19|The Drowned Man]]\n| arc previous\t= \n| arc next\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 29|The Reaver]]\n}}\n\n== Synopsis  ==\n[[Victarion Greyjoy|Victarion]] has left the defense of [[Moat Cailin]] to [[Ralf Kenning]], and sailed the [[Iron Fleet]] to [[Old Wyk]] for the [[kingsmoot]]. When the fleet arrives at [[Nagga\'s Cradle]], Victarion has them blockade [[Euron Greyjoy|Euron]]\'s [[Silence]]. The first to greet him on shore is [[Aeron Greyjoy|Aeron]], and later that night the priest is at his side for the feast. Several captains pledge their voice to Victarion\'s claim, but [[Baelor Blacktyde|Lord Blacktyde]] seeks a king who will end the wars, saying, \n\n::\'\'&quot;[[Balon Greyjoy|Balon]] was mad, Aeron is madder, and Euron is maddest of them all.&quot;\'\'\n\nSoon, the captain finds [[Asha Greyjoy|his niece]], advising her not to lay forth a claim, because a woman has no place ruling the ironborn.  Asha stands by her claim, and notes that the Damphair may have underestimated the appeal of the Kingsmoot, since [[Dunstan Drumm|the Drumm]] will present his claim and there is talk of [[Maron Volmark]] being presented as heir of the throne by [[Tarle|Tarle the Thrice-Drowned]], while it is apparent that Aeron\'s intent was to legitimize Victarion as Balon\'s successor.\n\nTheir chat is interrupted by the arrival of Euron. Victarion notes Euron does not seem to have aged in the almost three years that he has been gone.&lt;ref&gt;Page 293&lt;/ref&gt; Aeron confronts Euron with the accusation that \'\'&quot;no godless man may sit the [[Seastone Chair]]&quot;\'\', but Euron cows his brother into leaving the hall. Asha then accuses her uncle of the death of her father, but Euron denies he had anything to do with it. When a fight nearly breaks out between Asha and one of Euron\'s men, Victarion steps in and demands that Euron leave. After his departure, Victarion and his niece walk outside, and Asha asks why Euron was banished by her father, for he refused to ever speak of it. Victarion eventually tells her that Euron impregnated [[Victarion Greyjoy\'s third wife|Victarion\'s wife]]. Victarion wanted to kill his brother but Balon forbid it and sent Euron to exile. Later Victarion killed his wife with his own hands.\n\nAsha offers to set aside her claim if Victarion will name her his Hand and end the war. She feels that the Ironborn have overextended themselves and tells her uncle that she has reached an agreement with Lady [[Sybelle Locke|Sybelle Glover]], and that their people may keep [[Sea Dragon Point]] and the [[Stony Shore]] in return for the release of [[Deepwood Motte]], [[Torrhen\'s Square]] and [[Moat Cailin]]. Victarion is not receptive. Asha replies that she then will claim the throne.\n\n== Character List  ==\n{| width=&quot;78%&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width: 25px;&quot; | \n*[[Nute]] the Barber \n*Red [[Ralf Stonehouse]] \n*[[Ralf the Limper]] \n*[[Ralf Kenning]] \n*[[Fralegg]] the Strong \n*[[Alvyn Sharp]]\n\n| style=&quot;width: 25px;&quot; | \n*[[Will Humble]] \n*Little [[Lenwood Tawney]] \n*[[Romny Weaver]] \n*[[Eldred Codd]] \n*Lord [[Norne Goodbrother]] \n*[[Euron Greyjoy]]\n\n| style=&quot;width: 25px;&quot; | \n*Lord [[Maron Volmark]] \n*Lord [[Germund Botley]] \n*Lord [[House Orkwood|Orkwood]] \n*The [[Red Oarsman]] \n*[[Torwold Browntooth]] \n*Pinchface [[Jon Myre]]\n\n| style=&quot;width: 25px;&quot; | \n*Left-Hand [[Lucas Codd]] \n*[[Quellon Humble]] \n*[[Qarl the Thrall]]\n*[[Stonehand]] \n*[[Ralf the Shepherd]] \n*[[Ralf of Lordsport]]\n|}\n\n==References and Notes==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/05/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-feast-for-crows-part-13 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Feast for Crows, Part 13].

When his elk died, Coldhands butchered it for food, but all the steaks are gone now and they are all weak from hunger and cold, particularly Jojen. \n\nThey have to make their way up the hill into a cleft - about a thousand yards through thick wood. But the [[Others]] are close by - Coldhand and his ravens can sense them, and an unnatural cold has descended, even as they remain unseen. The ravens urge Bran on so they start up the hill. Meera has to support Jojen\'s weight.\n\nAround eighty yards from the [[cave of the three-eyed crow|cave]] entrance, Summer stops at a steep stretch of unbroken snow. Bran, on Hodor\'s back, knows something is wrong. Coldhands continues to climb so Hodor follows him. He glimpses a fire in the cave entrance when suddenly Hodor trips and falls. A [[wight]] bursts from the snow, grasping his leg. Bran falls from his basket as Hodor and the wight struggle, and soon he is surrounded by dead men emerging from under the snow with pale flesh and black hands. Wights attack Coldhands as well, and Bran is grabbed as he tries to warn Jojen and Meera further down the slope. Summer tears off the arm and throat of the wight assaulting Bran and he begins to crawl the 50 yards to the cave.\n\nBran enters the mind of Hodor to help him fight off the wights. Meera reaches him as he waves her up the hill and grabs Jojen. Someone sets the wights on fire. Bran awakens in the cave before a [[Children of the forest|child of the forest]]. She takes them down into the cave, but Coldhands cannot follow them due to the ward on the cave against dead things. They go deeper, underneath roots and across a floor of bones, till they reach a skeletal body sitting on a throne made of roots - the [[three-eyed crow]], the last [[greenseer]].\n\n==Character list==\n\n{{columns|2|\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Bran Stark]]\n*[[Summer]]\n*[[Coldhands]]\n*[[Meera Reed]]\n*[[Hodor]]\n*[[Jojen Reed]]\n*[[Leaf]]\n*[[three-eyed crow]]\n\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Arya Stark]]\n*[[Old Nan]]\n*[[Gendel]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n}}\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{columns|2|\n*[[White Walkers]]\n*[[Night\'s Watch]]\n*[[Children of the Forest]]\n*[[First Men]]\n*[[Giants]]\n*[[True Tongue]]\n*[[Old Tongue]]\n*[[Common Tongue]]\n*[[Winterfell]]\n}}\n\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 13]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Bran Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place Beyond the Wall]]\n\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 13]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 14, Bran]]</text>\n      <sha1>js7mmxfj4fvo6ydmz24xx797pipo68o</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Feast for Crows-Chapter 44</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5984</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166975</id>\n      <parentid>165679</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-06-05T19:28:38Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5669">{{Infobox Chapter AFfC\n| pov\t\t= [[Jaime Lannister]]\n| title\t\t= Jaime VII\n| place         = [[Riverrun]]\n| page\t\t= 658\n| previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 43|Cersei X]]\n| current\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 44|Jaime VII]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 45|Samwell V]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 38|Jaime VI]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n[[Emmon Frey]], now Lord of [[Riverrun]] in fact as well as name, demands [[Edmure Tully]]\'s head. Ser [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] will not accede, though he is sorely tempted since Edmure betrayed his concessions by helping his uncle, Ser [[Brynden Tully|Brynden]], to escape the castle when he turned it over to the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]]. Despite a massive search for Lord [[Hoster Tully|Hoster]]\'s brother, Jaime knows the Blackfish will not be found, nor will he abandon the fight. Before being escorted west to [[Casterly Rock]] as a noble prisoner, Ser Edmure speaks his mind, &quot;You will never know how sick it makes me to see you in this room, Kingslayer. You will never know how much I despise you.&quot; \n\nLater, Lady [[Sybell Spicer|Sybell Westerling]] and her daughter, the widowed Queen [[Jeyne Westerling|Jeyne Stark]], are brought before Jaime. Jeyne is in mourning for her husband and defiant to her mother, but when Sybell moves to slap her, Jaime intervenes and kindly asks Jeyne to leave the solar. Jaime confirms to Lady Sybell that House Westerling has its pardon, her brother has been named Lord of Castamere and marriages will be arranged for her daughters, though Jeyne will have to wait two years before marrying again, to prevent rumours that any children she has are actually [[Robb Stark]]\'s. Lady Sybell asks Jaime to inquire after her son, Ser [[Raynald Westerling|Raynald]], who accompanied Robb  to [[the Twins]], and had no knowledge of the arrangement between his mother and [[Tywin Lannister]]. Jaime, suspecting that Raynald is likely dead as Walder Frey also didn\'t know of the arrangement, agrees to inquire, promising that House Lannister will pay his ransom if Raynald is held captive. She then mentions that Lord Tywin promised a high-born marriage for him, &quot;that Raynald should have joy of him&quot;. When Jaime states that [[Joy Hill|Joy]] is his uncle [[Gerion Lannister|Gerion]]\'s natural daughter, Sybell shouts, &quot;You want a Westerling to marry a bastard?&quot;. Jaime, desiring to strangle the woman with her own necklace, retorts &quot;No more than I want Joy to marry the son of some scheming turncloak bitch. Your daughter is worth ten of you, my lady. You\'ll leave with Edmure and Ser [[Forley Prester|Forley]] on the morrow. Until then, you would do well to stay out of my sight.&quot; He then contemplates how much Lord [[Gawen Westerling|Gawen]] knew of his wife\'s schemes. \n\nThe following morning, Jaime warns Ser Forley Prester to guard Ser Edmure well, for fear either the Blackfish or [[Beric Dondarrion]] might try to free him. The knight is aware of his orders to kill Edmure should he try to slip away. Jaime adds that he should do the same for Jeyne Stark, stating that she is twice as dangerous as Edmure, should she escape. Jaime then visits [[Edwyn Frey]], who is preparing his army to return to the Twins. Edwyn divulges that his father, Ser [[Ryman Frey|Ryman]], along with his entire retinue, were hanged by Lady [[Catelyn Tully|Stoneheart]] near [[Fairmarket]]. Although Edwyn blames Jaime, the Lord Commander is well aware that Edwyn couldn\'t care less that his father is dead. And although Edwyn is now heir to the Twins, Jaime knows that [[Walder Frey (son of Ryman)|Black Walder]] will probably soon move to kill his brother. Jaime\'s only real concern is that the [[Brotherhood Without Banners|outlaws]] must be getting bolder if they are willing to kill Lord Walder\'s heir only a day\'s ride from the Twins. Jaime takes his leave after inquiring about Ser Raynald\'s fate. Apparently, Queen Jeyne\'s brother was responsible for loosing [[Grey Wind]] on the Freys, and was shot full of quarrels before diving into the river. An offhand comment from Jaime about killing those responsible makes the Freys drop their smug attitude about the act.\n\nContent that he has taken [[Riverrun]] without having to take up arms against the [[House Tully|Tullys]] or [[House Stark|Starks]], Jaime later agrees to allow Ser [[Desmond Grell]] and Ser [[Robin Ryger]] to [[Night\'s Watch|take the black]], commanding [[Rafford|Raff the Sweetling]] to escort them to [[Maidenpool]]. During Lord Emmon\'s speech to the people of Riverrun, Jaime speaks with the singer he took from Ryman Frey earlier. He reveals himself as [[Tom of Sevenstreams]], and tells Jaime that he hopes to play for Lady [[Genna Lannister|Genna]] and Lord Emmon over the winter. That night, Jaime dreams of his mother, Lady [[Joanna Lannister|Joanna]], whom he barely remembers, but the dream disturbs him when his mother cries and asks who he really is. In the morning, Maester [[Vyman]] delivers [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]]\'s message written by [[Qyburn]]. The old maester asks if Jaime wishes to respond, but the Kingsguard hands the letter to [[Josmyn Peckledon|Peck]], saying, &quot;No. Put this in the fire.&quot;\n\n==References and Notes== \n*The synopsis was copied from AOL  member vbkorik27 previously at  [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n \n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Feast for Crows: Chapter 44]] \n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Jaime Lannister]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Riverrun]]\n\n[[es:Fest\xc3\xadn de Cuervos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 44]]\n[[fr:A Feast for Crows, Chapitre 45, Jaime]]\n[[zh:\xe7\xbe\xa4\xe9\xb8\xa6\xe7\x9a\x84\xe7\x9b\x9b\xe5\xae\xb4-\xe7\xab\xa0\xe8\x8a\x82 44]]</text>\n      <sha1>ldxfe3am9uk9fjwyr3191v8lwg9jpd4</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Game of Thrones-Chapter 52</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6036</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>183779</id>\n      <parentid>165995</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-05-08T21:11:40Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11051">{{Infobox Chapter AGoT\n| pov\t\t= [[Jon Snow]]\n| place         = [[Castle Black]]\n| title\t\t= Jon VII\n| page\t\t= 462\n| previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 51|Sansa IV]]\n| current\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 52|Jon VII]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 53|Bran VI]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 48|Jon VI]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 60|Jon VIII]]\n}} __NOTOC__\n\nThe bodies of two men that accompanied [[Benjen Stark]] are found. Ser [[Jaremy Rykker]] blames [[Free Folk|wildlings]], but [[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] points out odd characteristics about the bodies. Back at [[Castle Black]], [[Jon Snow|Jon]] learns that King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] is dead and that [[Eddard Stark|his father]] is charged with treason. At dinner that night, Ser [[Alliser Thorne]] mocks Jon and his father, and Jon attacks him. That night Jon finds the [[wight]] of one of the dead men in the [[Jeor Mormont|Lord Commander\xe2\x80\x99s]] room. Jon kills the monster, saving the Lord Commander.\n\n==Synopsis==  \nWith the hounds being useless, [[Ghost]] has led the party to the bodies of two rangers. The area makes both the hounds and the horses nervous and even [[Jon Snow|Jon]] feels uncomfortable. Ser [[Jaremy Rykker]] identifies the bodies as [[Othor]] and [[Jafer Flowers]], two of [[Benjen Stark]]\xe2\x80\x99s men. It was Jafer\xe2\x80\x99s right hand that Ghost brought to Jon in the [[weirwood]] grove. The corpse\xe2\x80\x99s remaining hand is as black as the cloak he wears. Both of the corpses have the same pale skin, black hands, and staring blue eyes.\n\nRemarking that they are only two of the six men that Benjen took with him, [[Lord Commander of the Night\'s Watch|Lord Commander]] [[Jeor Mormont|Mormont]] asks Ser Jaremy how two men could die so close to [[the Wall]] without the rangers knowing; Othor even wears a hunting horn. Ser Jaremy insists that no horn was blown or it would have been heard. He goes on to complain that he does not have sufficient men to patrol and mentions the Lord Commander\xe2\x80\x99s own order to stay close to the Wall following Benjen\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance. \n\nMormont asks how the men died. A quick examination shows that Jafer was killed by an axe blow to the neck and that Othor is riddled with wounds. The old forester [[Dywen]] suggests that Othor was known to carry an axe. Ser Jaremy points out that [[Free Folk|wildlings]] carry axes as well, suggesting it to be the work of [[Mance Rayder]], which Mormont finds questionable so close to the Wall. Ser Jaremy asks who else it could have been. Jon knows the answer, they all do, but [[the Others]] have been gone for 8,000 years if they ever existed at all.  \n\nMormont declares that if Benjen had been attacked so close to [[Castle Black]], he would have returned for more men before going after the attackers. Ser Jaremy suggests that, sometime in the six months that Benjen has been gone, his party might have been attacked by wildlings and that Othor and Jafer were only the last survivors. To support this claim, the knight points out that the two bodies cannot have been dead for more than a day.\n\n[[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] now speaks up. The fat boy is present to be the eyes of blind old Maester [[Aemon Targaryen (son of Maekar I)|Aemon]], but Jon had to force the cowardly boy to even look at the bodies. Now Sam insists that Ser Jaremy is wrong about the bodies. At the Lord Commander\xe2\x80\x99s urging, Sam points out that the blood in the corpses\xe2\x80\x99 veins is dry and crusty, as if they have been dead for a long time. However, the bodies do not stink and have not begun to decompose; they are also untouched by maggots or scavengers. Suspicious of the untouched nature of the corpses, Mormont orders [[Chett]] to bring one of the hounds closer, but no matter how hard he tries, the hound fights to stay away from the bodies. In addition, Sam points out that there are no pools of blood to indicate the men were killed there, indicating that the bodies have been moved. The old forester Dywen and Ser Jaremy also note that they do not recall either Othor or Jafer having blue eyes.\n\nSeveral of the other rangers urge that the bodies should be burned, but the Lord Commander wants Maester Aemon to examine them further. It proves impossible to tie the bodies to the horses, who panic at their proximity to the corpses, so they are carried back on crude slings. \n\nLord Commander Mormont orders Ser Jaremy to search the area for ten leagues around, using hunters and foresters if he does not have enough men. If Benjen or any more of his men are around he will have them found, and if there is anyone else around, he will have them found as well.\n\nAs they ride back, Jon follows the Lord Commander and finds that it is too warm, with the Wall weeping copiously. This weather is called by the old men \xe2\x80\x9cSprit Summer,\xe2\x80\x9d when the season is giving up its ghosts. This means that winter is coming, and a long summer means a long winter. Jon now thinks back to the stories that [[Old Nan]] told of the Others coming riding in the dark and everything, including cities, falling before them and how they feed their servants on the flesh of human children. \n\nWhen they finally see the Wall, Lord Commander Mormont calls for Sam and compliments him, telling him that he is fat but not stupid. \n\nWhen they arrive at the gate, the Lord Commander is told by [[Bowen Marsh]], the Lord Steward, that there has been a raven. Mormont orders the bodies put in a storage room. Meanwhile, Jon notices everyone is looking at him and knows something is wrong. Jon searches out his friends and [[Pypar|Pyp]] tells him that King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] is dead. Jon wonders if his father will now return to [[Winterfell]] and decides that when he visits he will ask for the truth about his mother. His friends ask about the bodies, but Jon only says they were queer.\n\nAs he walks to the Lord Commander\xe2\x80\x99s Tower Jon notices the stares again, and when he arrives he is told that Mormont wants to see him. When he enters, Mormont surprises him with an offer of wine and asks him to sit. Jon states that it is grievous news about his father and the king which Mormont confirms. The Lord Commander tells Jon that it is said that the king loved to hunt and that the things we love destroy us every time. He then states that if it had not been for the love a woman, his son [[Jorah Mormont|Jorah]] would not have thought to sell poachers into slavery. Jon does not understand, but the Lord Commander gives no answer, only a repeated order to sit and drink. \n\nJon is told that his father has been imprisoned as a traitor for plotting with Robert\xe2\x80\x99s brothers to deny the throne to [[Joffrey Baratheon|Prince Joffrey]]. Jon denies that his father could ever be a traitor, but then recalls that he fathered a bastard; where was the honor in that? The Lord Commander explains that he plans to use his contacts in [[King\'s Landing]] to ensure that Eddard is allowed to take the black; they could use men of Eddard\xe2\x80\x99s ability on the Wall. Jon thinks that it would be a terrible injustice to strip his father of [[Winterfell]] but knows it would be preferable to death. Then he remembers Joffrey mocking [[Robb Stark]] and Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]], and asks if the king will listen. Mormont replies that Joffrey may listen to [[Cersei Lannister|his mother]], though it is too bad [[Tyrion Lannister]] is not there. Mormont declares it a bad thing that Jon\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmother\xe2\x80\x9d took Tyrion captive, but Jon haughtily reminds him that [[Catelyn Stark]] is not his mother. Jon then asks about his sisters and Mormont promises to ask about them. Then Mormont states that he hopes Jon is not going to do anything stupid; his duty is now here and his old life ended when he took the black. He then dismisses Jon, telling him that he can help write the letter the next day.\n\n[[File:Thomas Denmark jon snow whight.jpg|450px|thumb|[[Jon Snow]], [[Ghost]] and [[Mormont\'s raven]] confront the [[wight]] that was once [[Othor]] - by [http://thomasdenmarkportfolio.blogspot.com/  Thomas Denmark]. \xc2\xa9 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ Fantasy Flight Games] ]]\n\nDespite Mormont\xe2\x80\x99s words, Jon remains convinced the Starks are his family and wonders how it cannot be his concern. He also wonders whether his father could truly be a traitor. At the evening meal Jon realizes that everyone knows about his father\xe2\x80\x99s arrest. When his friends rally to him and assure him that they do not believe the stories, Jon realizes that they are now his brothers as much as Robb and [[Bran Stark|Bran]] and [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]]. Then Jon hears Ser [[Alliser Thorne|Alliser]] mocking both Jon and his father. In the blink of an eye, Jon jumps over the table and attacks Ser Alliser with a knife, but his friends hold him back and he is marched to his sleeping cell. Later, Mormont visits him and reminds Jon that he told him not to do anything stupid. Now the high officers must meet to decide his fate. A guard is left at his door, and his friends are not permitted to visit him, though Ghost is allowed to stay.\n\nThat night, Jon wakes to Ghost scratching at the door, and it is very cold. When he opens his door, Jon finds his door guard dead and he hears noises coming from the Lord Commander\xe2\x80\x99s chamber. Taking the dead guard\xe2\x80\x99s sword, Jon ascends to the Lord Commander\'s chamber where he finds the door open and [[Mormont\'s raven]] squawking. He sees the shadow of a man in black with icy blue eyes going into the Lord Commander\xe2\x80\x99s sleeping chamber. \n\nGhost attacks the man, and Jon pulls down the curtains so that he can see. The man has his black hands around Ghost\xe2\x80\x99s throat. Jon cuts off an arm with his sword and Ghost is able to wrench free. The next stroke cuts halfway through the man\xe2\x80\x99s face, and now Jon recognizes Othor. The severed hand claws at his calf and Jon pulls it off. Ghost attacks the hand while Jon strikes the undead man in the neck, but Othor slams into him, knocking him down. In the fall, Jon loses his sword. Othor is on top of Jon and attempting to choke him, but is finally pulled off by Ghost. As he regains his feet, Jon spots the Lord Commander standing naked in the doorway with an oil lamp as the hand approaches him. Jon grabs the oil lamp from the Lord Commander and throws it on the drapes, setting them afire. Then Jon grabs the burning drapes and throws them onto Othor, praying that the [[wight]] will burn.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/09/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-25 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/053/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 52]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Jon Snow]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in the Haunted Forest]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Castle Black]]\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 52]]\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 53, Jon]]\n[[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\x94\xd0\xb6\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbd VII]]</text>\n      <sha1>qi6rkpaoii7ga2lnpewruduc2gmjift</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Clash of Kings-Chapter 56</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6226</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166459</id>\n      <parentid>138657</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-23T20:58:53Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3783">{{Infobox Chapter ACfK\n| pov\t\t= [[Theon Greyjoy]]\n| place         = [[Winterfell]]\n| title\t\t= Theon V\n| page\t\t= 585\n| previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 55|Catelyn VII]]\n| current\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 56|Theon V]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 57|Sansa V]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 50|Theon IV]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 66|Theon VI]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] is having another nightmare when [[Reek]] awakens him to inform him of [[Asha Greyjoy|his sister]]\xe2\x80\x99s arrival in [[Winterfell]]. He has been having nightmares of the evening he and Reek killed the boys at the old mill and mounted their tarred heads on the gates of Winterfell. Theon is concerned because several of his men have mysteriously turned up dead recently. Asha has arrived with only 20 men, and she berates him for a fool for the slaughter of two innocent children, both of whom were princes. Asha plans to leave him only ten men, despite Theon\xe2\x80\x99s protests that the remainder of [[the North]] is mobilizing against him, and that [[Dagmer]] was defeated at [[Torrhen\'s Square]], allowing Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]] to begin marching back to Winterfell. Asha tells him he should have burnt Winterfell to the ground and brought the two princes to [[Pyke]] as hostages. Asha again calls him a fool for his actions, but gives him one last chance to burn Winterfell and return to [[Deepwood Motte]] with her. Theon will not hear of it, not wishing to give up his prize. He tells his sister he killed the boys to pay for [[Rodrik Greyjoy|Rodrik]] and [[Maron Greyjoy|Maron]], hoping [[Balon Greyjoy|his father]] would approve. Asha departs in disgust. Reek asks Theon for a bag of coin and leave to gather men, revealing he was born in the North and promising to gather between 100-200 men or more to help in the defense of Winterfell. Theon, desperate for a larger garrison, agrees.\n\nThat night, Theon dreams of the night King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] feasted at Winterfell, nearly two years before. But all the diners are dead, Robert with his guts spilling out, Lord [[Eddard Stark|Eddard]] headless, and dozens of others Theon has known. But there are others he has never met, a sad girl with a crown of [[blue winter rose|winter roses]] who could only be [[Lyanna Stark]], Ned\xe2\x80\x99s brother [[Brandon Stark|Brandon]] and father [[Rickard Stark|Rickard]]. And then [[Robb Stark|Robb]] enters the hall with [[Grey Wind]] at his side, both bleeding from dozens of savage wounds. Theon awakes, and goes outside; thinking that the castle belongs to the [[House Stark|Starks]] and that he should have gone with his sister. He stares at the heads above the gatehouse, and reflects on what fools people are when they look with their hearts and not their eyes. The heads on the wall are from the miller\xe2\x80\x99s sons, for Theon and Reek had never found [[Bran Stark|Bran]] and [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]].&lt;ref&gt;Jojen Reed\'s precognitive dream from [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 35|Chapter 35]] is fulfilled here&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n* [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2012/01/re-read-theon-v-prince-of-fools-not-so.html Analyses and summary of the chapter] in the course of a 10th reread by Slynt.\n* [http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/07/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-27 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n* The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 56]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Theon Greyjoy]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Winterfell]]\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 56]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 57, Theon]]</text>\n      <sha1>246qddlybemcseybvpbrne4ltl3qzts</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Game of Thrones-Chapter 24</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>3890</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>165967</id>\n      <parentid>122915</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-17T14:13:35Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9940">{{Infobox Chapter AGoT\n| pov\t\t= [[Bran Stark]]\n| place         = [[Winterfell]]\n| title\t\t= Bran IV\n| page\t\t= \n| previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 23|Daenerys III]]\n| current\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 24|Bran IV]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 25|Eddard V]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 17|Bran III]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 37|Bran V]]\n}} __NOTOC__\n\n[[Bran Stark|Bran]] is roused from his depression when he is called to the Great Hall of [[Winterfell]] to receive [[Tyrion Lannister]]. Despite [[Robb Stark|Robb]]\xe2\x80\x99s rudeness, Tyrion provides plans for a saddle that will allow Bran to ride a horse once more.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Bran Stark|Bran]] watches from his window seat as [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]] plays with the [[direwolf|direwolves]] in the yard below. [[Shaggydog]]\xe2\x80\x99s fur has darkened to black and his eyes are fiery-green; [[Summer]] has turned to silver-and-smoke with yellow-gold eyes that see everything. Summer is smaller and warier than [[Grey Wind]], but Bran thinks he is the smartest. Bran realizes he is crying; he wants to be down there laughing and running. Bitterly, he declares that the [[three-eyed crow|crow]] in his [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 17|dream]] lied about being able to fly.\n\n[[File:Old nan.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Old Nan - \xc2\xa9 Amok]]\n\n[[Old Nan]] agrees that crows are all liars and offers to tell Bran a story about a crow, but Bran is not in the mood and snaps that he hates her stories. Old Nan explains that the stories are not hers; they \'\'are\'\', before her and after her. Bran remembers [[Eddard Stark|his father]] telling him that she was called \xe2\x80\x9cOld Nan\xe2\x80\x9d even when he was a child. Possibly the oldest person in the [[Seven Kingdoms]], Nan has outlived all her own family except the simple-minded stableboy named [[Hodor]]. Bran insists that he hates the stories no matter whose they are. Unperturbed, Old Nan offers to tell a story about a boy who hated stories. \n\nBran does not want any stories; he wants his parents, and to run, and climb, and ride like before. His father had promised he could ride a real horse south, but left without him. Bran broods on all the people who have left [[Winterfell]] and seem to have forgotten him. Only [[Robb Stark|Robb]] and Rickon remain and even Robb has changed: he never smiles now and is so busy as the lord of Winterfell that he has little time for Bran. \n\n[[File:LastHero.jpeg|thumb|200px|left|Old Nan tells Bran the story of the last hero - \xc2\xa9 Amok]]\n\nWhen Nan offers to tell him about [[Brandon the Builder]], Bran insists that his favorite stories were the scary ones. Nan replies, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my sweet summer child, what do you know of fear?\xe2\x80\x9d Bran listens intently as Nan begins the story of the first time [[the Others]] came in the darkness of winter. Thousands and thousands of years ago, a winter fell like no other, and there came [[The Long Night|a night that lasted a generation]]. In that darkness came the Others: cold dead things that hated fire, iron, the touch of the sun, and every creature with warm blood. They overran holdfasts and cities and all the swords of men could not stop their advance. Women and children were not spared, and the Others ate the flesh of children. This was before the [[Andal]]s and the [[Rhoynar]] had come, when the [[First Men]] lived in the lands they had taken from the [[children of the forest]]. The [[last hero]] of the First Men set out to find the children with his sword, a dog, his horse, and twelve companions. All of the hero\xe2\x80\x99s companions and even his dog died, and he was left in despair of ever finding the children as the Others closed in. \n\nOld Nan\xe2\x80\x99s story is interrupted by [[Maester]] [[Luwin]], who tells Bran that he is needed in the Great Hall to greet [[Tyrion Lannister]] and some men of the [[Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch]], who are down from [[the Wall]] with a message from his brother [[Jon Snow|Jon]]. Bran complains that he wants to hear the rest of Nan\xe2\x80\x99s story, but Nan tells him that stories can wait. Hodor, the seven-foot stableboy, carries Bran down to the hall with Maester Luwin struggling to keep up.\n\nRobb is sitting in his father\xe2\x80\x99s high seat, wearing his armor with his sword across his lap. Even Bran knows what it means to greet a guest with an unsheathed sword and can feel the hostility in the room. Robb makes a point of only offering his welcome to the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch men. The meaning is not lost on Tyrion, who notes that he is not welcome and calls Robb a boy. Robb seethes, insisting that he is a lord. Tyrion responds that if that is so he needs to show a lord\xe2\x80\x99s courtesy.\n\nWhen Bran is brought forward, Tyrion notes that news of his survival was true and declares that Starks are hard to kill. Robb declares that the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] had best remember that and lifts Bran into the high seat. Tyrion asks how Bran fell, but Bran insists that he \'\'never\'\' falls. Maester Luwin is quick to add that Bran does not remember. Tyrion calls this curious, then asks if Bran likes to ride. Immediately, the maester insists that Bran has lost the use of his legs, and so cannot ride. Tyrion responds that with the right saddle and horse even a cripple can ride. Angered, Bran insists that he is not a cripple, but Tyrion retorts that if that is true then he is not a dwarf. Tyrion hands the maester a paper containing plans he has drawn up for a saddle for Bran. The maester states that it will work and he should have thought of it himself. Tyrion responds that the idea came easier to him, since the design is similar to his own saddle. Robb is suspicious of Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s motive, to which Tyrion replies that Jon asked it of him, and he has a weak spot for cripples, bastards, and broken things. \n\nRickon comes in from outside with the three direwolves, who immediately start growling and surround Tyrion. [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] comments that the wolves do not like Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s smell. Tyrion says that it is time he took his leave, but the wolves assault him before he can move more than a step. They are called off in time by the boys. Tyrion finds the hostility of the wolves to be interesting, and states nothing is harmed save his dignity. Even Robb is shaken and says he does not know why the wolves attacked. Before Tyrion can leave, Maester Luwin confers with Robb, who then offers the hospitality of Winterfell to Tyrion. Tyrion declines the invitation as a false courtesy, declaring that he will stay in the inn he saw outside the wall. \n\nRobb then tells the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch men they have rooms prepared, and invites them for dinner. Bran is looking forward to feasting that night with the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch. In his room, Bran expresses his excitement at being able to ride again to Summer. Bran dreams of climbing, and sees the shapes of twisted and grotesque gargoyles, and then he hears them whispering. The gargoyles pull themselves free and climb towards Bran. Bran starts to scream, shouting that he did not hear. He wakes to find Hodor above him. Hodor cleans and dresses him and carries him down to the Great Hall.\n\nThat evening, Robb and Bran host the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch men for dinner. The black brothers bring the dire tidings of [[Benjen Stark]]. [[Yoren]] states that Benjen is probably dead, but Robb vehemently disagrees. One of the brothers assures them that Benjen knows the haunted forest better than anyone, and will find his way back. Bran thinks of Old Nan\xe2\x80\x99s stories and blurts out that uncle Benjen will be saved by the children of the forest. Maester Luwin tells him the children have been dead for thousands of years, but Yoren disagrees, wondering who\xe2\x80\x99s to say what lives beyond the Wall?\n\nThat night Robb carries Bran up to his bed himself. Robb sits by Bran for a long time, and tells him that they will find a horse for him. Bran asks if the others will be coming back. Robb says yes with much hope in his voice. Robb then tells Bran that he can meet his mother riding his new horse and later they can visit the Wall together.\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Bran Stark]]\n*[[Rickon Stark]]\n*[[Grey Wind]]\n*[[Summer (direwolf)|Summer]]\n*[[Shaggydog]]\n*[[Old Nan]]\n*[[Hodor]]\n*Maester [[Luwin]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Hallis Mollen]]\n*[[Jyck]]\n*[[Morrec]]\n*[[Theon Greyjoy]]\n*[[Yoren]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Rickard Stark]]\n*[[Brandon Stark]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n*[[Balon Greyjoy]]\n*[[Jon Snow]]\n*[[Jory Cassel]]\n*[[Alliser Thorne]]\n*[[Benjen Stark]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Rodrik Cassel]]\n*[[Vayon Poole]]\n*[[Hullen]]\n*[[Harwin]]\n*[[Tomard|Fat Tom]]\n*[[Bran the Builder]]\n*[[Aerys II Targaryen]]\n*[[Catelyn Stark]]\n*[[Jeor Mormont]]\n*[[Waymar Royce]]\n|}\n\n==Terms and places mentioned==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[Winterfell]]\n*The [[Seven Kingdoms]]\n*[[Pyke]]\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[King\'s Landing]]\n*The [[Wall]]\n*[[Rhoyne]]\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[Others]]\n*[[Andals]]\n*The [[First Men]]\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[Children of the Forest]] \n*[[Night\'s Watch]]\n|}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2009/05/bran-eddard.html Humorous review of the chapter]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/06/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-13 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/025/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 24]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Bran Stark|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 24]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Winterfell]]\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 24]]\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 25, Bran]]\n[[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\x91\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0\xd0\xbd IV]]</text>\n      <sha1>0s3ehc44qq4zek90lzrot4rmfxwfy72</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 7</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5772</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>173798</id>\n      <parentid>99336</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-09-26T07:27:17Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2976">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Jon Snow|Jon]]\n| place         = [[Frostfangs]]\n| title\t\t= Jon I\n| page\t\t= 74\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 6|Sansa I]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 7|Jon I]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 8|Daenerys I]]\n| arc previous\t= \n| arc next\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 15|Jon II]]\n}}\n    \n==Synopsis==    \n[[Jon Snow|Jon]] is brought before [[Mance Rayder]], since [[Rattleshirt]] doesn\xe2\x80\x99t trust him.

Rattleshirt reveals his misgivings about Jon to the king, but Mance wishes to speak with Jon alone. \n\nMance indicates that he has seen Jon twice before, once when he was still a [[Night\'s Watch|black brother]] and Jon just a boy, and again during King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]]\xe2\x80\x99s visit to [[Winterfell]]. Mance had disguised himself as a singer in order to see King Robert and get the measure of [[Benjen Stark]], who was a bane to the [[wildlings]]. Testing Jon, he asks why he deserted the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch, but Jon asks him to tell his story first. The king explains that he had been wounded in a hunt and treated by an old wildling woman. She mended his cloak with burgundy fabric which was rare for wildlings to have and hence very valuable to part with. When Mance returned to the Watch, they replaced his cloak with a new black one emphasizing the importance of the black uniform and not recognizing the symbolism of her gift. Mance came to resent the restriction to the new black cloak of the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch.\n\nJon, knowing now that Mance was at Winterfell, asks, &quot;And did you see where I was seated Mance? Did you see where they put the bastard?&quot; The king then accepts Jon as member of the [[free folk]].\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Jon Snow]]\n*[[Mance Rayder]]\n*[[Rattleshirt]]\n*[[Styr]]\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n*[[Benjen Stark]]\n}}\t\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[King-Beyond-the-Wall]]\n*[[Night\'s Watch|Black Brother]]\n*[[Winterfell]]\n*[[Wildlings]]\n*[[Free Folk]]\n}}\n\n\n==References and Notes==    \n* The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].    \n*[http://slynt.blogspot.nl/2012/08/re-read-jon-i-beware-balrog.html Analyses of the chapter] in the course of a 10th reread by Slynth.\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/10/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-4 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords part 4] Analyses and summary by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Storm of Swords: Chapter 07]]    \n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Jon Snow]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place on the Frostfangs]]\n[[es:Tormenta de Espadas-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 7]]\n[[fr:A Storm of Swords, Chapitre 08, Jon]]\n[[zh:&amp;#20912;&amp;#38632;&amp;#30340;&amp;#39118;&amp;#26292;-&amp;#31456;&amp;#33410; 7]]</text>\n      <sha1>tw0nmpp73xqa8for5qyc37rm8xp4964</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Clash of Kings-Chapter 33</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6207</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166436</id>\n      <parentid>158533</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-23T20:51:16Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7751">{{Infobox Chapter ACfK\n| pov\t\t= [[Catelyn Tully]]\n| place         = A village near [[Storm\'s End]] - Outside the walls of [[Storm\'s End]]\n| title\t\t= Catelyn IV\n| page\t\t= 362\n| previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 32|Sansa III]]\n| current\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 33|Catelyn IV]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 34|Jon IV]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 31|Catelyn III]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 39|Catelyn V]]\n}}\n\n[[Catelyn Tully|Catelyn]] prays to the seven in a sept in a small village. As she prays, the realization comes to her that both [[Eddard Stark]] and [[Jon Arryn]] died for their knowledge of [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei\xe2\x80\x99s]] incest, and that [[Bran Stark|Bran]] also knows. She arrives back at [[Renly Baratheon]]\'s pavillion, where [[Brienne of Tarth]] prepares him for battle. She asks Renly to call a Great Council with his brother and [[Robb Stark|Robb]] to let Bran tell what he saw. He refuses to support the concept. Then, a shadow kills Renly. When the guards arrive, it is assumed that Brienne killed him. Catelyn escapes with her, and they join Catelyn\xe2\x80\x99s party to leave.\n==Synopsis==\nIt is full dark before [[Catelyn Tully|Catelyn]], Ser [[Wendel Manderly]] and Ser [[Robar Royce]] arrive at the village. The sept\xe2\x80\x99s seven walls\xe2\x80\x94one for each god\xe2\x80\x94are cracked and crooked. She enters alone. Catelyn remembers Septon [[Osmynd]] telling her every god is one with seven aspects. In [[Winterfell]], Septon [[Chayle]] hung carved masks, but here they are but rough chalk drawings. Catelyn prays to the Mother to spare them if she can, and spare her own sons. She wonders if [[Eddard Stark]]\xe2\x80\x99s gods ever answered him, and looks around. The Father\xe2\x80\x99s face reminds her of her dying father [[Hoster Tully]], the Warrior of [[Renly Baratheon]], [[Stannis Baratheon]], [[Robert Baratheon]], [[Robb Stark|Robb]], [[Jaime Lannister]], [[Jon Snow]], and for a second she sees [[Arya Stark|Arya]]. The smoke burns her eyes, and, after rubbing them, she sees her mother [[Minisa Whent|Minisa Tully]], who died in childbirth, in the face of the Mother. When her head starts swimming, she realizes she has not eaten today; food lost its savor when [[Eddard Stark|Ned]] died.  Then she thinks she can see [[Lysa Tully|Lysa\xe2\x80\x99s]] face, but the eyes are too hard; it is the face of [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]]. She first wonders if Cersei prays to the seven also, and then thinks if Robert, who did not regard [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] with any warmth, knew that the boy was of Jaime\xe2\x80\x99s seed would have put both him and his mother to death and few would condemn him. The children born of incest are considered abominations by the followers of both the [[old gods]] and the Seven; only among [[House Targaryen|the Targaryens]] was such practices common. She realises Eddard and [[Jon Arryn]] must have both known, hence why Cersei had them both killed, and she suddenly realizes [[Bran Stark|Bran]] knows also. She prays to the different gods for her children. Ser Robar interrupts her prayers to tell her they must leave to be back before dawn.\n\nThey pass through the army, and to Catelyn it seems like grey men on grey horses beneath grey banners. At Renly\xe2\x80\x99s pavilion, Ser [[Parmen Crane]] and Ser [[Emmon Cuy]] of the [[Rainbow Guard]] stand guard outside while inside, [[Brienne of Tarth]] is armoring the king and Lords [[Randyll Tarly]] and [[Mathis Rowan]] are speaking of dispositions and tactics. Catelyn asks to speak to Renly, but he tells her to wait. Lord Mathis is telling Renly that they should advance before dawn since the soldiers are in position, and Lord Rowan is agreeing since if they wait, they will charge into the rising sun, but Renly will not have it said his victory was won by treachery. Renly is sure that Ser Loras will break the first of Stannis\' lines. Renly commands that when his brother falls, his body be treated with respect. When Lord Tarly asks what to do if Stannis yields, both Renly and Lord Rowan are amused, and Renly recounts how Ser [[Gawen Wylde]] tried to escape to surrender to [[Mace Tyrell]] during the siege of [[Storm\'s End]], and Stannis was going to hurl him out using a catapult. He was only dissuaded by Maester [[Cressen]] telling him they might have to eat their dead; mercifully, the [[Davos Seaworth|Onion Knight]] saved them from having to eat the flesh of corpses, though Renly notes this was little comfort for Ser Gawen, who died in his cell. Renly, assuming Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] will be with Stannis (since Ser Barristan is neither with him nor with Robb and wants to guard a king), states he wants him spared. Finally, Renly is ready to hear from Catelyn, the lords departing.\n\nCatelyn now tells Renly that the Lannisters tried to kill Bran, explaining that there was a hunt the day he fell, and while Robert, Ned and most of the other men were gone, both Jaime Lannister and the queen remained at Winterfell. She then beseeches Renly to set aside the crown, along with his brother, and Robb would do the same. Then they could call a [[Great Council]] where Bran will tell his tale so the realm will know the Lannisters are true usurpers. Renly tells her the time for talk is done. As Brienne is kneeling, belting on Renly\xe2\x80\x99s long sword and dagger, a breeze seems to fling open the tent flap. Then, Catelyn sees [[Shadow assassin|a shadow lifting a sword]] that takes Renly in the throat. Brienne catches Renly as he stumbles into her, his blood flowing over her armor. Ser Robar and Ser Emmon come rushing in, and, seeing Brienne covered in Renly\xe2\x80\x99s blood, immediately assume she killed him. Ser Emmon immediately attacks with a battleaxe as Catelyn screams \xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d. Brienne is soon in battle with Ser Emmon and the two men-at-arms with them. Catelyn starts to tell Ser Robar, who hangs back uncertainly, that is was Stannis, only being able to explain it as some sort of sorcery, a shadow, swearing on her husband\xe2\x80\x99s grave and her honor. Ser Robar promises to hold them off and leaves the tent. Brienne has taken out the men-at-arms but now the armored Ser Emmon is in her wool. Catelyn bashes an iron brazier over Ser Emmon\xe2\x80\x99s helm, sending him to his knees and Brienne, seeing the chance, slashes through the tent side. Catelyn tells her to follow her slowly so they do not raise suspicions. \n\nBrienne has seen nothing, and Catelyn tells her it was a shadow, and she could feel Stannis. Brienne swears she will kill Stannis with Renly\xe2\x80\x99s sword. They arrive at the camp, and Catelyn explains that Renly is dead, and there will be no battle. She tells Brienne to select one of the many spare horses; they have to be far away before they look for them, so she does not have time to get her own armor and horse. Catelyn tells them to ride, and cut down anyone that tries to stop them.\n\nCatelyn thinks how all of Renly\xe2\x80\x99s power will now belong to Stannis, won in a single evil stroke; the lords present will have no choice but to side with the last Baratheon. Then she thinks how Stannis has also declared Robb a traitor who must be punished, and a chill goes through her as she recalls Stannis\'s threat that Robb\'s time will come.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n*Summary and analyses of the chapter [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2011/12/re-read-catelyn-iv-of-fire-and-murder.html in the course of a 10th reread].\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/04/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-16 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 33]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Catelyn Tully]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Storm\'s End]]\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 33]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 34, Catelyn]]</text>\n      <sha1>nt0ojyl2rthpzggpu6z1k5y7vc2mx1i</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 4</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6809</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166531</id>\n      <parentid>139819</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-25T14:47:12Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3499">{{Infobox Chapter ADwD\n| pov\t\t= [[Bran Stark]]\n| place         = [[haunted forest]]\n| title\t\t= Bran I\n| page\t\t= 60\n| previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 3|Jon I]]\n| current\t= Bran I\n| next\t\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 5|Tyrion II]]\n| arc previous\t= \n| arc next\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 13|Bran II]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[\xe2\x80\x8eFile:Marc Fishman Coldhands.jpg| Coldhands astride his great elk - by Marc Fishman \xc2\xa9 |thumb|250px|left]]\n[[Bran Stark|Bran]] is making his way through the [[haunted forest]], in search of the [[three-eyed crow]], accompanied by the Reeds, [[Hodor]], and [[Coldhands]]. Bran skinchanges into [[Summer]] frequently, and even into Hodor, although Hodor seems to dislike the experience. Coldhands is riding on an elk and is accompanied by ravens. [[Jojen Reed|Jojen]] is becoming ill and weak.\n\nColdhands stops to deal with &quot;foes&quot; he refuses to name, backtracking while the others continue on. [[Meera Reed|Meera]] points out that they have never seen Coldhand\'s breath even in the icy weather - and he does not eat, or drink, or sleep. Bran points out that Coldhands saved Sam and Gilly from [[wight]]s, so they must trust him.\n\nBran enters Summer in order to find an abandoned wildling village for shelter. As they rest, Jojen refuses to eat despite his weakness, telling his sister that this is not the day he dies. All four of them are near starving, but they refrain from lighting a fire at Coldhand\'s instruction. \n\nSleepless, Bran enters Summer on the hunt, who has found the corpses of five men - and the wolf pack that found them first. Summer/Bran squares off for a fight against [[One Eye|the leader]] of the pack, seeing in his eyes that he is in fact [[Varamyr|a warg]] like him. Bran/Summer defeats the pack leader, making the pack his and giving him the choice parts of the dead men. The dead men are in black - men of the [[Night\'s Watch]].\n\nBran awakens to a fire - Coldhands has killed a pig for them, and as the dawn is near he allows them to light a fire to roast it. Bran asks Coldhands, who fears the flames, what happened to the foes. Coldhands replies that they will not trouble him - he does not deny that they are dead at his hand. Only Jojen pays attention when Bran asks [[mutiny at Craster\'s Keep|who they were]] - but he already knows they were men of the Night\'s Watch. Bran asks the ranger about his black hands, and he tells Bran that the blood runs into a man\'s extremities and congeals once he is dead. Meera demands to see his face, which he refuses. Bran notes that he could not pass beyond the Wall and its enchantments.\n\nMeera asks who the three-eyed crow is and he replies \'\'&quot;A friend. Dreamer, wizard, call him what you will.

Illyrio explains that Tyrion and a sellsword called [[Griff]] will meet [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] in [[Volantis]], while he remains to &quot;smooth the way&quot; for them in Pentos. Illyrio tells Tyrion that Daenerys has need of cunning men such as him, but Tyrion is suspicious: why does Illyrio have a stake in helping Daenerys claim the [[Iron Throne]]? Instead of answering, the merchant tells of how when he first met her, Daenerys was young and fearful and her brother [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]] was foolish and greedy, and Mopatis had to post guards on her door to prevent her brother from &quot;undoing years of planning&quot; by entering her chambers and raping her before she was given to Khal [[Drogo]]. He recounts how the meek little girl he knew was reborn in the Dothraki sea as a true Targaryen, before turning to Slaver\'s Bay, conquering [[Astapor]], cowing [[Yunkai]] and sacking [[Meereen]]. He now expects her to make her way to Volantis - where she will meet Tyrion and Griff with enough forces to carry her to [[Westeros]].\n\nTyrion presses Illyrio, wanting to know why a slaver city like Volantis and a man such as Illyrio would want to assist Daenerys, and he says that her brother promised him the position of [[Master of Coin]] and the castle of his choice. Tyrion also demands to know how he is friends with [[Varys]], and Illyrio tells him that the two of them were thieves together in Pentos - with Varys spying on and stealing from other thieves, then passing them on to Illyrio, who would return the goods to their rightful owners for a fee. Varys trained a network of spies - young boys and girls - to steal information, and eventually the two of them became influential enough that Illyrio was able to marry the daughter of the cousin of the Prince of Pentos, and Varys was sought by [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys the Mad]] in his paranoia for the post of [[Master of Whisperers]].\n\nOver several more days\' travel through [[Andalos]], Illyrio tells Tyrion that he has managed to persuade the [[Golden Company]] to break their contract with [[Myr]] and instead accompany Daenerys. When Tyrion questions how Illyrio convinced the Golden Company- a group that has spent most of its history warring with the Targaryens- to side with Daenerys, the magister reminds Tyrion that the [[Blackfyre Pretenders]] are no more and that Daenerys can give the company of exiles what the Blackfyres never could: she can finally take them home.&lt;ref&gt;Early references to the Golden Company breaking their contract, an unusual event, are made in [[A Feast for Crows]], Chapters [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 13|13 (The Soiled Knight)]] and [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 17|17 (Cersei)]]&lt;/ref&gt; After Tyrion recounts the story of [[Hugor of the Hill]], he tells Illyrio that he had originally intended to become [[High Septon]] before he met and married [[Tysha]]. Illyrio likewise has a story of a [[Lys]]ene bed slave, Serra, his second wife, who was killed by the [[grey plague]]. As they continue to travel, Tyrion\'s thoughts turn to [[Shae]], and to Tysha.\n\n==Character list==\n{{columns|7|\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Illyrio Mopatis]]\n\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Aegon I Targaryen]]\n*[[Vhagar]]\n*[[Meraxes]]\n*[[Balerion]]\n*[[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n*[[Griff]]\n*[[Aegon IV Targaryen]]\n*[[Maegor I Targaryen]]\n*[[Baelor I Targaryen]]\n*Khal [[Drogo]]\n*[[Viserys Targaryen]]\n*[[Aerys II Targaryen]]\n*[[Varys]]\n*[[Pytho Malanon]]\n*[[Gerion Lannister]]\n*[[Tygett Lannister]]\n*[[Tywin Lannister]]\n*[[Rhaella Targaryen]]\n*[[Rhaegar Targaryen]]\n*[[Jaime Lannister]]\n*[[Barristan Selmy]]\n*[[Aegor Rivers]]\n*[[Daemon I Blackfyre]]\n*[[Maelys I Blackfyre]]\n*[[Hugor of the Hill]]\n*[[Serra]]\n*[[Tysha]]\n*[[Young Griff]]\n*[[Shae]]\n}}\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{columns|7|\n*[[Pentos]]\n*[[Unsullied]]\n*[[Asshai]]\n*[[Volantis]]\n*[[Stepstones]]\n*[[Rhoyne]]\n*[[Valyria]]\n*[[Iron Throne]]\n*[[Dothraki]]\n*[[Dothraki Sea]]\n*[[House Targaryen]]\n*[[Slaver\'s Bay]]\n*[[Astapor]]\n*[[Yunkai]]\n*[[Meereen]]\n*[[Mantarys]]\n*[[Westeros]]\n*[[Free Cities]]\n*[[Casterly Rock]]\n*[[Master of Coin]]\n*[[Myr]]\n*[[King\'s Landing]]\n*[[Valyrian Freehold]]\n*[[Dragonstone]]\n*[[Seven Kingdoms]]\n*[[Doom of Valyria]]\n*[[Golden Company]]\n*[[Redgrass Field]]\n*[[Ragged Standard]]\n*[[Second Sons]]\n*[[Maiden\'s Men]]\n*[[House Blackfyre]]\n*[[Disputed Lands]]\n*[[Lys]]\n*[[Tyrosh]]\n*[[War of the Ninepenny Kings]]\n*[[Andalos]]\n*[[Andals]]\n*[[Ibben]]\n*[[Flatlands]]\n*[[Velvet Hills]]\n*[[Faith of the Seven]]\n*[[High Septon]]\n*[[Braavos]]\n*[[Jade Sea]]\n*[[Treasure]]\n*[[Seven-Pointed Star]]\n*[[Battle of the Blackwater]]\n*[[Qohor]]\n*[[Ghoyan Drohe]]\n*[[Little Rhoyne]]\n*[[Lannisport]]\n*[[Vaes Dothrak]]\n}}\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 05]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Tyrion Lannister]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in the Flatlands]]\n\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 5]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 06, Tyrion]]</text>\n      <sha1>fzd6kg83jbpv1dsxrzkd0kb0s1r47di</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Feast for Crows-Chapter 2</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5631</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>198889</id>\n      <parentid>198888</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2017-04-19T15:56:45Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Exodianecross</username>\n        <id>6153</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <minor/>\n      <comment>/* Synopsis */</comment>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6154">{{Infobox Chapter AFfC\n| pov\t\t= [[Areo Hotah]]\n| title\t\t= The Captain of the Guards\n| place         = [[Water Gardens]] - [[Sunspear]]\n| page\t\t= 30\n| previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 1|The Prophet]]\n| current\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 2|The Captain of Guards]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 3|Cersei I]]\n| arc previous\t= \n| arc next\t= \n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n\nPrince [[Doran Martell|Doran]] has been at the [[Water Gardens]] for nearly two years now, watching the children play in the pools while trying to deal with his gout. Captain [[Areo Hotah]] hears the approach of [[Obara Sand]], eldest of the [[Oberyn Martell|Red Viper]]\'s [[Sand Snakes|bastard daughters]], and bars her from disturbing Prince Doran\'s rest. Deadly as she may be, she is no match for the Captain, but the Prince calls her into his presence before they come to blows. Obara demands justice for her father, imploring Prince Doran to marshal the Dornish army and give half to her so she might march on [[Oldtown]] and burn it to the ground, and the other half to her half-sister Lady [[Nymeria Sand|Nym]] to march up the Kingsroad. Doran tells her that his brother was not murdered, but died in single combat, and that Lord [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] has promised them Ser [[Gregor Clegane|Gregor]]\'s head. Unappeased, Obara mocks her uncle for his meekness and stalks off after he tells her to await his word in [[Sunspear]]. Fearing an uprising in Sunspear incited by the Sand Snakes, Prince Doran tells Hotah that he must return to his seat at the Palace of the Sun. The Captain reminds him that Princess Myrcella is there, and that Ser [[Arys Oakheart]] sends letters to Queen [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]]. Hotah thinks that he and the [[Kingsguard]] will eventually cross swords, and when that occurs the Captain will kill him. \n\nThe next morning, the prince and his retinue begin the journey back to Sunspear, but along the way they come upon another of the Sand Snakes. The beautiful [[Nymeria Sand|Lady Nym]] is far more tactful than her older half-sister, but no less resolved to seek vengeance for her father. Scoffing at Obara\'s demand to go to war, Lady Nym tells her uncle that she needs only her sister [[Tyene Sand|Tyene]], and the two will assassinate Cersei, [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]], Lord Tywin and King [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]]. Stating that his brother was only to take the measure of [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]]\'s court and not seek revenge for [[Elia Martell|Elia]] despite the seventeen years that have passed, Nymeria responds in parting, &quot;My sisters and I shall not wait ten-and-seven years for our vengeance.&quot; \n\nArriving in [[Sunspear]], the prince\'s retinue is accosted by townspeople calling for vengeance for the Red Viper. In the [[Old Palace]], Princess [[Arianne Martell|Arianne]] greets her father and tells him that Tyene Sand awaits him in the throne room. The third of the Sand Snakes is embroidering when the captain encounters her while bearing Prince Doran to his high seat. Tyene offers her uncle the cloth she is knitting, which shows her father mounted on a sand steed, so that he will not forget the Red Viper. Prince Doran responds, &quot;I am not like to forget your father.&quot; Tyene counsels her uncle to wed his son [[Trystane Martell|Trystane]] to [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]] now, and then crown the princess as is the [[Dorne|Dornish]] way. This would incite the Queen Regent and [[Highgarden]] to march on Dorne, where the prince\'s armies could bleed them in the high passes and treacherous deserts. When she calls her uncle fearful, Doran advises her, &quot;There is a difference between fear and caution.&quot; Tyene raises her hand to touch her uncle, but Hotah brings the butt of his longaxe down on the marble floor, and cautions her, &quot;My lady, you presume. Step from the dais, if it please you.&quot; The Sand Snake replies that she meant no harm and loves her uncle, he loved his brother. After she takes her leave, Maester [[Caleotte]] rushes to the Prince\'s side to make sure he was not pricked by one of Tyene\'s needles.    \n\nShortly after, Prince Doran commands the captain to round up and confine all the Sand Snakes, including [[Ellaria Sand|Ellaria\'s]] young daughters. Obara, Nymeria and Tyene are locked up in cells at the top of the Spear Tower, but with no blood spilled, the younger Sand Snakes are restricted together with their mother to the Water Gardens. When Hotah tells him that the common folk will howl when they find out, the [[Prince of Dorne]] replies, &quot;All Dorne will howl. I only pray Lord [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] hears them...so he might know what a loyal friend he has in Sunspear.&quot;\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Areo Hotah]]\n*[[Doran Martell]]\n*[[Obara Sand]]\n*[[Nymeria Sand]]\n*[[Tyene Sand]]\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Arianne Martell]]\n*Maester [[Caleotte]]\n*Maester [[Myles]]\n*[[Ricasso]]\n*[[Manfrey Martell]]\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Oberyn Martell]]\n*[[Trystane Martell]]\n*[[Mellario]]\n*[[Sarella Sand]]\n*[[Mors Martell]]\n*[[Olyvar Martell]]\n*[[Elia Martell]]\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Myriah Martell]]\n*[[Daeron II Targaryen]]\n*[[Daemon Sand]]\n*[[Jaime Lannister]]\n*[[Cersei Lannister]]\n*[[Tywin Lannister]]\n*[[Tommen Baratheon]]\n*[[Myrcella Baratheon]]\n*[[Fowler Twins]]\n|}\n\n==Martell family tree==\n{{Martell_tree}}\n\n==References and Notes==\n*The synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/02/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-feast-for-crows-part-2 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Feast for Crows, Part 2].

With winter fast approaching, the high seat of the [[House Arryn|Arryns]] will soon become inhospitable, and the entire staff is retreating for the valley floor. Her &quot;father&quot; is away at the wedding of Lord [[Lyonel Corbray]], who supports the Lord Protector along with several other Vale lords, including, just recently, Lord [[Benedar Belmore]]. Maester [[Colemon]] is concerned that Robert is being given [[Sweetsleep]] too often, as it is poisonous over time. However, he sees no other way to get the boy down the mountain without a seizure. After riding the basket down to Sky, Alayne and the rest of the household begin their descent on mules led by [[Mya Stone]]. Accompanying them is Lady [[Myranda Royce]], Lord [[Nestor Royce|Nestor]]\'s daughter.\n              \nRanda is a natural gossip, and tells Alayne that Lady [[Anya Waynwood|Waynwood]] and Ser [[Symond Templeton]] both showed at Lord Corbray\'s wedding, and that [[Riverrun]] has yielded, but not [[Dragonstone]] or [[Storm\'s End]]. Alayne is careful with her words around the very clever Randa, although she stumbles when the woman mentions that Lord [[Eddard Stark|Eddard]]\'s bastard now commands the [[Night\'s Watch]]. She thinks to herself it would be sweet to see her [[Jon Snow|half-brother]] once more. Randa discloses that [[Harrold Hardyng|Harry the Heir]] was recently knighted at a tourney, but Myranda doesn\'t like him because Lady Waynwood denied Lord Nestor\'s attempt to marry Randa to Harry. She also lets on that he has a bastard daughter despite his young age. Their banter turns to Mya and how her beloved Ser [[Mychel Redfort]] recently married one of Lord [[Yohn Royce|Yohn]]\'s daughters. Alayne reveals that Ser [[Lothor Brune]] likes Mya, but doesn\'t believe that the bastard daughter of [[Robert Baratheon]] is aware.\n\nAfter a rough stretch crossing a gorge, where Alayne has to carry a shaking Robert across, the party reaches the Gates of the Moon. She discovers that her &quot;father&quot; has returned from the east, and she goes to see him immediately. Lord [[Petyr Baelish|Petyr]] is entertaining three hedge knights he recently hired for his household, one of whom is none other than Ser [[Shadrich]] of the Shady Glen. Dismissing them, Petyr imparts word of [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]]\'s spiraling downfall, saying, &quot;It is quite vexing. I had hoped to have four or five quiet years to plant some seeds and allow some fruits to ripen, but... it is a good thing that I thrive on chaos. What little peace and order the five kings left us will not long survive the three queens, I fear.&quot; But he will not explain what he meant by &quot;three&quot; queens.\n\nPetyr then announces that he has a present for her- a marriage contract to Harry the Heir. He tells her that she must first win his approval before they are even betrothed, hopefully giving them enough time for [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] to perish, allowing her to marry again. Lady Waynwood agreed to the proposal because despite Alayne\'s &quot;low&quot; birth, she is nonetheless the daughter of the Lord Protector; not to mention that House Waynwood is heavily in debt (much of it now owed to Littlefinger). When Alayne asks how the young knight could be Lady Anya\'s heir when she has three sons, as well as daughters and grandsons, he tells her that Harry is actually Lord Robert\'s heir. He explains that Lord [[Jon Arryn]]\'s sister married a [[House Waynwood|Waynwood]], and her only son perished at age three. But their youngest daughter married a knight of [[House Hardyng]], who are landed knights sworn to [[Ironoaks]], and begot a son, now Ser Harrold Hardyng. Besides Lord Robert, he is the only living male heir to the Arryns, since he is Lord Jon\'s great-nephew.\n\nWhen Alayne learns this truth, she utters, &quot;If Robert were to die...&quot; To which Lord Petyr replies, &quot;When Robert dies, Harry the Heir becomes Lord Harrold, Defender of the Vale and Lord of the Eyrie. Jon Arryn\'s bannermen will never love me, nor our silly, shaking Robert, but they will love their Young Falcon... and when they come together for his wedding, and you come out... clad in a maiden\'s cloak of white and grey with a direwolf emblazoned on the back... why, every knight in the [[Vale]] will pledge his sword to win you back your birthright. So those are your gifts from me, my sweet Sansa... Harry, the [[Eyrie]], and [[Winterfell]].&quot;\n\n==References and Notes== \n*The  synopsis was copied from AOL  member vbkorik27 previously at  [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/09/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-feast-for-crows-part-30 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Feast for Crows, Part 30].

Racing onto the boats, Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s men are overwhelmed, and he goes over the edge of a gunwale, clinging for his life. Ser Mandon Moore appears and tells Tyrion to take his hand, his left hand. As Tyrion reaches for his hand, he instinctively withdraws as Ser Mandon\xe2\x80\x99s sword slices into his face.

Davos and his men bring Edric in secrecy to a ship of [[Salladhor Saan|Salladhor]]\xe2\x80\x99s, and Davos tells the boy that he must go with Ser [[Andrew Estermont]] on an adventure. With the boy safely away from [[Dragonstone]], Davos goes to face Stannis. He tells the King that [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] is dead, and [[Melisandre]] states that [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] will be named king. When she asks Stannis for the boy, the King warns her that she will pay with her life if she is wrong. Melisandre is sure that Stannis is the [[Azor Ahai|one prophesied 5,000 years ago]], that the comet was his herald. But Davos reveals that Edric Storm is gone, and judges based on her reaction that Melisandre has not foreseen this in her flames. Davos tells Stannis that a king must protect his people or he is no king at all. When Stannis draws [[Lightbringer]] to behead Davos, the Onion Knight begins to read out the letter that Maester Pylos received from the [[Night\'s Watch]].\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Davos Seaworth]] The Onion Knight\n*[[Stannis Baratheon]]\n*[[Edric Storm]]\n*[[Pylos]]\n*[[Salladhor Saan]]\n*[[Andrew Estermont]]\n*[[Melisandre]]\n*[[Tommen Baratheon]]\n*[[Azor Ahai]]\n}}\t\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Riverrun]]\n*[[Hand of the King]]\n*[[Lightbringer]]\n*[[Night\'s Watch]]\n*[[Great Other]]\n*[[Red Comet]]\n}}\n\n\n==References and Notes==\n* The synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/08/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-38 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Part 38].

[[Dareon]] has abandoned them for the brothels, [[Gilly]] remains inconsolable, and Maester [[Aemon Targaryen|Aemon]]\'s health deteriorates daily. To make matters worse, Sam had spent nearly all their coin on their rooms, a healer for Aemon, and passage on a boat, [[Lady Ushanora]], that they wound up unable to board due to the maester\'s health. Feverish and dying, the maester begs Sam to return to the docks to learn more about this rumor of dragons that Dareon had heard at some winesink. Aemon mumbles to Sam, &quot;Dragons. The grief and glory of [[House Targaryen|my house]]... [[Template:Targaryen tree Daeron II|My brothers]] dreamed of dragons too, and the dreams killed them, every one. Sam, we tremble on the cusp of half-remembered prophecies... I should have seen it. Fire consumes, but cold preserves. [[The Wall]]...&quot;\n\nSam departs that night to find Dareon, but gets accosted by two bravos because he is wearing a sword. However, he is saved by [[Arya Stark|Cat of the Canals]], who tells him of another black brother about to wed the [[Sailor\'s Wife]]. Sam finds Dareon at the [[Happy Port]], but his brother from [[Night\'s Watch|the Watch]] wants nothing more to do with the black, or Gilly and Aemon for that matter. Sam punches him in the face, but gets tossed into the canal by the proprietors of the brothel. He is saved from drowning by [[Xhondo]], a huge [[Summer Islands|Summer Islander]], who is a mate aboard the [[Cinnamon Wind]] and knows of these dragons that Sam had mentioned.\n\n==References and Notes==\n*The synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/06/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-feast-for-crows-part-19 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Feast for Crows, Part 19].

Out in the courtyard they watch the new recruits practicing and Jon talks with [[Donal Noye]]. After they present their maps, [[Lord Commander of the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch|Lord Commander]] [[Jeor Mormont]] discusses [[Maester Aemon]]\xe2\x80\x99s past with Jon.  \n\n==Synopsis==   \n[[File:Amokajonsnow.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Jon Snow- by Amok\xc2\xa9]]\n\n[[Jon Snow|Jon]] calls out to [[Samwell Tarly]] amidst the ancient books and scrolls of [[Castle Black]]\xe2\x80\x99s library. Jon wends his way down the narrow aisles toward the glow of Sam\xe2\x80\x99s lamp to find the fat boy hunched over a table. When Jon asks if he has been there all night, Sam reveals that he lost all track of time in the windowless cellar. Jon calls Sam a sweet fool and reminds him that soon they will be sleeping on hard ground, not soft beds. Sam yawns and explains that [[Maester Aemon]] sent him to find maps for [[Lord Commander of the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch|Lord Commander]] [[Jeor Mormont|Mormont]], but he never thought there would be thousands of interesting documents to read. Jon is unimpressed by the books and asks if Sam found the maps.\n\nSam gestures toward a clutter of books and scrolls on the table and declares he has found at least a dozen. He shows Jon a faded parchment that marks the sites of many [[wildling]] villages. Then he excitedly shows Jon an account of a ranging to [[Lorn Point]] by a ranger named [[Redwyn]] from before the [[War of Conquest|Targaryen Conquest]] that mentions fighting with [[giant]]s and trading with the [[children of the forest]]. Meaning to sound encouraging, Jon suggests that Sam can write an account of their own [[the great ranging|great ranging]], but talk of what they are to face on the morrow makes Sam uncomfortable. He shuffles scrolls about and says there are more maps if he only had time to set the library in order, which will take years. Jon remarks that the Lord Commander wanted the maps a little sooner than that. \n\nWhen Jon picks up a scroll it crumbles in his hand. Sam explains that the most important documents were copied over when needed, and the oldest have likely been copied half a hundred times. Jon says there is no need to copy this one, which is only a list of goods. Sam seems fascinated, but Jon wonders who would care how much pickled cod men ate six hundred years ago. Sam insists that he would, since it can tell them how many men were in the [[Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch]], and how they lived, and what they ate. Jon responds that they ate food and lived as he and Sam do. Sam disagrees and claims that the vault is a treasure trove. Jon is dubious: to him treasure means gold, silver, and jewels. Sam has also found works even the [[Citadel]] does not have: drawings of [[weirwood]] faces, thousand year old counts of the seasons, scrolls from old [[Valyria]], and even a book about the language of the children of the forest.\n\nJon assures Sam the books will still be here when they return, but Sam replies, \xe2\x80\x9cIf we return.\xe2\x80\x9d Jon tries to reassure Sam by pointing out that Mormont is taking 200 seasoned men (most of them rangers), and [[Qhorin Halfhand]] will join them with 100 more from the [[Shadow Tower]]. He insists Sam will be as safe as back at [[Horn Hill]], but Sam replies that he was never very safe there either. \n\nJon thinks it a cruel joke that [[Pyp]] and [[Toad]] (who want to go) are to remain behind while Sam (the self-proclaimed coward) must go in Maester Aemon\xe2\x80\x99s place to tend the two cages of ravens. Sam argues that Jon or [[Grenn]] could care for the ravens, and Jon can write messages as well as he can. Jon insists that he has his own duties as the Lord Commander\xe2\x80\x99s steward. He reminds Sam that he said the vows, but Sam says that a brother of the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch should not be so scared. Jon insists they are all scared, and they should be with so many rangers disappearing in the last two years, but what matters is how they face it. Then he offers to help gather up the maps and they depart the library.\n\n[[File:The wall and Castle Black by Feliche.jpg|thumb|330px|left|The Wall and Castle Black - by Feliche\xc2\xa9]]\n\nThe vault opens onto one of the underground passages called the wormwalks, which bind Castle Black together in winter. Jon thinks of the [[white raven]] that came to Maester Aemon, and knows winter will come soon. He remembers the last winter, which was short and mild, but he can feel that this one will be different. By the time they reach the surface, Sam is out of breath. The sight of [[the Wall]] reminds Jon that it marks the end of the world, and tomorrow they are going beyond it. \n\nThe morning sky is streaked by clouds but the [[red comet]] is still visible behind them, even by day. The black brothers have dubbed it \xe2\x80\x9cMormont\xe2\x80\x99s Torch,\xe2\x80\x9d claiming (only half in jest) that the gods have sent it to light the way through the [[haunted forest]]. The castle seems deserted with so many gone to the brothel in [[Mole\'s Town]]. Grenn is among them, since Pyp and [[Halder]] and Toad offered to buy him his first woman. They invited Jon and Sam as well, but Jon insisted on keeping his vow of celibacy and Sam is as frightened of whores as he is of everything else.\n\nAs they pass the [[sept]], they hear a hymn being sung. Jon notes that on the eve of battle some men want whores and some want gods. He wonders who feels better after. The sept tempts him no more than the brothel; the [[Faith of the Seven|Seven]] have no power beyond the Wall, but the nameless [[old gods]] whom Jon worships will be waiting there.\n\nOutside the armory, Ser [[Endrew Tarth]] is training the six new recruits brought in the previous night. Ser Endrew is a gentler master-at-arms than Ser [[Alliser Thorne]], but his lessons can still raise bruises. Sam winces at the sight, but Jon watches closely. From the door of the armory, the one-armed smith [[Donal Noye]] asks Jon\xe2\x80\x99s opinion of the recruits. Jon declares they smell of summer and asks where [[Conwy]] recruited them. Noye says it was a dungeon near [[Gulltown]] and labels the recruits as a brigand, a barber, a [[Hop-Robin|beggar]], [[Arron|two]] [[Emrick|orphans]], and a [[Satin|boy whore]]. Jon replies that they will do; he and Sam did.\n\n[[File:Brittmartin Donal Noyle.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Donal Noye - by BrittMartin \xc2\xa9 Green Ronin Publishing]]\n\nNoye asks Jon if he has heard that his brother [[Robb Stark]] is now a [[King in the North|king]]. Jon admits that last night in the common room there was talk of little else. Jon is still unsure how he feels about the brother he grew up with becoming a king while he remains on the Wall, but he tells Noye that Robb will make a good king. Noye is not so sure and declares that once he might have said the same of [[Robert Baratheon]], but Robert was never the same after he put on the crown. Noye confirms that he forged Robert\xe2\x80\x99s warhammer and claims he knew the [[House Baratheon|Baratheon]] brothers as well as anyone. The smith compares Robert to a sword: made for fighting and prone to rust if left unused. When Jon asks if Robert\xe2\x80\x99s brothers are the same, Noye considers for a moment then declares:\n\n{{Quote|Robert was the true steel. [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] is pure iron, black and hard and strong, yes, but brittle, the way iron gets. He\xe2\x80\x99ll break before he bends. And [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]], that one, he\xe2\x80\x99s copper, bright and shiny, pretty to look at but not worth all that much at the end of the day.}}\n\nJon wonders what metal Robb is, but decides it is best not to ask. Noye was a Baratheon man before taking the black and likely believes Robb is a traitor. There is an unspoken pact amongst the Watch not to probe too deeply into such matters since old loyalties are not easily forgotten. Even Sam\xe2\x80\x99s former [[House Tarly|House]] is sworn to [[Highgarden]], which has supported Renly. As Jon departs with Sam, Noye offers a prayer for Jon on the morrow and urges him to bring his [[Benjen Stark|uncle]] back.\n\nJon leaves Ghost outside the door of the King\xe2\x80\x99s Tower, where Lord Commander Mormont resides now that fire has gutted his own tower. Sam is disheartened by the number of stairs, but Jon jests that stairs are one thing they will not confront beyond the Wall. \n\n[[File:Jeor Mormont by reneaigner.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Lord Commander Jeor Mormont- by Rene Aigner\xc2\xa9]]\n\nWhen they enter the solar, Mormont complains about how long it took them. Ignoring the boys, [[Thoren Smallwood]] argues that the Lord Commander\xe2\x80\x99s place is at Castle Black. Mormont declares that Smallwood can do as he likes if he ever becomes Lord Commander. Smallwood insists that the command should be his as First Ranger, but Mormont will have none of it. He declares that he already sent out two rangings and will not wait and wonder if the third is lost as well. Mormont dismisses Smallwood with the reminder that Benjen Stark remains First Ranger until his death is confirmed. Once Smallwood is gone, Mormont exclaims that he would sooner name Sam as First Ranger and complains that Smallwood called him too old for a ranging.\n\nBrusquely examining the maps, Mormont asks if they were all Sam could find. When Sam stutters, Jon points out that the villages might be gone, but the geography will still be correct. Mormont asks Sam about the ravens and commands that he wants the best, saying that if they are all butchered he means for his successor to know where and how. Talk of butchery leaves Sam open-mouthed and speechless. Mormont declares he is too busy for such behavior and dismisses Sam, who almost trips in his haste to leave. \n\nMormont asks, without waiting for an answer, whether Sam is as big a fool as he seems. He explains that he was considering sending Sam as an envoy to King Renly, since his [[Randyll Tarly|father]] stands high in Renly\xe2\x80\x99s councils, but Renly is not likely to heed a quaking fat boy so Ser [[Arnell]] (whose mother was a [[House Fossoway of New Barrel|green-apple Fossoway]]) will go instead. Jon asks what Mormont would have of King Renly, and Mormont replies that he will take anything that is offered.\n\nMormont continues that Ser Alliser Thorne should reach King [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] soon, but [[House Lannister]] has never been a friend to the Watch. Jon points out that Thorne does have the twitching [[wight]]\xe2\x80\x99s hand to show them. Mormont laments they do not have a second hand to send to Renly. Jon remarks that [[Dywen]] claims a man can find anything beyond the Wall. Mormont scoffs that Dywen also claims he saw a bear fifteen feet tall, insisting a man must believe his own eyes. \n\n[[File:Maester Aemon.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Maester Aemon - by Amok\xc2\xa9]]\n\nTurning the conversation back to hands, Mormont asks Jon about his burned hand. Jon explains it is well enough to wield [[Longclaw]] and that he is exercising the fingers as Maester Aemon suggested. Mormont opines that Aemon knows his work and prays they can keep him another twenty years. Then he asks if Jon knows that Aemon could have been king. Jon is taken by surprise; he assumed the maester was a younger son of a king.\n\nMormont explains that Aemon \'\'was\'\' a younger son, the third son of King [[Maekar I Targaryen]], who was himself the fourth son of King [[Daeron II Targaryen]]. Slow of sword but quick of wit, Aemon was sent to the Citadel when he was nine or ten and ninth or tenth in the succession. Jon struggles to imagine the 100-year-old maester as a little boy. Mormont continues that Crown Prince [[Baelor Targaryen (son of Daeron II)|Baelor]] died in a [[Ashford Tourney|tourney]] mishap and soon after his two sons, [[Valarr Targaryen|Valarr]] and [[Matarys Targaryen|Matarys]] died in the [[Great Spring Sickness]] along with King Daeron, so the crown passed to Daeron\xe2\x80\x99s second son, [[Aerys I Targaryen]]. Aerys reigned for twelve years (during which Aemon took his vows as a maester) then died without issue and the throne passed to Aemon\xe2\x80\x99s father Maekar I. During his father\xe2\x80\x99s reign, Aemon\xe2\x80\x99s eldest brother, [[Daeron Targaryen (son of Maekar I)|Daeron &quot;the Drunken&quot;]], died of a pox, leaving only [[Vaella Targaryen (daughter of Daeron)|a feeble-minded daughter]], and his second brother, [[Aerion Targaryen]], who killed himself by drinking [[wildfire]], believing it would turn him into a [[dragon]]. Less than a year later, King Maekar died in battle with an outlaw lord.\n\nA [[Great Council]] was convened to decide on the succession. It passed over Aerion\xe2\x80\x99s infant son and quietly offered the throne to Maester Aemon, but Aemon chose to abide by his vows even after the [[High Septon]] offered to absolve him. Therefore, his younger brother, [[Aegon V Targaryen]], was named king, and became known as &quot;the Unlikely&quot; because (as the fourth son of a fourth son) he was never expected to become king. Yet Maester Aemon knew that those dissatisfied with his brother\xe2\x80\x99s rule would seek to use him, so he became a member of the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch and remained at the Wall while his brother\xe2\x80\x99s descendents ruled as kings until [[Robert\'s Rebellion]] put an end to the line of the [[House Targaryen|Dragonkings]].\n\nMormont\xe2\x80\x99s raven begins repeating the word \xe2\x80\x9cking.\xe2\x80\x9d Jon notes that the bird seems to like the word, and jests that perhaps the raven believes Mormont should have a crown. Mormont declares that there are three kings already, which is two too many for his liking.\n\nJon asks why Mormont has told him all this about Maester Aemon. Mormont explains that Jon and Aemon have something in common: a king for a brother. Jon points out that they also share a vow. Mormont comments that if he had a man for every vow he has seen broken the Wall would never lack for defenders. Jon says he always knew Robb would be Lord of Winterfell, but Mormont insists that a king is a different thing:\n\n{{Quote|They will garb your brother Robb in silks, satins, and velvets of a hundred different colors, while you live and die in black ringmail. He will wed some beautiful princess and father sons on her. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have no wife, nor will you ever hold a child of your own blood in your arms. Robb will rule, you will serve.

He was released in secrecy from [[Riverrun]] by [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] after swearing never again to take up arms against the [[House Stark|Starks]] or [[House Tully|Tullys]], and to honor his brother [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion\'s]] pledge to release [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] and [[Arya Stark|Arya]]. The oath was sworn at sword point and while drunk, and Jaime considers killing Brienne and getting away. He is still chained hand and foot.\n\nJaime ponders [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei\'s]] feelings with him after the [[Bran Stark|Bran]] incident and wonders if she sent the assassin to Bran\'s room, but dismisses that notion thinking that she would have sent Jaime himself to do the dirty work. Their boat is moving down the [[Red Fork]] of the [[Trident]], and Jaime has Cleos shave his head so he will be less recognizable should they get caught. He and Brienne treat each other with contempt. She stops their boat to cut down and bury several tavern wenches hanging in the trees. Jaime mocks Brienne because a note reveals the women were killed by [[northmen]], most likely Bolton men, for servicing [[House Lannister|Lannister]] men.\n\nTheir trip is interrupted when Brienne spots a river galley bearing down on them. The galley is under the command of Ser [[Robin Ryger]], sent by Ser [[Edmure Tully]] to return the Kingslayer to Riverrun. Brienne jumps out of the skiff and climbs a cliff face. Jaime distracts the men on the galley by challenging Robin to single combat while Brienne dislodges a large boulder which crashes down on the galley, sinking it. When Brienne swims back to the skiff, Jaime considers smashing her in the face with his oar, but instead pulls her into the boat. Jaime derides Brienne and asks her if she wants his thanks, but she rebuffs the &quot;Kingslayer&quot; and says she is only motivated by the oath she swore to Catelyn to return him to King\'s Landing. Jaime marvels at Brienne\'s sense of duty.\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Jaime Lannister]]\n*[[Brienne of Tarth]]\n*[[Cleos Frey]]\n*[[Robin Ryger]]\n\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Cersei Lannister]]\n*[[Catelyn Stark]]\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Aerys II Targaryen]]\n*[[Genna Lannister]]\n*[[Emmon Frey]]\n*[[Tywin Lannister]]\n*[[Walder Frey]]\n*[[Sansa Stark]]\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Arya Stark]]\n*[[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n*[[High Septon (Fat One)|High Septon]]\n*[[Selwyn Tarth]]\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Bran Stark]]\n*[[Robert I Baratheon]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n*[[Jonos Bracken]]\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Marq Piper]]\n*[[Beric Dondarrion]]\n*[[Roose Bolton]]\n*[[Amory Lorch]]\n*[[Renly Baratheon]]\n*[[Sandor Clegane]]\n|}\n\n==Places==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n*[[Riverrun]]\n*[[The Twins]]\n*[[Casterly Rock]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n*[[Tarth]]\n*[[Evenfall Hall]]\n*[[Storm\'s End]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n*[[King\'s Landing]]\n*[[Trident]]\n*[[Harrenhal]]\n|}\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n* The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].    \n*[http://slynt.blogspot.nl/2012/05/re-read-jaime-i-throwing-wench-in-works.html Analyses and summary of the chapter] in the course of a 10th reread by Slynth.\n* [http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/09/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-1 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category:A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Storm of Swords: Chapter 01]]\n[[Category:A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Jaime Lannister]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place by the Trident]]\n\n[[es:Tormenta de Espadas-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 1]]\n[[fr:A Storm of Swords, Chapitre 02, Jaime]]\n[[zh:&amp;#20912;&amp;#38632;&amp;#30340;&amp;#39118;&amp;#26292;-&amp;#31456;&amp;#33410; 1]]</text>\n      <sha1>8cxb4wd79nto507oblu0h2yf7gc2mrn</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Feast for Crows-Chapter 3</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5737</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>184270</id>\n      <parentid>166935</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-05-22T22:47:48Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Mindset</username>\n        <id>4579</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <minor/>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14662">{{Infobox Chapter AFfC\n| pov\t\t= [[Cersei Lannister]]\n| title\t\t= Cersei I\n| place         = [[King\'s Landing]]\n| page\t\t= 46\n| previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 2|Chapter 2]]\n| current\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 3|Cersei I]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 4|Brienne I]]\n| arc previous\t= \n| arc next\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 7|Cersei II]]\n}}\n\n[[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] has a nightmare that features [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] mocking her. She is woken to be informed of Lord [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]\'s murder. She gives order to make sure that Tyrion is safely in his cell and reflects on who could be behind the murder, settling for [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] and the [[House Tyrell|Tyrells]] as suspects. In a rush of desire for her brother, Cersei asks [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] to take the position of [[Hand of the King|Hand]], but is rejected and settles for Ser [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]]. Information arrives that Tyrion has escaped.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] dreams that she rules from the [[Iron Throne]] and courtiers are paying her tribute. But the pleasant dream turns into a nightmare when [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] appears and ridicules her, making the great lords, proud ladies and young knights snigger at her as well. She notices she is naked and tries to cover up. Hasty moves make her wound herself on the spikes and blades of the Iron Throne and soon she is engulfed in a mortal combat with the throne that is trying to rip the flesh off her.\n\nShe is woken up by her frightened maid [[Senelle]], accompanied by armed men who have arrived to deliver the news of Lord [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin\'s]] murder. Cersei is still drowsy and believes this to be part of her nightmare. For a moment, she mistakes the [[Kingsguard]] knight who has been sent by the [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard|Lord Commander]] for [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] himself and expects Tyrion to crawl from under her bed to laugh at her, although she knows that he is safely in his [[black cell]] and his execution will take place the same day. She drank too much wine last night, she thinks. She now recognizes [[Jocelyn Swyft]], Ser [[Osmund Kettleblack]] and Ser [[Boros Blount]] and notices [[House Lannister|Lannister]] guards, while she is being handed lemon water to waken her up. She wonders whether the news can be true, insisting that her father is surrounded by guards day and night. Ser Osmund tells her the guards were on their post, but a secret passage has been found behind a hearth in the [[Tower of the Hand|Hand\'s Tower]] and Jaime has gone in to inspect it. Cersei is worried about Jaime\'s safety as well as of [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]]\'s, but she is told that guards supervised by Ser [[Loras Tyrell]] have been assigned to watch over the King. This stirs up her resentment against the [[House Tyrell|Tyrells]] and she wonders whether the murder was their doing, yet does not dare to speak this aloud. She commands Ser Osmund to escort her to the Tower of the Hand and Ser Boros to make certain that Tyrion is still in his cell. She doesn\'t believe Tyrion would dare to raise a hand against their father, but needs to be certain.\n\nOutside, the sun is beginning to rise while the stars can still be seen, making Cersei think that the great star of the west has fallen. Ser Osmund tells her that [[Lum]], one of the guards, found the body in the privy. She already feels the hole left by Lord Tywin and decides to act swiftly as she suspects there will be attempts to push her aside, as always. She wonders whether [[Stannis Baratheon]] is behind the murder. She enters the tower, thinking that not crying makes her the only true son her father ever had. Climbing the many stairs to the Hand\'s chambers prompts her to think about tearing the tower down. As she enters the hall, she finds the room full of guards and servants, whispering among themselves. Cersei resents their presence as well as the fact that she was not called first. She orders Ser [[Meryn Trant]] to show the people out and is informed that her father\'s body has been brought to his bed. When she enters the bedchamber, guards are present again as well as her distraught uncle [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]], kneeling by the bed and trying to pray for his brother. She notices how small the door to the secret passage behind the hearth is, making her think of Tyrion again, then settling for Stannis or the Tyrells as more likely suspects. She knows about the rumors of secret passages in the [[Red Keep]] and that [[Maegor I Targaryen|Maegor the Cruel]] supposedly killed the builders of the castle to keep them secret. She thinks of other, yet undiscovered, secret passages to other bedchambers and has a vision of Tyrion using one to get to Tommen.\n\nCersei has a look at her father\'s half-naked body. While reflecting on how he looks much older and smaller than when he was alive, she already notices a smell emanating from the corpse. She is furious that the quarrel that killed Lord Tywin has been left in his stomach and orders it to be removed. Cersei wonders whether she should act desperate and claw her own face, as she heard [[Catelyn Stark]] did when her son [[Robb Stark|Robb]] was killed before her eyes, and wonders how Lord Tywin once received news of his [[Tytos Lannister|own father\'s]] death. She commands that the bells must toll for her father just as they did for [[Robert Baratheon|King Robert]]. She asks for [[Pycelle]] and wants him to prepare the body, but is told that the [[Grand Maester]] has already been there and left again. This angers her more because of Pycelle\'s uselessness in old age and she calls for Maesters [[Ballabar]] and [[Frenken]] instead. Cersei asks about Jaime and is again told he\'s down in the secret passage, inspecting the depth of a shaft found there. She is worried about his safety, thinking of his lost hand and how the murderer might await him in the dark.\n\n[[Qyburn]] is shown in, offering his service as maester. He informs her that he treated Jaime\'s hand and she remembers that he came down from [[Harrenhal]] with her brother. She notices that he doesn\'t have a maester\'s chain, receiving the answer that it has been taken away by the [[Citadel]] while his knowledge is still there. She orders him to remove the quarrel and prepare her father\'s body for the silent sisters. Qyburn asks her what he should do with the girl. Cersei has not noticed the second body in the bed before and takes a look at her naked body, observing the golden chain around her neck and that her face is as black as [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey\'s]] was when he died. She is furious and demands to know what the girl is doing there, receiving the unsatisfying answer that she has been found where she is and that she was Tyrion\'s whore. She thinks that Lord Tywin never used whores and defensively tells a guard how he treated his own father\'s mistress after his death, parading her naked through the streets of [[Lannisport]]. Qyburn suggests that Lord Tywin might have been questioning the girl about her mistress [[Sansa Stark]]\'s disappearance. Cersei eagerly seizes on this notion but has a vision of Tyrion mocking it. She can\'t stand staying in the room with the girl any longer and goes back to the hall.\n\nShe finds Ser Osmund accompanied by his brothers [[Osney Kettleblack|Osney]] and [[Osfryd Kettleblack|Osfryd]] and orders them to make certain that nobody will ever hear about the dead girl in her father\'s bed. Her body is to be disposed of no matter how and everyone who talks about this matter will have their tongues torn out. She watches as the Kettleblacks put the girl\'s body in a blanket, remembering that the girl\'s name was [[Shae]] and that she came to her the night before Tyrion\'s trial by combat, asking that promises made to her by Tyrion and, allegedly, Cersei be kept, including a manse in the city and a knight to marry. Cersei made it clear that she would get nothing until she told them the whereabouts of Sansa Stark, making her leave in tears. She orders the Kettleblacks to carry Shae\'s body out through the secret passage, but wants to have the chain around her neck delivered to herself.\n\nAs Ser Osfryd is about to step into the tunnel, Jaime emerges from it. She rushes towards him, asking whether he has found the killers, but is told that the shaft ends in a chamber where half a dozen tunnels meet, some of them closed with locked iron gates, and Jaime needs to find keys first. He suggests that the killers could still be hiding in the maze he just left. Cersei again envisions Tyrion climbing through the walls like some monstrous rat, then reassures herself with the thought that he is in his cell. She says she wants the murderers to be found and that the whole tower will be demolished if need be. Jaime hugs her to console her and she has a rush of desire for him. She whispers in his ear, asking him to take over as [[Hand of the King]] to complete their father\'s work. But he pushes her away, declines the offer, makes a joke about a Hand without a hand and says that she shouldn\'t ask him to rule.\n\nCersei feels the rejection like a slap, realizing that it has been noticed by everyone present and that the whole castle will know soon. She angrily says that she didn\'t ask him to rule, as she is going to do that herself as the Queen Regent until Tommen comes of age. Jaime replies that he doesn\'t know whom to feel worse for, Tommen or the [[Seven Kingdoms]]. She slaps him. They are both admonished by Ser Kevan to take their indecent behavior out of the room where their father\'s body lies. Jaime apologizes for his sister, pointing out that she is forgetting herself while grief-stricken. This makes Cersei want to slap him again and regret her impulse to ask him. She wonders whether the position of Hand should be abolished altogether, remembering how [[Jon Arryn]] and [[Eddard Stark]] meddled in her affairs, the latter forcing her to get rid of King Robert before she could deal with his brothers, and how Tyrion sold [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]] to [[Dorne]], made Tommen a hostage and killed Joffrey.\n\nCersei settles on her uncle Kevan as the next Hand, as she considers him loyal and prudent while unambitious to challenge her as the real power behind the Iron Throne. She thinks that she needs men supporting her and that the current [[small council]] will not do, with Grand Maester Pycelle too old and Lord [[Mace Tyrell]] and his bannermen Lord [[Paxter Redwyne]] and Lord [[Mathis Rowan]] not to be trusted; she also can\'t rely on Jaime, who has lost his courage with his hand. She again considers the possibility of the Tyrells being involved in the murder, as Lord Mace must have known he can never rule the Seven Kingdoms as long as Tywin Lannister is alive. However, she realizes she has to proceed carefully against the Tyrells, with the city full of their men and [[Loras Tyrell]] now knight of the Kingsguard. The thought of the engagement of Tommen and [[Margaery Tyrell]] still makes her furious and she questions Margaery\'s virginity. Cersei intends to use [[Varys]] to find out more on this front.\n\nThe thought of Varys makes Cersei aware that the eunuch isn\'t present, while he is usually around when something important happens in the Red Keep. The only explanation for his absence is that he was involved in the plot, preempting his own downfall as Lord Tywin never had any love for him. She thinks that Varys might have known about the secret passage and acted on behalf of Stannis. She orders Ser Meryn to find the [[Master of Whisperers]] and bring him to her. \n\nSer Boros returns red-faced and puffing, announcing that Tyrion is gone, his cell open, with no sign of him anywhere. Cersei is appalled, thinking her nightmares are coming true. She points out her orders to keep the Imp under guard day and night. Ser Boros says that a goaler called [[Rugen]] has gone missing while two others were found asleep. She orders for them to be killed. Cersei\'s paranoia about Tyrion breaks out fully and reflects that he has already killed her mother, her father and her eldest son and will try to murder her too, remembering the prophecy she once received about her little brother killing her. She gets queasy and Ser Boros tries to sustain her, but she recoils from his touch, thinking that the knight of the Kingsguard might be one of Tyrion\'s creatures, too. He offers her a cup of water, but all she wants is Tyrion\'s blood. She envisions Tyrion grinning at her, feeling his hands closing in around her neck the very moment she thought she was rid of him.\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Cersei Lannister]]\n*[[Senelle]]\n*[[Jocelyn Swyft]]\n*[[Osmund Kettleblack]]\n*[[Boros Blount]]\n*[[Lester]]\n*[[Meryn Trant]]\n*[[Kevan Lannister]]\n*[[Tywin Lannister]] (dead)\n*[[Puckens]]\n*[[Shortear]]\n*[[Qyburn]]\n*[[Shae]] (dead)\n*[[Osney Kettleblack]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing\'\'\'\n*[[Osfryd Kettleblack]]\n*[[Jaime Lannister]]\n*[[Hoke]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Tommen Baratheon]] \n*[[Loras Tyrell]]\n*[[Lum]]\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n*[[Stannis Baratheon]]\n*[[Mace Tyrell]]\n*[[Maegor I Targaryen]]\n*[[Catelyn Stark]]\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Tytos Lannister]]\n*[[Aerys II Targaryen]]\n*[[Pycelle]]\n*[[Ballabar]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Frenken]]\n*[[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n*[[Sansa Stark]]\n*[[Jon Arryn]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n*[[Myrcella Baratheon]]\n*[[Paxter Redwyne]] \n*[[Mathis Rowan]]\n*[[Margaery Tyrell]]\n*[[Renly Baratheon]]\n*[[Varys]]\n*[[Rugen]]\n*[[Joanna Lannister]]\n*[[Maggy]]\n|}\n\n==Places mentioned==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n*[[Highgarden]]\n*[[Red Keep#Tower of the Hand|Tower of the Hand]]\n*[[Red Keep#Maegor\'s Holdfast|Maegor\'s Holdfast]]\n*[[Casterly Rock]]\n*[[Red Keep]]\n*[[King\'s Landing]]\n*[[Seven Kingdoms]]\n*[[Harrenhal]]\n*[[Citadel]]\n*[[Lannisport]]\n*[[Dorne]]\n|}\n\n==References and Notes== \n*The original version of the synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html] \n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/02/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-feast-for-crows-part-3 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Feast for Crows, Part 3].

His attempts to convince Lady [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] of his innocence are interrupted when the [[Vale mountain clans]] attack. During the fight, Tyrion saves Catelyn and afterwards he explains that [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]]\xe2\x80\x99s accusation has a hole: Tyrion would never bet against his [[House Lannister|family]].\n\n== Synopsis ==\nAs [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] watches the [[sellsword]] [[Chiggen]] butcher his horse he chalks up another debt owed to the [[House Stark|Starks]]. The mare was a gift from his brother [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] for his twenty-third name day. The sellsword [[Bronn]] tells Tyrion that none of them will go hungry, but Tyrion replies that he does not like eating horse, particularly his own horse. Bronn responds that the [[Dothraki]] like horse better than other meats. Tyrion reflects that maybe his horse is the lucky one, since he has many more cold hard days ahead of him. As he walks away from the sellswords, Tyrion thinks back bitterly to the night at the [[inn at the crossroads|inn]].\n\nWhen they took him captive his guard [[Jyck]] had gone for his sword, but Tyrion had stopped him, knowing it would only get them killed. Lady [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] showed the wounds on her hands all around, claiming they had been caused by Tyrion\'s dagger during an attack on her son. All the people in the inn, who had been friendly enough before, started screaming for his death. With only his men Jyck and [[Morrec]] to defend him, Tyrion had no choice but to surrender; his other companion [[Yoren]], being of the [[Night\'s Watch]], was sworn to take no part in such matters.\n\n[[File:Hidden Vale PassTysen Johnson.JPG|thumb|230px|left|The Mountains of the Moon -- Tysen Johnson. \xc2\xa9 FFG]]\n\nLady Catelyn stated, often and loudly, that they were taking Tyrion to [[Winterfell]] for justice. Tyrion had looked over the crowd and seen that things were not as bad as they seemed. Of the roughly fifty men in the common room, Catelyn Stark roused only a bare dozen. He announced that anyone who reported his capture to [[Tywin Lannister|his father]] would get a rich reward. Ser [[Rodrik Cassel|Rodrik]] then ordered the crowd to remain silent, and had Tyrion struggled not to laugh at the thought that Ser Rodrik was fool enough to believe they would. \n\nLady Catelyn then asked for help in bringing Tyrion to Winterfell, and was rewarded with several recruits. As they bundled him out of the inn he was not afraid, sure that they would never get him to Winterfell. Then they pulled a hood over his eyes and made a hard gallop through the rain away from the inn.\n\nIt was dawn and the rain had stopped when they finally pulled the hood off and Tyrion saw they were on the [[high road]] to the [[Eyrie]], not the [[kingsroad]] to Winterfell, and lost hope. Any pursuit would be looking in the wrong direction and these were the lands of the late [[Jon Arryn]], and his wife [[Lysa Arryn|Lysa]] was a [[House Tully|Tully]]. What was more galling than the abduction was that Lady Catelyn had outwitted him.\n\nHe was spared the hood after that, and after the second night they no longer bound his hands. Still later, they hardly bothered to guard him at all; there was nowhere for him to go. The terrain was harsh and wild and the road no more than a stony track, and the mountains contained [[shadowcat]]s and the dangerous [[Vale mountain clans]]. \n\nAs they travel, Tyrion makes sure to remember the names of all his captors so that he can properly pay them back: \xe2\x80\x9cA Lannister always pays his debt.\xe2\x80\x9d He has a particular enmity towards the singer [[Marillion]], whom he blames for the whole mess, and who is currently looking for words that rhyme with \xe2\x80\x9cimp\xe2\x80\x9d for a song about this adventure.\n\nCatelyn, Ser Rodrik, and several others are discussing their situation and the pursuit by the Lannisters when Tyrion breaks in with the comment that there is small chance that the pursuit will catch them. [[Kurleket]] snaps that Catelyn did not ask his views, but Catelyn allows him to speak. Tyrion explains any pursuit will be heading up the [[Neck]], not towards the Eyrie. He states that they will find no help until they reach the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]], and that at their current pace they will only lose more mounts, which burdens the others more. The pace could also very likely cause Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s death, which Catelyn obviously does not desire. Catelyn replies that Starks are not murderers, and Tyrion states he is also no murderer. He follows up by telling her that he is not stupid, and would not arm a common footpad with his own blade. \n\nFor a moment, Tyrion can see doubt in Catelyn\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, but she asks why [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] would lie. Tyrion replies that lying is in Littlefinger\xe2\x80\x99s nature and mentions how the man often boasts of taking Catelyn\xe2\x80\x99s maidenhood, which Catelyn angrily denies. She calls Tyrion an evil man, but Tyrion calls her a fool, continuing on to say that Littlefinger only loves Littlefinger and was only interested in sex with her. Kurleket puts a knife to Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s throat and asks if he can bleed him, but Catelyn again tells him to let Tyrion talk. Tyrion asks how Littlefinger claims he obtained the blade. Catelyn explains that he won the dagger from Littlefinger at the tourney where the [[Loras Tyrell|Knight of Flowers]] unhorsed his [[Jaime Lannister|brother]]. \n\nThe cry of a lookout interrupts them, alerting them to incoming riders, and Catelyn immediately arranges the defense. Tyrion screams to Catelyn to arm him and his serving men, because she will need every man. Both he and Catelyn know that the mountain clans\xe2\x80\x94who are perfectly happy to slaughter each other\xe2\x80\x94will slaughter Lannister and Stark alike. [[Lharys]] slides down the ridge with the news that there are around 25 men: Milk Snakes or Moon Brothers. Ser [[Willis Wode]] asks Marillion for help with his breastplate, but the singer freezes with fear. Instead, Morrec springs to his assistance.\n\nTyrion pleads again with Catelyn, insisting that she cannot afford to waste men guarding them. At her request, he gives his word that he will put down the weapons when the fight is finished, and she orders them armed. Morrec arms himself with a bow, being better with it than a sword, and Bronn offers Tyrion a double-bladed axe. When Tyrion comments on his inexperience with an axe, Bronn tells him to pretend he is splitting logs. \n\n[[File:Painted Dogs.jpg|thumb|400px|left|The clansmen attack -- Ignacio Lazcano \xc2\xa9 FFG]]\n\nTyrion joins Marillion in his hiding place. Marillion whines that he is a singer and wants no part of the fight, but Tyrion forces his way in. The clansmen boil into sight, armed with a wide variety of weapons and led by a towering man in a [[shadowcat|shadowskin]] cloak armed with a greatsword. The knights and sellswords meet the charge. As the others shout \xe2\x80\x9cWinterfell\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[[Harrenhal]]\xe2\x80\x9d, Tyrion has to repress an urge to stand up and shout &quot;[[Casterly Rock]]\xe2\x80\x9d. From his hiding spot, Tyrion sees Bronn charge through the clansmen, cutting through foes right and left, while Ser Rodrik hammers the leader. Marillion shrieks when a rider leaps over them. When the rider turns, Tyrion charges and cuts the horse\xe2\x80\x99s neck so that the rider and his horse fall together on top of Marillion. Tyrion then buries his axe in the man\xe2\x80\x99s neck and uses this opportunity to crush Marillion\xe2\x80\x99s fingers with a boot. \n\nFor the rest of the battle, Tyrion keeps on the fringes, leaping out to cut at the legs of horses and kill wounded men, taking a helm from one. Tyrion watches Jyck get himself killed, then comes across Kurleket\xe2\x80\x99s body and helps himself to the man\xe2\x80\x99s dagger. Then he hears a woman scream. Tyrion goes to aid Lady Catelyn even as he thinks that he should let them have her. Tyrion gets the first man in the knee and Catelyn kills a second as he reels from a blow by Tyrion. The third man makes a quick retreat, and the fighting is over.\n\nAs Bronn helps himself to Jyck\xe2\x80\x99s boots, he asks if this is Tyrion\'s first fight, which Tyrion confirms. Bronn then tells him that he needs a woman now; nothing like a woman after a man\xe2\x80\x99s been bloodied. Glancing over to Lady Catelyn, who is dressing Ser Rodrik\xe2\x80\x99s wound, Tyrion quips that he is willing if she is. \n\nLooking over the dead clansmen, Tyrion notes that they are thin, ragged men with unimpressive weapons. The leader in the shadowskin cloak is not near as big or terrifying as he seemed now that the cloak is gone, and his great sword turns out to be notched and poorly made. They have only three dead: the [[House Bracken|Bracken]] men-at-arms [[Mohor]] and Kurleket, and Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s man Jyck. Tyrion remembers Jyck\xe2\x80\x99s bareback charge and thinks of him as a fool to the end.\n\nSer Willis Wode urges that they must proceed in haste before more clansmen arrive, but Lady Catelyn wishes to pause to bury the dead. When Ser Willis points out that the soil is too stony for graves Catelyn suggest they gather stones for cairns. Bronn tells Catelyn that she can do as she likes, but that he and Chiggen have better things to do than pile rocks, such as breathing. When Ser Rodrik agrees with Bronn, an angry Lady Catelyn agrees and they ride on. Now there are plenty of horses. As Tyrion mounts Jyck\xe2\x80\x99s horse, Lharys demands the dirk Tyrion took from Kurleket\xe2\x80\x99s body, but Catelyn intercedes, telling them to give him back his axe as well.\n\nTyrion is pleased to learn that Marillion the singer has broken several ribs, four fingers, and lost his harp. Tyrion is less pleased to find Marillion has also acquired the magnificent shadowskin cloak. The singer, for once, has nothing to say, and Tyrion can see him cringe when they hear shadowcats fighting over the bodies they left behind. He trots up to the singer and taunts that \xe2\x80\x9ccraven\xe2\x80\x9d rhymes nicely with \xe2\x80\x9craven.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he moves up to ride next to Lady Catelyn. Picking up the conversation from before their interruption, Tyrion points out that there is a serious flaw in Littlefinger\xe2\x80\x99s story: he \'\'never\'\' bets against his family.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/07/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-16 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/032/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n== References and Notes ==\n\n[[Category:A_Song_of_Ice_And_Fire_chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 31]]\n[[Category:A_Song_of_Ice_And_Fire_chapters--POV_Tyrion_Lannister]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place on the High Road]]\n\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 31]]\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 32, Tyrion]]\n[[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\xa2\xd0\xb8\xd1\x80\xd0\xb8\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbd IV]]</text>\n      <sha1>fn7g2d4zzisn5r1zeq9w21qafz00szf</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Clash of Kings-Chapter 3</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5647</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>196396</id>\n      <parentid>177771</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-12-09T00:20:19Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Fyr</username>\n        <id>7293</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13687">{{Infobox Chapter ACfK\n| pov\t\t= [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n| place         = [[King\'s Landing]] - The [[Red Keep]]\n| title\t\t= Tyrion I\n| page\t\t= 39\n| previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 2|Sansa I]]\n| current\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 3|Tyrion I]] \n| next\t\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 4|Bran 1]]\n| arc previous\t= \n| arc next\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 8|Tyrion II]]\n}}\n\n[[Tyrion Lannister]] meets with the [[small council]] and assumes his position as acting [[Hand of the King]]. After dismissing the council, he and Cersei discuss all that has happened in King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing, and Cersei grudgingly accepts him as Hand. Later, Tyrion travels to the [[Broken Anvil]], where he has finds [[Varys]] has already discovered his mistress [[Shae]].\n\n==Synopsis== \n[[File:Tyrion middle.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Tyrion Lannister \xe2\x80\x93 by Amok \xc2\xa9]]\n\nOutside the [[small council]] chamber, Ser [[Mandon Moore]] insists that Queen [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] has left orders not to be disturbed. [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] quips that he will only be a small disturbance and produces his letter from Lord [[Tywin Lannister]]. Ser Mandon remains unimpressed and expressionless, a trait which makes [[Jaime Lannister]] consider him the most dangerous of the [[Kingsguard]] (besides himself), since his face never hints at his next action. Refusing to back down on his first day, Tyrion introduces [[Bronn]] and [[Timett]]. After Ser Mandon learns that Bronn [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 40|killed]] Ser [[Vardis Egen]], he allows Tyrion to enter. Tyrion relishes that he has passed his first test.\n\nWhen Cersei sees him, she exclaims \xe2\x80\x9cYou!\xe2\x80\x9d with equal parts disbelief and distaste. Taking care to act confident in front of her, Tyrion remarks that he can see where [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] learned his courtesies. When Cersei asks why he is there, Tyrion saunters over to deliver their lord father\xe2\x80\x99s letter. [[Varys]] inspects the seal and proclaims it genuine before Cersei snatches it. Cersei has taken the king\xe2\x80\x99s seat, so Tyrion takes the Hand\xe2\x80\x99s chair, which seems only appropriate. Cersei declares the letter absurd and explains that her father has authorized Tyrion to act as [[Hand of the King]] in his absence. \n \n[[Grand Maester]] [[Pycelle]] offers greetings, and Lord [[Janos Slynt]] declares that there is need of Tyrion with rioting in the streets and a [[Red Comet|grim omen]] in the sky. Cersei lashes out that Slynt is the one in charge of keeping order and that Tyrion would serve them better on the battlefield. Tyrion replies that he is done with fighting, preferring the finer things in life. [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] declares Tyrion a man after his own heart, which reminds Tyrion that he must have a talk with Littlefinger about a certain dagger used in an [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 14|attempt]] on [[Bran Stark]]\xe2\x80\x99s life. \n\nCersei is not happy to learn that Tyrion has brought only a few hundred men; she is worried that [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] or [[Renly Baratheon]] will attack the city. Then she declares that only the king can name a Hand, and Joffrey has named Lord Tywin. Tyrion points out that Lord Tywin named him and recommends that Cersei take it up with him at [[Harrenhal]].\n\n[[File:Jonny Klein Small Council ChamberII.png|thumb|350px|right|The Small Council Chamber \xc2\xa9 Fantasy Flight Games]]\n\nTyrion requests a private moment with Cersei, and the other councillors excuse themselves. As he leaves, Littlefinger asks about living arrangements. Tyrion says he plans to take up residence in the [[Red Keep#Tower of the Hand|Tower of the Hand]]. Littlefinger declares Tyrion a braver man than him, considering the fate of the last two Hands. Tyrion corrects this to four, explaining that [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys]]\'s [[Rossart|last Hand]] died in the [[Sack of King\'s Landing]], and [[Qarlton Chelsted|the one before him]] was burned to death. The two before&lt;ref&gt;[[Jon Connington]] and [[Owen Merryweather]]&lt;/ref&gt; them were luckier in that they merely died penniless in exile. Littlefinger japes that in that case he would sooner bed down in the dungeon than the Tower of the Hand, and Tyrion privately thinks that Littlefinger might get that wish.\n\nOnce they are alone, Cersei asks why their father would ignore her royal command and inflict Tyrion on her. Tyrion points out that Lord Tywin has a large army and can do that, nor is he the first to do so. Cersei threatens to call the letter a forgery and throw Tyrion in a dungeon. Tyrion agrees that no one\xe2\x80\x94not even their father\xe2\x80\x94would protest, but asks why Cersei would want to do such a thing when he has come to help. Cersei insists that it was their father\xe2\x80\x99s help she wanted, but Tyrion can tell that it is Jaime she really wants, so he promises that if she supports him he will find a way to free Jaime. Cersei asks how, given that [[Robb Stark|Robb]] and [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] [[House Stark|Stark]] are not likely to forget the beheading of Lord [[Eddard Stark|Eddard]]. Tyrion notes that Cersei still holds the Stark daughters, forcing Cersei to reveal that she only has [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]]; she sent Ser [[Meryn Trant]] to apprehend [[Arya Stark|Arya]], but her [[Syrio Forel|dancing master]] interfered and the girl escaped and is likely dead.\n\nTyrion asks Cersei if she trusts the small council, since their father does not; Joffrey\xe2\x80\x99s short reign has been full of follies and disasters, which suggests the king is getting some very bad counsel. Cersei concedes that Joffrey, always willful, now believes that as king he is free to do as he pleases, not as he is bid. She explains that Joffrey was instructed to allow Eddard Stark to [[Night\'s Watch|take the black]] but took it upon himself to order Eddard killed, and Janos Slynt and Ser [[Ilyn Payne]] were quick to take the command. Cersei also mentions that as a result, the [[High Septon (fat one)|High Septon]] is accusing them of lying to him and profaning the [[Great Sept of Baelor]]. \n\nTyrion then questions Cersei about Slynt, asking whose idea it was to make him Lord of Harrenhal and a member of the small council. Cersei replies that Littlefinger made the arrangements; they needed the [[City Watch of King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing|gold cloaks]] on their side to stop Eddard Stark before he handed the throne over to Stannis Baratheon. Cersei adds that it was close even so; all might have been lost if Sansa had not come to Cersei with her father\xe2\x80\x99s plans. Tyrion expresses surprise that Sansa would betray her own father\'s plans, but Cersei explains that the girl was in love with Joffrey and would have done anything for him right up until he cut her father\'s head off and called it &quot;mercy&quot;.\n\nTyrion also learns it was Varys who suggested Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] be removed as [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard]] when Joffrey wanted to blame someone for [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]]\xe2\x80\x99s death. It freed the Lord Commander\'s post and council seat for Jaime, and allowed Joffrey to throw a bone to [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]]. A generous severance was provided, but Selmy would have none of it and fled the city. Tyrion notes that he heard Selmy slew the two gold cloaks sent to apprehend him, which Cersei blames on Slynt\xe2\x80\x99s incompetence. Tyrion points out that Barristan the Bold is a living legend who lends credibility to any man he serves. Cersei admits she did not think of that. Tyrion points out that their father did, and that is why he sent Tyrion to bring Joffrey to heel.\n\n[[File:Roman V. Papsuev Double Bluff.jpg|thumb|380px|left|Tyrion and Cersei \xc2\xa9 Fantasy Flight Games]]\n\nCersei argues that Joffrey will be no more tractable for Tyrion, but Tyrion points out that Joffrey might be more inclined to listen if he feels threatened, something he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel with her. Cersei insists that she will never let Tyrion harm her son, but Tyrion assures her that he only means to threaten. Cersei admits it is worth a try, but remains adamant that Tyrion do nothing without her consent. Tyrion agrees, then asks for an honest answer to who killed [[Jon Arryn]]. Cersei tells him she does not know, and goes on to say that Eddard Stark asked her the same question and hinted that Jon Arryn suspected her of something she hesitates to mention. Tyrion earns a slap in the face when he reveals that he knew about her incest with Jaime all along. Tyrion insist that he is not as blind as their father and makes several rude comments that earn him more slaps until he finally warns her that he is getting angry.\n\nTyrion asks how King [[Robert I Baratheon|Robert]] was killed, and Cersei explains that [[Lancel Lannister]] gave him strongwine of three times the normal potency before he faced the boar, which Cersei claims tasted like triumph when it was served at Robert\xe2\x80\x99s funeral feast. Tyrion, who rather liked King Robert, comments that Cersei was born to be a widow as he rises to leave. Cersei objects that she has not excused him and presses for details about how he will free Jaime. Tyrion tells her he does not know yet, but reminds her to make sure no harm comes to Sansa.\n\nOutside, Timett has disappeared to explore the city, so Tyrion commands Bronn to find him and make arrangements for the [[Vale mountain clans|clansmen]] in the barracks beneath the Tower of the Hand. Tyrion commands [[Vylarr]], the captain of Cersei\xe2\x80\x99s household guard, to provide an escort for him to the [[Broken Anvil|Broken Anvil Inn]], hoping to remind the captain that his oath is to [[Casterly Rock]] and not to Cersei alone. As he leaves the [[Red Keep]], Tyrion orders the spiked heads of Eddard Stark and his household taken down and given to the [[silent sisters]]. When Vylarr hesitates because King Joffrey ordered them to remain, Tyrion warns him that if they are not removed one of the spikes will have his head.\n\nAs they ride through the city, Tyrion notices the effect [[War of the Five Kings|the war]] is having on the common people. The markets are full of ragged men selling their household goods, but bare of farmers selling food. There are guards at every shop, and Tyrion notes that in lean times even bakers find sellswords cheaper than bread. Vylarr confirms that very little food is coming into the city with the roads closed to south and west. Tyrion asks what Cersei has done, and is told she has tripled the City Watch and has thousands of craftsmen working on the defenses, including the [[Alchemists\' Guild]] which has pledged ten thousand jars of [[wildfire]]. The thought of so much wildfire makes Tyrion uncomfortable, and he asks where the money is coming from, given that Robert beggared the realm. Vylarr explains that Littlefinger has introduced a tax on entering the city. Tyrion considers this clever and cruel, since tens of thousands are fleeing the war for the supposed safety of the capital. When they arrive at the inn, he dismisses Vylarr and says he plans to stay the night.\n\n[[File:Tyrion and shae by algesiras.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Tyrion and his mistress Shae \xe2\x80\x93 by Algesiras\xc2\xa9]]\n\nInside, Tyrion finds [[Shae]] sitting with several [[Black Ears]] and Varys. Tyrion is irritated that Varys found Shae so quickly and wonders who might have betrayed him. Varys says that he had a sudden urge to meet Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s young lady and Tyrion realizes that the eunuch is indirectly threatening him. The two exchange some veiled threats before Varys asks if Tyrion has seen the red comet. Tyrion replies that he is short, not blind; on the [[kingsroad]] it seemed to cover half the sky and outshone the moon. Varys tells Tyrion that on the streets it is called the Red Messenger, &quot;a herald before a king, to warn of fire and blood to follow.\xe2\x80\x9d Before Varys leaves, he poses a riddle to Tyrion:\n\n{{Quote|In a room sit three great men, a king, a priest, and a rich man with his gold. Between them stands a sellsword, a little man of common birth and no great mind. Each of the great ones bids him slay the other two. \xe2\x80\x98Do it\xe2\x80\x99 says the king, \xe2\x80\x98for I am your lawful ruler.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Do it\xe2\x80\x99 says the priest, \xe2\x80\x98for I command you in the names of the gods.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Do it\xe2\x80\x99 says the rich man, \xe2\x80\x98and all this gold shall be yours.\xe2\x80\x99 So tell me-who lives and who dies?\xe2\x80\x9d}}\n\nOnce Varys is gone, Shae asks if it is the rich man who lives. Tyrion is not so sure, saying it depends on the sellsword. As they climb the stairs to their room, Shae has to wait for Tyrion. Tyrion notes that he still has to look up to her even though she is only five feet tall, but he does not mind since she is so sweet. Shae quickly strips and then teases Tyrion that without her he will never be able to sleep in the Tower of the Hand without masturbating, and asks if that is why they call it the Tower of the Hand. She drags him to the bed, and they make fierce love. Afterwards, Tyrion calls himself a fool; Shae is a whore and only after his coin. When Shae asks what Tyrion will do as Hand of the King, he tells her, \xe2\x80\x9cSomething Cersei will never expect. I\xe2\x80\x99ll do... justice.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n* [http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2010/02/sansa-tyrion.html Humorous review of the chapter]\n* [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2011/03/re-read-tyrion-i-genesis-of-bitch-slap.html Review of the chapter in the course of a 10th reread]\n* [http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/01/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-2 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 03]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Tyrion Lannister]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in King\'s Landing]]\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 3]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 04, Tyrion]]</text>\n      <sha1>mis6h597uxu2lv7bw81d6l5xvt58peb</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Clash of Kings-Chapter 4</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5648</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166410</id>\n      <parentid>165434</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-23T20:44:42Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13748">{{Infobox Chapter ACfK\n| pov\t\t= [[Bran Stark]]\n| place         = [[Winterfell]]\n| title\t\t= Bran I\n| page\t\t= 52\n| previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 3|Tyrion I]]\n| current\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 4|Bran I]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 5|Arya II]]\n| arc previous\t= \n| arc next\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 16|Bran II]]\n}}\n\nPrince [[Bran Stark]] contemplates the [[red comet]] and listens to the [[direwolf|direwolves]] howling in [[Winterfell]], wondering about the reasons behind it all. He resents his broken body and the arrival of [[Walder Frey (son of Jammos)|Big Walder]] and [[Walder Frey (son of Merrett)|Little Walder Frey]], whom he blames for [[Summer (direwolf)|Summer]] and [[Shaggydog]] being locked up. When he tells [[Maester]] [[Luwin]] about his wolf dreams, Luwin gives him a sleeping draught to stop the dreams, but that night he dreams he is Summer trapped in the [[godswood]].\n\n==Synopsis==   \n[[File:John Matson Bran.jpg|thumb|230px|left|Bran Stark \xc2\xa9 Fantasy Flight Games]]\n\n[[Bran Stark|Bran]] prefers the stone window seat to his featherbed. Abed, the walls seem to press close about him. Although he cannot walk, climb, hunt, or fight as he once did, Bran likes to watch the lights begin to glow all over [[Winterfell]] in the evening and to hear the [[direwolf|direwolves]] sing to the stars. \n\nOf late, Bran often dreams of wolves. When they howl, Bran feels the direwolves are talking to him, brother to brother. He can almost understand them, as if they are singing in a language he once knew but has forgotten. His [[Catelyn Stark|mother]]\xe2\x80\x99s new wards Big Walder and Little Walder Frey might be afraid of them, but [[Old Nan]] told him the [[House Stark|Starks]] have wolf blood, though it is stronger in some than in others. [[Summer]]\xe2\x80\x99s howls are full of grief and longing while [[Shaggydog]]\xe2\x80\x99s are savage. Their voices echo around the castle and it sounds as if a whole pack haunts Winterfell, instead of only two where once there were six. Bran wonders if the wolves miss their siblings, too.\n\nWhen Bran asked why the wolves howl, everyone gave him a different answer. Ser [[Rodrik Cassel|Rodrik]] the [[castellan]] had no time for such idle questions, [[Farlen]] the kennelmaster believed it was for freedom, [[Gage]] the cook said they wanted to hunt, and [[Maester]] [[Luwin]] thought they were howling at the [[red comet]] because they thought it was the moon. When Bran repeated Luwin\xe2\x80\x99s words to [[Osha]] the wildling, she declared that his wolves have more wit than his maester and know truths Luwin has forgotten. When Bran asked her what the comet meant, Osha replied, \xe2\x80\x9cBlood and fire, boy, and nothing sweet.\xe2\x80\x9d [[Septon]] [[Chayle]] thought the comet was the sword that slays the season, which makes sense to Bran since soon after the [[white raven]] came from the [[Citadel]] to announce autumn. Old Nan could not see the comet, but claimed she could smell it and said it foretold [[dragon]]s. [[Hodor]] only said, \xe2\x80\x9cHodor.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nStill, the direwolves howl. The guards curse, the hounds bark, the horses kick, the Walders shiver by their fire, and even Maester Luwin complains of sleepless nights. Only Bran does not seem to mind. Ser Rodrik has confined the wolves to the [[godswood]] after Shaggydog bit Little Walder, but the stones of Winterfell play tricks with sound; sometimes wolves sound like they are right below Bran\xe2\x80\x99s window and other times they sound like they are up on the curtain walls. Bran wishes he could see them.\n\n[[File:Franz Miklis dragontail.jpg|thumb|220px|left|The Red Comet \xc2\xa9 Fantasy Flight Games]]\n\nBran can see the comet hanging above the Guards Hall, the Bell Tower, and the First Keep. Once Bran knew every stone of those buildings inside and out; he had climbed them all, scampering up walls as easily as other boys run down stairs. Their rooftops were his secret places, and the crows atop the broken tower were his special friends. Then he [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 8|fell]] and almost died. Bran does not remember falling, yet he supposes it must be true. When his eyes fall on the weathered gargoyles atop the First Keep where it happened, Bran gets a tight feeling in his belly. Now he cannot climb, walk, run, or swordfight, and his dreams of [[knight]]hood have soured.\n\nSummer howled when he fell, and for long after he lay broken, and Shaggydog and [[Grey Wind]] joined in his grief; [[Robb Stark|Robb]] told him so before he went away to war. The night the bloody raven brought word of his [[Eddard Stark|father]]\xe2\x80\x99s death, the wolves knew that, too. Bran wonders who the wolves are mourning now. Has some enemy slain the [[King in the North]] who used to be his brother Robb? Or has his bastard brother [[Jon Snow]] fallen from the Wall? Has his mother or one of [[Sansa Stark|his]] [[Arya Stark|sisters]] died? Or is this something else, as Luwin and Chayle and Old Nan think?\n\nBran thinks wistfully that if he were a direwolf he would understand. In his wolf dreams he can race up mountains taller than any tower and stand beneath the moon with the entire world below him, as it used to be. Bran cups his hands and begins howling like a wolf, hesitantly at first, but Summer gives answer and so he tries again. The noise brings the guard called [[Hayhead]] to his door, but Bran only howls at him until he leaves. \n\n[[File:Maester Luwin.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Maester Luwin - by Amok \xc2\xa9]]\n\nHayhead returns with Maester Luwin, who suggests Bran should be asleep. Bran insists that he is talking to the wolves. When Luwin offers Bran assistance getting to bed, Bran insists he can do it himself with the iron bars [[Mikken]] installed, but he does not want to sleep. Luwin insists that even princes must sleep, but Bran explains that when he sleeps he turns into a [[warg|wolf]]. He asks if wolves dream. Luwin thinks so, but not as men dream. Thinking of his father, Bran asks if dead men dream. Maester Luwin says some think so, but the dead are silent on the matter. Then Bran asks if trees dream. Confused, Luwin says no, but Bran insists that they do and says he dreams of a [[weirwood]] tree calling to him sometimes. Bran says the wolf dreams are better; he can smell, and sometimes taste the blood.\n\nThis makes Maester Luwin uncomfortable, and he wishes Bran would spend more time with the other children. Bran insists that he hates the other children, meaning the Walders. He reminds Luwin that he commanded them sent away. Luwin grows stern as he explains that it is not for Bran to send his mother\xe2\x80\x99s wards away, and asks where they would go if they were turned out. Bran says they can go [[The Twins|home]], since it is their fault he cannot be with Summer. Luwin argues that Little Walder did not ask to be attacked, nor did Luwin himself. Bran reminds the maester that Shaggydog was the attacker; Summer never bit anyone.\n\nLuwin reminds Bran that Summer tore out a man\xe2\x80\x99s throat in that very room, and claims the sweet pups have grown into dangerous beasts. Bran suggests they should put the Walders in the godswood; the boys can play [[lord of the crossing]] all they want, and Summer can sleep with Bran again. Bran complains that no one listens to him, even though he is the prince. He is not even allowed to ride [[Dancer (horse)|Dancer]] past the gate. Luwin insists that the [[wolfswood]] is full of dangers, recalling Bran\xe2\x80\x99s [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 37|last outing]]. Bran insists stubbornly that Summer would protect him and that princes should be free to sail and hunt and joust. Luwin asks why Bran torments himself with these dreams and reminds him that he is a boy of eight. Bran loses his temper and replies:\n\n{{Quote|\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d sooner be a wolf. Then I could live in the wood and sleep when I wanted, and I could find Arya and Sansa. I\xe2\x80\x99d smell where they were and go save them, and when Robb went to battle I\xe2\x80\x99d fight beside him like Grey Wind. I\xe2\x80\x99d tear out the [[Jaime Lannister|Kingslayer]]\xe2\x80\x99s throat with my teeth, rip, and then the war would be over and everyone would come back to Winterfell. If I was a wolf...Ooo-ooo-oooooooooooo.}}\n\nMaester Luwin attempts to reply, but Bran only howls louder until the maester concedes and departs. Howling loses its savor once Bran is alone and he quiets. Resentfully, Bran recalls that he did welcome the Walders when they arrived from [[the Twins]]. Rickon was the one who threw the tantrum then, screaming that he wanted Mother and Father and Robb, not these strangers. It was Bran who soothed him and welcomed the Freys. Even Maester Luwin said he did well. Then they played the [[lord of the crossing]] game in a pool in the godswood.\n\nThe game was played with a log, a stick, a body of water, and a great deal of shouting. The lord of the crossing stood in the middle of the water and was the only one who got to use a stick. The other players had to make up speeches about who they were and why they should be allowed to cross. The lord could make them swear oaths and answer questions. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to tell the truth, but the oaths were binding unless they said \xe2\x80\x9cMayhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d so the trick was to say \xe2\x80\x9cMayhaps\xe2\x80\x9d so the lord of the crossing didn\xe2\x80\x99t notice, then knock the lord into the water and become the new lord of the crossing. In practice, the game came down to mostly shoving, hitting, and falling into the water, along with a lot of loud arguments about whether or not someone said \xe2\x80\x9cMayhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLittle Walder was lord of the crossing as often as not. He is Little Walder even though he is tall and stout with a big belly. His cousin, Big Walder, is sharp-faced and skinny and half a foot shorter. The names came about because Big Walder is fifty-two days older, so he was bigger at first. Big Walder explained that there were bunches of Walders at the Twins, as well as a number of girls named Walda, all named after the boys\xe2\x80\x99 grandfather, Lord [[Walder Frey]]. \n\nBran watched wistfully while the Walders played the lord of the crossing game with [[Turnip]] the cook\xe2\x80\x99s boy and [[Joseth]]\xe2\x80\x99s girls [[Bandy]] and [[Shyra]]. The Walders had decreed that Bran should judge whether people said \xe2\x80\x9cMayhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d but as soon as they started playing they forgot all about him. The shouts and splashes soon drew others: [[Palla]] the kennel girl, [[Cayn]]\xe2\x80\x99s boy [[Calon]], and [[Tomard|Fat Tom]]\xe2\x80\x99s son [[TomToo]]. Before long everyone was soaked, muddy, and laughing. Bran had not heard so much laughter since the bloody raven arrived. Bitterly, Bran told himself that no one would be lord of the crossing but him if he could use his legs. Then Rickon came running into the godswood with Shaggydog and wanted to play. Shaggydog obeyed the command to stay until the first time Little Walder hit Rickon with the stick. Then, before Bran could blink, the black wolf attacked Little Walder.\n\nOddly, after that Rickon decided he liked the Walders. They never played lord of the crossing again, but they play monsters and maidens, rats and cats, and come-into-my-castle. They plunder the kitchens, race around the walls, toss bones to the pups, and train with wooden swords. But when Rickon showed them the crypts under the castle, Bran had screamed that Rickon had no right to show them a Stark place.\n\n[[File:Winterfell by feliche.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Winterfell - by Feliche\xc2\xa9]]\n\nThe door to the bedchamber opens and Maester Luwin returns with Osha, Hayhead, and a sleeping draught. Osha scoops Bran up and carries him effortlessly to bed. Luwin assures Bran that the draught will give him a dreamless sleep. Bran wants to believe him. After he has taken the draught, Osha lingers behind to ask if it is the wolf dreams again. When Bran nods, Osha says he should not fight so hard, since maybe the [[old gods]] are trying to answer all his talk to the [[heart tree]]. Bran fades off to sleep before he can really reply, but when the darkness closes over him, he finds himself moving silently through the godswood. Part of him knows it is only a dream, but even the dream of walking is better than the truth of his bedchamber.\n\nIn his dream it is dark amongst the trees but the comet lights his way as he moves, swift and strong on four good legs. He can feel the ground underfoot and the smells fill his head. The scent of squirrel reminds him of the taste of hot blood and bones cracking between his teeth. Slaver runs from his jaws, and he can hear the squirrel chittering and rustling safe above him. He can smell his brother, too, loping around and around, tirelessly searching but never finding: for prey, for a way out, for his mother, for his littermates, for his pack.\n\nBehind the trees the walls rise higher than any wolf can leap. Cold iron and splintery wood close off the only exits, but his brother still stops at each one to fruitless bare his fangs in rage. He did the same the first night, but learned it was no good; circling the walls will not push them back and marking the trees will keep no men away. The world has tightened around them, but beyond the wall still stands Winterfell, and beyond that the true world calls him, and he knows he must answer or die.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n*[http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2010/02/bran-arya.html Humorous review of the chapter]\n*[http://slynt.blogspot.com/2011/04/re-read-bran-i.html Review of the chapter the course of a 10th reread] by Slynt.\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/01/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-3 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 04]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Bran Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Winterfell]]\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 4]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 05, Bran]]</text>\n      <sha1>plnrztz4yab79now63w1yijo4un8c81</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 11</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5700</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>107515</id>\n      <parentid>99341</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2013-09-13T23:38:25Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Arthur88</username>\n        <id>4619</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <comment>/* Synopsis */</comment>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4291">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]\n| place         = [[Inn of the Kneeling Man]]\n| title\t\t= Jaime II\n| page\t\t= 120\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 10|Davos II]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 11|Jaime II]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 12|Tyrion II]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 1|Jaime I]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 21|Jaime III]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n[[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]], [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]], and [[Cleos Frey|Cleos]] stop at the [[Inn of the Kneeling Man]] to eat. The innkeep mentions the [[Beric Dondarrion|Lightning Lord]], and we learn that Lord Beric and [[Thoros of Myr|Thoros]] are still together raiding in the [[Riverlands]]. The innkeep recommends they abandon their skiff and ride for [[King\'s Landing]]. Brienne buys the inn\xe2\x80\x99s horses for three gold and their skiff, getting robbed blind according to Jaime. The [[husband]] of the innkeeper recommends they follow a specific path to avoid outlaws, and they ride off. Jaime is impressed that Brienne takes the opposite path, realizing they might have been set up. \n\nThat night, Jaime reminisces of how he became a [[Kingsguard]]. [[Cersei Lannister|His sister]] was brought to court by [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]], who was [[Hand of the King|Hand]] at the time. He hoped to wed her to prince [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]]. Jaime was squiring for [[Sumner Crakehall]], and was knighted by [[Arthur Dayne]] during the battle against the [[Kingswood Brotherhood]]. Cersei later informed him that their father meant to wed him to [[Lysa Arryn]], and she told him that if he took the white cloak, they could be together in King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing. They did it behind their father\xe2\x80\x99s back, and Tywin could not object to King [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys]]\xe2\x80\x99 wishes. Tywin then resigned as Hand and took Cersei back to [[Casterly Rock]], unknowingly ruining their plan, for Jaime was now stuck in King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing as a sworn brother of the Kingsguard.\n\nYears later, when Aerys made the mistake of admitting Tywin\xe2\x80\x99s army, the Mad King called for the former Hand\xe2\x80\x99s head. Alone in the throne room, Aerys had one final plan, but Jaime arrived in his golden armor, the blood of Lord [[Rossart]] on his blade, and killed the King. Jaime had hoped to slip out unnoticed, but his father\xe2\x80\x99s men entered the throne room, and they thought Jaime meant to give the throne to his father, but Jaime told them he didn\xe2\x80\x99t care who was proclaimed king. He was waiting on the Iron Throne to see who would come to claim the kingdom, but it was [[Eddard Stark]] who found him there. Eddard said nothing but he saw the blood of the king Jaime had sworn to protect on Jaime\'s hands.

[[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] arrives to browbeat her into attending him in court. After court, Joffrey takes her to the ramparts to see the heads of her father and household. For a fleeting moment, Sansa has the opportunity to push Joffrey off the wall, but it disappears too soon.\n\n==Synopsis==    \n[[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] stays in her room in [[Red Keep#Maegor\xe2\x80\x99s Holdfast|Maegor\xe2\x80\x99s Holdfast]], sleeping, sobbing, and sleeping again. She does not eat the food the servants bring. When she dreams, she relives [[Eddard Stark|her father\xe2\x80\x99s]] beheading. She remembers wanting to look away, but not being able to. She remembers that all the people were screaming and she remembers [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] smiling and feeling safe until he said those words.\n\nSansa believes she will be executed and the thought does not bother her; she knows songs will be sung about her. She even considers throwing herself from her window, but cannot summon the courage and runs back to her bed sobbing. She dreams of footsteps that belong to Ser [[Ilyn Payne]] coming for her with [[Ice]]. In the dreams, when Ser Ilyn is at her door she realizes she is naked, and covers herself and screams out that she will be good. \n\nFinally, Joffrey arrives with [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]] and two others of the [[Kingsguard]]. Joffrey throws the curtains of the bed open and tells her that she will attend him in court that afternoon. Sansa begs him to leave her be, but Joffrey threatens to have his Hound force her. When she does not move, he orders the Hound to get her out of bed. She struggles as her blankets fall away to show that she only wears a thin bed gown. The Hound then tells her \xe2\x80\x9cDo as you are bid, child; dress.\xe2\x80\x9d He pushes her to the wardrobe almost gently. \n\nShe tells Joffrey that she did as she was asked and now only wants to go [[Winterfell|home]]. Joffrey tells her that he is still to marry her, so she will stay here. She responds that she does not want to marry him because he killed her father despite promising mercy. Joffrey insists he was merciful: he gave her father a clean death. Sansa now truly sees Joffrey for the first time, and cannot believe she ever found him handsome. Sansa whispers that she hates him. Joffrey tells her that his mother has said he should not strike his wife, so he orders Ser [[Meryn Trant]] to strike her with the back of his gloved fist. Sansa sprawls to the floor, her ear bloody. She agrees to attend court and everyone but the Hound leaves. The Hound tells her that she should save herself some pain and give Joffrey what he wants: she is to smile, smell sweet, and be his lady love.\n\nTwo maids creep timidly into the chamber. Sansa instructs them to prepare a bath and to get powder to hide the bruise on her face. She is amazed at how dirty her bathwater becomes, not having washed since her father\xe2\x80\x99s execution. She chooses the green silk gown she wore at the [[Tourney of the Hand]] when Joffery was sweet to her\xe2\x80\x94maybe he will remember and be gentle. \n\nSer Meryn escorts her to the throne room. From her observation of Ser Meryn, Sansa realizes that he feels nothing towards her; she is only an object. Sansa tells Ser Meryn that he is no true knight, which she thinks the Hound would find amusing, but she gets no reaction. \n\nShe is alone on the balcony as Joffrey dispenses what he considers justice. Mostly he lets his [[small council]] make the decisions, but when he intervenes he will not be dissuaded. She sees the ugly face of [[Janos Slynt]] at the council table and remembers how he threw down her father for Ser Ilyn to behead. She also notices how he nods approvingly at each of Joffrey\xe2\x80\x99s brutal judgements. She wishes some hero would cut off his head but knows there are no heroes, remembering [[Petyr Baelish]] telling her that life is not a song. Sansa thinks \xe2\x80\x9cIn life, the monsters win.\xe2\x80\x9d The last case is a singer accused of singing a song ridiculing King [[Robert Baratheon]]. He is made to sing the song before the court and Sansa thinks it is funny; in some verses it seems like he is singing about the queen. Joffrey gives the man the option of keeping his fingers or his tongue.\n\nWhen the court is dismissed, Sansa flees the balcony only to be met by Joffrey, Ser Meryn, and the Hound. Joffrey examines her and tells her she looks much better. Sansa thanks him with hollow words. Joffrey then tells her to walk with him\xe2\x80\x94the touch of his hand now makes her skin crawl. He asks her what she will get him for his coming name day, but Sansa admits that she was unaware it was near. Joffrey tells her that she is truly a stupid girl, and that his mother has said so and is worried their children will be stupid as well. Despite her expectations, the words still hurt Sansa and she realizes that the Hound was right: she is \xe2\x80\x9conly a little bird, repeating the words they taught her.\xe2\x80\x9d Joffrey then tells her that he will get her with child as soon as possible, and if the child is stupid, she will lose her head and he will find a smarter wife. He asks when she can have children and she tells him, not being able to look at him, that Septa [[Mordane]] told her twelve or thirteen.\n\nSansa now realizes they are going up onto the battlements and begs not to go there. Joffrey insists that he wants to show her how traitors are punished. He also threatens to have Ser Meryn drag her if she refuses. The Hound encourages her to go and Sansa realizes that one way or the other she must go up, so she goes willingly. It seems like she climbs a thousand steps to the top. Sansa looks out across the city to the countryside beyond and lets her imagination cross the hundreds of leagues north to her home in Winterfell. Joffrey demands to know what she is looking at and instructs her to look at the heads of her father, her septa, and a dozen more. Her father\xe2\x80\x99s head does not look recognizable or even real. Sansa decides that they can make her look, but they cannot make her see. Joffrey is disappointed by Sansa\xe2\x80\x99s hollow and stoic reaction. \n\nSansa cannot understand why they would kill Septa Mordane, but Joffrey insists she was a traitor as well. He asks again what Sansa will give him for his name day as a preamble to declaring that instead he will bring Sansa the head of her traitor brother [[Robb Stark|Robb]]. Joffrey explains that Robb used treachery and deceit to defeat his [[Jaime Lannister|Uncle Jaime]]. Sansa suggests that Robb may give her Joffrey\xe2\x80\x99s head. This mistake results in two harder blows by Ser Meryn. Joffrey commands her to clean off the blood.\n\nFor a fleeting moment, Sansa realizes that it would only take a shove to send Joffrey over the parapet to splatter far below. Just as suddenly, the moment is gone when the Hound comes between her and Joffrey to dab the blood from her broken lip with surprising gentleness. She thanks the Hound; she is a good girl and remembers her courtesies.\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Sansa Stark]]\n*[[Pycelle]]\n*[[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n*[[Sandor Clegane]]\n*[[Meryn Trant]]\n*[[Arys Oakheart]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Petyr Baelish]]\n*[[Cersei Lannister]]\n*[[Janos Slynt]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]] (dead)\n*[[Mordane|Septa Mordane]] (dead)\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Ilyn Payne]]\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n*[[Stannis Baratheon]]\n*[[Renly Baratheon]]\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n|}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/11/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-32 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.co.uk/2009/08/sansa-daenerys.html Humorous review of the chapter]\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/068/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 67]]    \n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Sansa Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 67]]\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 68, Sansa]]\n[[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\xa1\xd0\xb0\xd0\xbd\xd1\x81\xd0\xb0 VI]]</text>\n      <sha1>oulrhiu37vb58l6idufqtic4awbygai</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 46</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5806</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166483</id>\n      <parentid>118622</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-24T13:23:20Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Frernok</username>\n        <id>5007</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <comment>/*References and Notes*/</comment>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3247">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Samwell Tarly|Samwell]]\n| title\t\t= Samwell III\n| place         = abandoned village in the [[haunted forest]]\n| page\t\t= 528\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 45|Catelyn V]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 46|Samwell III]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 47|Arya IX]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 33|Samwell II]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 75|Samwell IV]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:Marc Fishman Coldhands.jpg|350px|thumb|left|[[Coldhands]] astride his great elk - Art by Marc Fishman \xc2\xa9]]\n[[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] and [[Gilly]] have reached what appears to be [[Whitetree]].

[[Asha Greyjoy|Asha]] is chained and carried on at the back of the baggage train under guard by [[Alysane Mormont]]. Stannis means to bring her to [[Winterfell]] to show off the Kraken\'s daughter as his captive and a sign of his strength. They believe the three hundred mile march through the [[Wolfswood]] should take them about fifteen days to Winterfell.\n\nShe bent her knee at Deepwood Motte, but thinks to herself that others have bent the knee before, such as [[Balon Greyjoy|Balon]], who rose again to fight another day. Wise advice years earlier from her father. As part of her surrender she hopes that Stannis will spare the rest of her [[ironborn]] their lives, which he does, imprisoning them at Deepwood Motte. She listens to talk between the northmen, seeing their pride in their king, though she predicts many if not all will die in a siege attempt of Winterfell. Ser [[Justin Massey]] takes a courteous nature with Asha, treating her well. She believes he is after her lands, but takes his company over being left alone.\n\nAfter a few nights, she is brought to Stannis and tries to treat with him. She says that his brother [[Robert Baratheon]] was renowned for turning his foes into friends, but learns that she should not speak his brothers name as it angers Stannis.\n\nThe snow begins to take a toll on the passage of the southern men, however the northmen are used to this weather and proceed quickly. Later she hears the queensmen, worshipers of the [[Lord of Light]], begin to contemplate a sacrifice to appease their god and blow the storm away. Stannis does not listen to them, nor does he listen to the pleas to make camp and wait out the storm. After fifteen days, the estimated time of arrival, they have only made half the distance through nine days of storm. After thirty days, they have yet to reach Winterfell. [[Morgan Liddle]], the man who nearly slayed her at Deepwood Motte, comes to apologize, but only for calling her a cunt, not for nearly killing her.\n\nLater they reach a small [[crofters\' village]] where they make camp and try to catch some fish. Asha realizes that Stannis is now a gaunt figure, having lost much weight on the march. They are encamped now and locked in by snow, unable to move. Worse, they have almost no provisions, and are starving.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n* [[Asha Greyjoy]]\n* [[Stannis]]\n* [[Robert Baratheon]]\n* [[Roose Bolton]]\n* [[Justin Massey]]\n* [[Balon Greyjoy]]\n* [[Eddard Stark]]\n* [[Qarl the Maid]]\n* [[Tristifer Botley | Tris]]\n* [[Cromm]]\n* [[Euron Greyjoy| Crow\'s Eye]]\n* [[Erik Ironmaker]]\n* [[Galbart Glover]]\n* [[Sybelle Locke|Lady Sybelle]]\n* [[Melisandre]]\n* [[Renly Baratheon]]\n* [[Morgan Liddle]]\n* [[Brandon Norrey]]\n* [[Hugo Wull]]\n* [[Artos Flint]]\n* [[Corliss Penny]]\n* [[Godry Farring]]\n* [[Arnolf Karstark]]\n* [[Harwood Fell]]\n* [[Mors Umber]]\n* [[Robin Peasebury]]\n* [[Richard Horpe]]\n* [[Mance Rayder]]\n* [[Alysane Mormont]]\n* [[Roggon Rustbeard|Roggon]]\n* [[Alannys Harlaw| Lady Alannys]]\n* [[Theon Greyjoy]]\n* [[Lyanna Mormont]]\n* [[Lyra Mormont]]\n* [[Jorelle Mormont|Jory Mormont]]\n* [[Dacey Mormont]]\n* [[Dagmer|Dagmer Cleftjaw]]\n* [[Rodrik Greyjoy]]\n* [[Maron Greyjoy]]\n* [[Benjicot Branch]]\n* [[Clayton Suggs]]\n* [[Aeron Greyjoy]]\n* [[Donnel Flint]]\n* [[Artos Flint]]\n}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 42]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Asha Greyjoy]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in the Wolfswood]]\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 42]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 43, La prise du roi]]</text>\n      <sha1>fxri3hoo4efvtoivoth9v54q3f889pb</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 34</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6858</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>193080</id>\n      <parentid>182255</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-09-10T13:08:22Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Gonzalo</username>\n        <id>4306</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <minor/>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4566">{{Infobox Chapter ADwD\n| pov\t\t= [[Bran Stark]]\n| place         = [[Cave of the three-eyed crow]]\n| title\t\t= Bran III\n| page\t\t= 448\n| previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 33|Tyrion VIII]]\n| current\t= Bran III\n| next\t\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 35|Jon VII]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 13|Bran II]]\n| arc next\t= \n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:Marc Fishman thevision.jpg|A white haired woman with a bronze sickle - by Marc Fishman \xc2\xa9 |thumb|250px|left]]\n[[Bran Stark|Bran]], [[Hodor]], [[Jojen Reed|Jojen]], and [[Meera Reed|Meera]] are still dwelling in the [[cave of the three-eyed crow|cave]] of the [[children of the Forest]] and exploring its chambers.

They begin to name some of the &quot;children&quot; as their own names are unpronounceable by the human tongue. Bran names one of the females [[Leaf]], as she is always adorned with leaves. She is one of the few children who can speak the [[Common Tongue]]. Others are called [[Ash]], [[Scales]], [[Black Knife]], [[Snowylocks]], and [[Coals]].\n\n[[Jojen Reed|Jojen]] is growing extremely sad and solemn, and still has fits of shaking. His sister [[Meera Reed|Meera]] does her best to keep up the spirits of both her brother and Bran.\n \nThe [[three-eyed crow]] teaches [[Bran Stark|Bran]] how to enter into ravens. He learns that all of the ravens around the three-eyed crow have children who have passed away and remain in the skins of these animals. He also learns to use [[weirwood]]s to look into the past. The three-eyed crow tells Bran that he was once a lord called Brynden. \n\nThe children feed Bran a bowl of [[weirwood paste]] to awaken his green seeing gifts. Bran sees his father, [[Eddard Stark|Eddard]], through [[Winterfell]]\'s heart tree, and learns that he can view the past, present and future through the weirwoods. The last greenseer tells Bran that he is haunted by his own ghosts, a brother that he loved, a brother that he hated, and a woman that he desired,&lt;ref&gt;If the Three-Eyed Crow is indeed [[Brynden Rivers]], as implied, then the loved brother is probably [[Daeron II Targaryen|Daeron II]], the hated brother is probably [[Aegor Rivers|Aegor &quot;Bittersteel&quot; Rivers]] or perhaps [[Daemon I Blackfyre|Daemon Blackfyre]], and the woman must be [[Shiera Seastar]]&lt;/ref&gt; but knows from experience that you cannot change the past. When he gets tired, he sends Bran away. Hodor carries Bran to his bed. \n\nIn his sleep, Bran sees the following visions through Winterfell\'s heart tree:\n* His young [[Ned Stark|father]] praying with a bowed head &quot;\xe2\x80\xa6let them grow up close as brothers, with only love between them, and let my [[Catelyn Stark|lady wife]] find it in her heart to forgive.&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;Probably shortly after his return from [[Robert\'s Rebellion]], referring to [[Robb Stark]] and [[Jon Snow]]&lt;/ref&gt;\n* A girl and a younger boy play fighting with branches;&lt;ref&gt;Possibly Bran\'s uncle [[Benjen Stark]] and late aunt [[Lyanna Stark]]; Bran finds the girl to be alike to his sister [[Arya Stark|Arya]], who is said to remind people of a young Lyanna as per \'\'[[A Game of Thrones]]\'\', [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 22|Chapter 22]]&lt;/ref&gt;\n* A pregnant woman coming out of the black pool praying for a son to avenge her;\n* A slender girl on her toes kissing a [[knight]] as tall as Hodor;&lt;ref&gt;It is believed to be [[Dunk]] kissing a young woman, possibly a young [[Old Nan]], at Winterfell, foreshadowing the next [[Dunk and Egg]] story, \'\'[[The She-Wolves of Winterfell]]\'\'.&lt;/ref&gt;\n* A pale, dark-eyed youth cutting three branches from the weirwood and shaping them into arrows;\n* Other lords of Winterfell: tall, hard, stern men in fur and chain mail; \n* A bearded man forcing a captive down on his knees, and a white-haired woman killing the captive with a bronze sickle.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Bran Stark]]\n* [[Jojen Reed]]\n* [[Meera Reed]]\n* [[Leaf]]\n* [[Summer]]\n* [[Hodor]]\n* [[three-eyed crow| Three-eyed Crow (Lord Brynden)]]\n* [[Snowylocks]]\n* [[Eddard Stark]] \n* [[Arya Stark]] \n* [[Ash]] \n* [[Scales]] \n* [[Black Knife]] \n* [[Coals]]\n* [[Jon Stark]]\n* [[Sansa Stark]]\n* [[Rickon Stark]]\n* [[Maester Luwin]]\n* [[Robb Stark]]\n}}\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 34]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Bran Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place Beyond the Wall]]\n\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 34]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 35, Bran]]</text>\n      <sha1>a8h8mar8gg64mfpq6zjl75dygk8qrem</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 31</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5771</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>164455</id>\n      <parentid>140766</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-04-12T16:44:25Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Frernok</username>\n        <id>5007</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <comment>/*References and Notes*/</comment>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2909">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]\n| title\t\t= Jaime IV\n| place         = [[Harrenhal]]\n| page\t\t= 342\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 30|Jon IV]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 31|Jaime IV]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 32|Tyrion IV]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 21|Jaime III]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 37|Jaime V]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\nOn the way to [[Harrenhal]], [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]\'s wound is infected, and he is feverish from the loss of his hand (which has been cut off by [[Zollo]]).

He recalls that when [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys]]  cooked Lord [[Rickard Stark]] alive while [[Brandon Stark|Brandon]] died trying to rescue him, Jaime did the same. Brienne is stubborn and wants to resist. Jaime saves her again by yelling \xe2\x80\x9csapphires\xe2\x80\x9d loud enough for the [[Vargo Hoat|Goat]] to hear. Brienne thanks him as Jaime considers the debt (revenge) that he owes to Vargo Hoat and his Bloody Mummers: a [[House Lannister|Lannister]] always pays his debts.\n\nAfter reaching Harrenhal, Hoat presents the Kingslayer to [[Roose Bolton]], who is disgusted that the Mummers hacked off his hand.

The [[Night\'s Watch]] ship \'\'[[Blackbird]]\'\' will take them only so far as Braavos, and then Sam will need to find tender there bound for [[Oldtown]]. Sam is hopeful that the others making the journey with him will find happiness when they reach their destination: Gilly and the babe at [[Horn Hill]], Maester [[Aemon Targaryen (son of Maekar I)|Aemon]] back at the [[Citadel]], and [[Dareon]] in his new role as a recruiter. The old maester tells them the story of his sea trip to the Wall- how he traveled with Lord Commander [[Duncan the Tall]] as his honor guard, along with [[Brynden Rivers]], Lord Bloodraven himself, who was sent by [[Aegon V Targaryen|Egg]] to serve out the remainder of his life in the Watch.\n\nAs the trip progresses, Sam finds that nothing he says can console Gilly, and that Maester Aemon\'s health deteriorates. Dareon has nothing but scorn for the [[wildling]] girl, but Aemon tells Sam to look closely at the baby to find the source of Gilly\'s grief. When Sam realizes that the baby is actually [[Dalla]] and [[Mance Rayder]]\'s, not her own, he can\'t believe what [[Jon Snow|Jon]] did. Maester Aemon states, &quot;What threats the Lord Commander made, what promises, I can only guess.&quot; And while Sam understands that Jon did so to save the baby from [[Melisandre]]\'s fires, he remains shocked at what cost this will have for Gilly.\n\n==References and Notes==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/04/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-feast-for-crows-part-11 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Feast for Crows, Part 11].

He and [[Lark]] the Sisterman are conspiring to desert the [[Night\'s Watch]], along with [[Small Paul]] and about a dozen other sworn brothers. The traitors plan to kill Lord Commander [[Jeor Mormont|Mormont]] and several other officers to prevent anyone from actively seeking them out after they desert. \n\n[[Thoren Smallwood]] and his party are the only of the three rangings to return so far, and they have seen the size of [[Mance Rayder]]\xe2\x80\x99s army. Thoren wishes to give battle to Mance\xe2\x80\x99s army, mainly because there are so few warriors in it, it\'s composed of mostly women and children. Chett and his men plan to kill in the dead of night, and flee to places of safety, leaving Thoren Smallwood and [[Ottyn Wythers]] as senior rangers. Thoren won\xe2\x80\x99t search for them because he wants to lead the attack, and Wythers would rather flee to the Wall and could not care less about deserters. That evening, the Watch gathers before Mormont and his senior men, who announce that they will march in force against the [[wildling]] army, which is about ten days away. Mormont acknowledges that they might all die and has his men reaffirm their oaths to the Night\'s Watch. Meanwhile, Chett worries that some of his deserters may lose their resolve. \n\nLate in the night, Chett awakens to find it snowing. The desertion plans are ruined because the turn cloaks can be easily tracked in the fresh snow. Chett still seeks to get some satisfaction from the night and creeps over to the sleeping Samwell Tarly, with the intention of murdering him. He is interrupted as a ranger in the distance sounds his horn. Sam awakens, and he and Chett hear the horn blow three times. Both men are shocked at the realization of what three horn blows mean, a signal that has not been used in hundreds and thousands of years. Three horn blows mean [[Others]]. Chett looks down and realizes he has wet himself.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Chett]]\n*[[Jon Snow]]\n*[[Samwell Tarly]]\n*[[Aemon Targaryen (son of Maekar I)]]\n*[[Lark]]\n*[[Small Paul]]\n*[[Jeor Mormont]]\n*[[Thoren Smallwood]]\n*[[Mance Rayder]]\n*[[Ottyn Wythers]]\n}}\t\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Night\'s Watch]]\n*[[Wildling]]\n*[[Others]]\n}}\n\n\n==References and Notes==\n* The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Storm of Swords: Chapter 00Prologue]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV miscellaneous|A Storm of Swords: Prologue]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in the Fist of the First Men]]\n\n*[http://slynt.blogspot.nl/2012/05/re-read-prologue-storm-of-swords.html Analyses and summary of the chapter] in the course of a 10th reread by Slynth.\n* [http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/09/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-1 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler. \n[[es:Tormenta de Espadas-Pr\xc3\xb3logo]]\n[[fr:A Storm of Swords, Chapitre 01, Pr\xc3\xa9lude]]\n[[zh:&amp;#20912;&amp;#38632;&amp;#30340;&amp;#39118;&amp;#26292;-&amp;#24207;&amp;#31456;]]</text>\n      <sha1>b5f7a8j9r07eoynwha6d0yzdjwxa1sq</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Game of Thrones-Chapter 44</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6028</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>165987</id>\n      <parentid>108749</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-17T14:20:46Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7377">{{Infobox Chapter AGoT\n| pov\t\t= [[Sansa Stark]]\n| place         = [[King\'s Landing]]\n| title\t\t= Sansa III\n| page\t\t= 394\n| previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 43|Eddard XI]]\n| current\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 44|Sansa III]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 45|Eddard XII]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 29|Sansa II]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 51|Sansa IV]]\n}} __NOTOC__\n\n[[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] wonders with [[Jeyne Poole]] why [[Eddard Stark|her father]] did not send the gallant Ser [[Loras Tyrell|Loras]] to kill the monster Ser [[Gregor Clegane|Gregor]]. The next day her father reveals that he is sending her and [[Arya Stark|Arya]] back to [[Winterfell]]. Sansa insists that she cannot leave because she is to marry Prince [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], who is nothing like [[Robert Baratheon|his father]] and will give her children with golden hair. This is an epiphany to her father.\n\n==Synopsis==  \nSansa is bewildered that [[Eddard Stark|her father]] did not send the [[Loras Tyrell|Knight of Flowers]] after Ser [[Gregor Clegane]]. She tells her friend [[Jeyne Poole]] that she thinks it is because her father was in a foul mood from his leg wound. Sansa believes sending Ser Loras, who looks like a hero, to slay the monstrous Ser Gregor would have been just like the tales. Sansa tells Jeyne that she said as much to Septa [[Mordane]], but that the septa only told her not to question her father\xe2\x80\x99s decisions. [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]], who had overheard, claimed that her father\xe2\x80\x99s decisions could do with a bit of questioning. When Sansa had explained to him about monsters and heroes, Littlefinger told her life was not a song.\n\nJeyne suggests that Lord Eddard should have sent Ser [[Ilyn Payne]], but Sansa replies that he is like a second monster. Then Jeyne begins to speak dreamily about Lord [[Beric Dondarrion]], telling Sansa how brave and gallant he is. Sansa can only think that even though Lord Beric is handsome, he is also old: almost 22. \n\nChanging the subject, Sansa tells Jeyne that she has had a dream about Prince [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] taking the white hart the king\xe2\x80\x99s party is hunting in the [[Kingswood]]; it was actually only a wish, but Sansa thinks it sounds better to call it a dream. In her heart, Sansa thinks that her prince is far worthier than his drunken father. Jeyne asks if Joffrey just touched the hart in the dream, since that is what heroes always do in the stories, but Sansa insists that Joffrey shot it with a golden arrow and brought it back for her because she knows Joffrey likes hunting and killing.\n\nSansa does not think Joffrey had anything to do with killing her father\xe2\x80\x99s men; that was all his uncle [[Jaime Lannister]]\xe2\x80\x99s doing. She knows her father is still angry about it, but believes that blaming Joffrey would be like blaming her for something [[Arya Stark|Arya]] did. The mention of Arya leads Jeyne to speak of how she saw Arya walking on her hands. Both agree that they cannot understand why Arya does anything.\n\nNext Sansa tells Jeyne about [[Yoren]] coming before the throne to ask for more men to man [[the Wall]]. After seeing the dirty, smelly [[Night\'s Watch]] recruiter (nothing like her [[Benjen Stark|Uncle Benjen]]), Sansa felt sorry for her bastard brother [[Jon Snow]]. No one would volunteer for the Watch, so her father gave Yoren his pick of the dungeons. Jeyne soon interrupts Sansa to suggest they go to the kitchen to get some lemon cakes and Sansa agrees.\n\nThe next morning Sansa wakes to watch Lord Beric depart with his men and thinks it is a song come to life. Afterward, the [[Tower of the Hand]] is so empty Sansa is even happy to see Arya. Arya asks if the men have gone to hunt down Jaime Lannister, and Sansa explains that they have gone for Ser Gregor Clegane. Sansa then asks Septa Mordane whether they will put the Mountain\xe2\x80\x99s head on a spike over his own gate or bring it back to [[King\'s Landing]]. The septa is horrified that Sansa would discuss such a thing over breakfast.\n\nArya wonders why men were not sent after Jaime Lannister, since he killed [[Jory Cassel]] and the others, or after [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]] for killing her friend [[Mycah]]. Sansa declares that it is not the same thing because Mycah attacked Joffrey. Arya erupts, shouting that Sansa is a liar. Sansa responds snobbishly that Arya can say whatever she wants but will still have to bow and call her \xe2\x80\x9cYour Grace\xe2\x80\x9d after she marries Joffrey. Arya throws an orange at Sansa, staining her beautiful ivory dress and driving Sansa to declare that it should have been Arya they killed, not [[Lady (direwolf)|Lady]]. The septa orders both of them to their rooms, where Sansa tears off her stained clothes and goes to sleep.\n\nSansa is dreaming of Lady when Septa Mordane wakes her and brings her to her father. Once Arya is brought, Sansa immediately claims that Arya started the fight and ruined her dress. Eddard silences Sansa and Arya takes the opportunity to apologize and ask for Sansa\xe2\x80\x99s forgiveness. Sansa is dumbfounded but eventually asks about her dress. Arya offers to wash it, or failing that to sew her a new one. \n\nEddard interrupts to tell them that he did not call them in to talk about dresses but to inform them that he is sending them back to [[Winterfell]]. Both sisters exclaim their unhappiness, and Eddard laughs that at last they can agree upon something. Sansa insists that she has done nothing wrong and tells her father to send Arya away since she started it. Eddard explains that he is not sending them away as a punishment, but to keep them safe. \n\nSansa insists that she cannot go; she is to marry Prince [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], whom she loves as much as Queen [[Naerys Targaryen|Naerys]] loved Prince [[Aemon Targaryen|Aemon]]. She wants to be his queen and have his babies. Eddard assures Sansa that he will find her an appropriate match and that Joffrey is no Prince Aemon. Sansa insists that she wants Joffrey and that she will give him a son with beautiful golden hair who will be the greatest king there ever was, as brave as a [[House Stark|wolf]] and as proud as a [[House Lannister|lion]]. Arya points out that Joffrey is not a lion, but a [[House Baratheon|stag]] like his father, and a craven and a liar besides. Sansa cries out\n\n{{Quote|He is \'\'\'not!\'\'\' He\'s not the least bit like that old drunken king.}}\n\nEddard gets a strange look on his face before telling them that they will sail as soon as he can find a ship. He also warns them not to tell anybody. Septa Mordane returns to urge Sansa to stop crying while Arya insists that a journey by ship will be an adventure and that they will get to see everybody back at Winterfell again. Sansa remains furious and storms off to her bedchamber and bars the door. \n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/09/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-22 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/045/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==    \n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 44]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Sansa Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 45, Sansa]][[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\xa1\xd0\xb0\xd0\xbd\xd1\x81\xd0\xb0 III]]</text>\n      <sha1>81ch4wvazf3d4o9vosp0393dyqp51ex</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 59</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5814</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>122048</id>\n      <parentid>118676</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2014-03-30T15:00:18Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Scafloc</username>\n        <id>28</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2800">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]]\n| title\t\t= Sansa IV\n| place         = [[King\'s Landing]]\n| page\t\t= 659\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 58|Tyrion VII]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 59|Sansa IV]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 60|Tyrion VIII]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 28|Sansa III]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 61|Sansa V]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] has learned from [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] the fate of her [[Robb Stark|brother]] and [[Catelyn Tully|mother]] at the [[Red Wedding]].

Tyrion presents his nephew with a copy of Grand Maester [[Kaeth]]\xe2\x80\x99s [[Lives of Four Kings]], one of only four copies in existence written by Kaeth himself. [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]] tells the King it is &quot;A book every king should read.&quot; Joffrey is disappointed with the gift, and hacks the book in half with the [[Widow\'s Wail|Valyrian sword]] his [[Tywin Lannister|grandfather]] had just given him. Joffrey remarks that he is no stranger to [[Valyrian steel]], and also that Tyrion owes him another gift.  Tyrion suggests a Valyrian dagger with a a [[dragonbone]] hilt, which seems to unsettle Joffrey for a moment before he says it is a good idea but wants one with a gold hilt instead. \n\nLater, back in their rooms, Sansa tells Tyrion that she would rather not know how Robb and her mother had perished, and Tyrion promises that he will say no more.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Sansa Stark]]\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Catelyn Tully]]\n*[[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n*[[Kaeth]]\n*[[Kevan Lannister]]\n*[[Tywin Lannister]]\n*[[Oberyn Martell]]\n*[[Ellaria Sand]]\n}}\t\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Red Wedding]]\n*[[War of Conquest]]\n*[[Lives of Four Kings]]\n*[[Widow\'s Wail]]\n*[[Valyrian steel]]\n*[[Dragonbone]]\n}}\n\n\n==References and Notes==\n*The synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/07/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-36 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Part 36].

The Red Woman tells Davos that her purpose is to keep darkness at bay. When Davos asks about the shadow she birthed, she tells him that [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] is too weak, and should she draw more life-energy from him he would die. Melisandre tells Davos that there are only two gods, [[R\'hllor]] and the [[Great Other]], whose name cannot be spoken. They are opposites, white and black, good and evil, fire and ice. The Other is the god of Darkness, the Soul of Ice and his war with R\xe2\x80\x99hllor is everywhere and everlasting. Melisandre claims that the [[Others|Other\xe2\x80\x99s]] servants often hide in plain view, but the priests of R\xe2\x80\x99hllor can see through falsehoods. She explains that she saw in the flames that Davos wanted to murder her. Davos admits to this, blaming her for the death of his sons who died in the [[Battle of the Blackwater]]. Melisandre speaks of a prophesy, which portends that [[Azor Ahai]] will be born again in the light of R\xe2\x80\x99hllor, and she is convinced that Stannis is the embodiment of this prophecy: &quot;When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone.&quot; Melisandre departs, telling him that he (Davos) has served R\xe2\x80\x99hllor once and will do so again. \n\nLater, [[Axell Florent]] brings his brother [[Alester Florent|Alester]], Stannis\xe2\x80\x99 [[Hand of the King|Hand]], and tosses him into the cell with Davos. Lord Florent is a defeated man, and he tells Davos that his nephew [[Imry Florent|Imry]] died with the fleet, and that most of Stannis\xe2\x80\x99 bannermen were captured at the battle and bent the knee to [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]]. He is now condemned as a traitor for writing a letter he planned to send to Lord [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]], offering peace and suggesting that Stannis would swear fealty to Joffrey but would remain Lord of Dragonstone and [[Storm\'s End]], and that the Florents would get [[Brightwater Keep]] back. In addition, he offered [[Shireen Baratheon|Shireen]]\xe2\x80\x99s hand in marriage to [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]]. Alester rants about Melisandre\xe2\x80\x99s talk of a stone dragon, &quot;madness, sheer madness. Did we learn nothing from [[Aerion Targaryen|Aerion Brightfire]], from the nine mages, from the alchemists? Did we learn nothing from [[Summerhall]]? No good has ever come from these dreams of dragons.&quot; Davos knows Stannis well and tells Florent that Stannis would rather die a king than bend his knee, and that he would never consent to wed his daughter to Tommen, a child born of incest.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Davos Seaworth]]\n*[[Melisandre]]\n*[[Stannis Baratheon]]\n*[[Azor Ahai]]\n*[[Axell Florent]]\n*[[Alester Florent]]\n*[[Imry Florent]]\n*[[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n*[[Tywin Lannister]]\n*[[Shireen Baratheon]]\n*[[Tommen Baratheon]]\n*[[Aerion Targaryen]] Brightflame\n}}\t\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Dragonstone]]\n*[[R\'hllor]]\n*[[Great Other]]\n*[[Others]]\n*[[Battle of the Blackwater]]\n*[[Hand of the King]]\n*[[Storm\'s End]]\n*[[Brightwater Keep]]\n*[[Summerhall]]\n}}\n\n\n==References and Notes==      \n* The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].   \n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/01/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-15 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Part 15].

After reading the proposed alliance with [[Robb Stark]], Balon throws it in the fire and insists he will pay the [[Old Way|iron price]] and carve out a kingdom of his own.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n[[File:Pyke by Feliche.jpg|thumb|400px|left|Pyke, the seat of House Greyjoy - Feliche\xc2\xa9]]\n\nThere is no safe anchorage at [[Pyke]], but [[Theon Greyjoy]] insists the \'\'[[Myraham]]\'\' pass by so he can watch his home rise just as it dwindled when he was taken away as a ward of [[Eddard Stark]]. Theon cannot make out the banner above the [[Pyke#Sea Tower|Sea Tower]], but he knows it is the golden kraken of [[House Greyjoy]]. In the sky beyond the castle, the [[red comet]] is still visible. Theon decides it is his comet, sliding a hand to the letter from [[Robb Stark]] that he considers as good as a crown.\n\nThe [[Daughter of the captain of the Myraham|captain\'s daughter]], Theon\'s lover during the voyage, asks if the castle is as he remembers it. Theon confesses it looks smaller, and explains the hard life of the Iron Islanders to her. The girl asks to come ashore with him, but Theon rebuffs her, explaining that the days are gone when the ironborn could take [[salt wives]] they captured on raids. She insists that she could be his salt wife, but Theon says her place is on the \'\'Myraham\'\'.\n\n[[File:Balon Greyjoy.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Balon Greyjoy, Lord Reaper of Pyke - Amok\xc2\xa9]]\n\nIn the harbor of Lordsport, Theon notices at least fifty or sixty longships including those of Houses [[House Goodbrother|Goodbrother]], [[House Wynch|Wynch]], and [[House Harlaw|Harlaw]]. He cannot see his uncle [[Euron Greyjoy|Euron]]\'s \'\'[[Silence]]\'\', but he does spy his father\'s \'\'[[Great Kraken]]\'\'. It is obvious the longships are hosting, and Theon wonders if his father anticipated his message and called his banners.\n\nThere is no honor guard to escort Theon, and the waiting merchants are unimpressed when the captain announces him. He orders a horse from an innkeeper, who does not recognize his importance. The transaction is interrupted by a priest of the [[Drowned God]], who says he will escort his nephew. Theon does not recognize the grim, bearded priest until he remembers his father writing that his uncle [[Aeron Greyjoy]] sank in a storm and turning holy when he washed up.\n\nHurrying after his uncle, Theon finds that the priest\'s cold manner is totally unlike the amiable man Theon remembers. Abruptly, Aeron asks if Theon prays to the [[House Stark|Stark]] [[old gods|gods]] now, and Theon (who seldom prays at all) says no. Aeron commands Theon to kneel in the mud. Deciding he may need his uncle\'s help later, Theon acquiesces. Aeron drenches his head with seawater from a waterskin, reconsecrating him to the Drowned God.\n\nAeron informs Theon that his [[Alannys Harlaw|mother]] now lives on [[Harlaw]] because of her health and his sister [[Asha Greyjoy|Asha]] has taken \'\'[[Black Wind]]\'\' to [[Great Wyk]] with a message. Theon asks why his father has assembled his forces, but Aeron insists Balon commanded secrecy.\n\nThey reach Pyke at sunset, and Theon climbs to the solar where his father waits. Lord Balon is smaller, gaunter, and greyer than Theon remembers him. Balon asks what Theon is now, and Theon replies he is a man and Balon\'s heir. Balon only says they will see.\n\nBalon accuses Theon of dressing like a woman in velvets and silks, and asks if the gold chain around his neck was bought with iron or gold. Theon only then remembers that the Old Way stipulates a warrior may only wear jewelry taken from enemies he has slain. Theon blushes and his father yanks the chain off, declaring that his daughter has taken an axe for a lover, and he will not have his son dressed like a whore. Balon decides the Starks have made Theon theirs.\n\nThe letter fails to impress Balon; he summarizes it as being given a crown for destroying Robb\'s enemies. Theon attempts to explain, but his father insists that what is meant is what is said, and what is given can be taken away. Balon throws the letter into the fire and backhands Theon when he protests. He declares no man gives him a crown, and he will pay the iron price and take his crown by conquest as [[Urron Redhand]] did 5,000 years ago.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n===See also===\n* [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2011/06/re-read-theon-i-homecoming-queen.html Review of the chapter] in the course of a tenth reread. \n*[http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2010_03_01_archive.html Humorous review and summary of the chapter] by Jason.\xc2\xa0\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/02/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-6 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 11]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Theon Greyjoy]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Pyke]]\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 11]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 12, Theon]]</text>\n      <sha1>kgeopdrv124w9u9tuamb6wk83j7s2pf</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 6</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6812</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>184400</id>\n      <parentid>166534</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-05-25T19:21:27Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Dancing Maester</username>\n        <id>6281</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <minor/>\n      <comment>/* Synopsis */</comment>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3334">{{Infobox Chapter ADwD\n| pov\t\t= [[Quentyn Martell]]\n| place         = [[Volantis]]\n| title\t\t= The Merchant\'s Man\n| page\t\t= 83\n| previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 5|Tyrion II]]\n| current\t= The Merchant\'s Man\n| next\t\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 7|Jon II]]\n| arc previous\t= \n| arc next\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 25|The Windblown]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Quentyn Martell]], son of the [[Doran Martell|Prince of Dorne]], is in [[Volantis]], disguised as a wineseller\'s servant. He and his servant are attempting to book a passage to [[Meereen]] aboard ship, but even in the massive port of Volantis they are unable to find a single ship willing to risk the trip to [[Slaver\'s Bay]] while there is war brewing and the [[slavery|slave trade]] and [[fighting pits]] are both terminated.{{Ref|aSoS|71}}&lt;ref&gt;Pages 85-86&lt;/ref&gt; Quentyn is anxious trying to get to [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] in Meereen as his father commanded, intent on marrying her. He has heard that she is the most beautiful woman in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Page 84&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nQuentyn is accompanied by [[Gerris Drinkwater]], acting as his merchant master, and [[Archibald Yronwood]]. On the trip from [[Dorne]] aboard the [[Meadowlark]] they were attacked by corsairs from the [[Disputed Lands]], losing their Maester [[Kedry]], [[Willam Wells]] and his dear friend [[Cletus Yronwood]]. Quentyn feels their loss keenly, and feels in dire need of his missing maester\'s counsel.&lt;ref&gt;Page 87&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nQuentyn and Gerris meet with the captain of the \'\'[[Adventure]]\'\', a smuggler\'s ship, who agrees to take them to Meereen only if they are prepared to pay three times the normal fare - for each of them. Quentyn knows that the man simply plans to take their money and either kill them or enslave them at the first chance he gets.&lt;ref&gt;Pages 86 and 94&lt;/ref&gt; \n\nThe pair debate whether they should give up their quest and return to Dorne, or attempt to travel to Meereen overland via the [[demon road]].&lt;ref&gt;Page 89&lt;/ref&gt; Quentyn is anxious not to have any more deaths on his conscience, but he feels his duty to Dorne and to his father is too important to turn back. They travel through the streets to the [[Merchant\'s House]] to meet with Archibald Yronwood.  Along the way, they encounter a party of [[Windblown]] who are recruiting soldiers as they head to [[Yunkai]] to war against [[Astapor]] and [[Meereen]]. Quentyn tells him that they have no choice but to board \'\'Adventure\'\' - but Archibald says there is another way to Meereen, less honorable, but faster than the demon road...\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Quentyn Martell]]\n*[[Doran Martell]]\n*[[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n*[[Gerris Drinkwater]]\n*[[Archibald Yronwood]]\n*[[Kedry]]\n*[[Willam Wells]]\n*[[Cletus Yronwood]]\n}}\t\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Volantis]]\n*[[Meereen]]\n*[[Slaver\'s Bay]]\n*[[Dorne]]\n*[[Meadowlark]]\n*[[Disputed Lands]]\n*[[Adventure]]\n*[[Demon road]]\n*[[Merchant\'s House]]\n*[[Windblown]]\n*[[Yunkai]]\n*[[Astapor]]\n}}\n\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 06]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Quentyn Martell]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Volantis]]\n\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 6]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 07, Le domestique du marchand]]</text>\n      <sha1>9rmqrwvga32niwe9xf6zw06ib63sht4</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Feast for Crows-Chapter 35</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5975</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>183778</id>\n      <parentid>183758</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-05-08T21:11:25Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3335">{{Infobox Chapter AFfC\n| pov\t\t= [[Samwell Tarly]]\n| title\t\t= Samwell IV\n| place         = sailing off the coast of [[Dorne]]\n| page\t\t= 519\n| previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 34|Cat of the Canals]]\n| current\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 35|Samwell IV]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 36|Cersei VIII]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 26|Samwell III]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 45|Samwell V]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis== \n\nThe \'\'[[Cinnamon Wind]]\'\' is somewhere off the coast of [[Dorne]] as [[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] leads a prayer service to mourn the passing of [[Aemon Targaryen (son of Maekar I)|Aemon Targaryen]]. [[Xhondo]]\'s information on the three dragons had given Maester Aemon a second wind, but it was not enough. Sam recalls some of the ancient [[maester]]\'s words during the sea voyage from [[Braavos]], &quot;No one ever looked for a girl. It was a prince that was promised... [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]], I thought... The error crept in from the translation. [[Dragon|Dragons]] are neither male nor female... [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] is the one, born amidst salt and smoke... Lady [[Melisandre]] has misread the signs. [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] has some of the dragon blood in him, yes... [[Rhaelle Targaryen|Rhaelle]], [[Aegon V Targaryen|Egg]]\'s little girl, she was how they (the Baratheons) came by it... They must send her a maester. Daenerys must be counseled, taught, protected...&quot; Aemon begged Sam to convince the archmaesters of this, and later rambled some of the following (perhaps prophetic) lines: &quot;a glass candle that could not be lit; eggs that would not hatch; the sphinx was the riddle, not the riddler.&quot;\n                     \n[[Gilly]] and Sam sit together after the eulogy, drinking rum. Gilly points out that had Aemon remained on the [[Wall]], Melisandre might have sacrificed him for his king\'s blood. [[Jon Snow|Jon]] must have known this, and sent the old maester, as well as [[Dalla]]\'s boy, to save them from the Red Woman\'s fires. Gilly then says that she will name the boy Aemon Steelsong once he reaches the age of two. Below decks, Sam and Gilly have sex, although he is consumed by guilt for forsaking his vows. Afterwards, Sam tries to avoid Gilly, but [[Kojja Mo|Kojja]] corners him and tells him that what he and Gilly did was considered holy in the [[Summer Islands]], a way of honoring the dead by celebrating life. Kojja advises Sam that Gilly knows they can never be man and wife, but there was nothing wrong with them comforting each other on the long journey. Sam is persuaded, but perhaps it is because Kojja threatens to throw him overboard if he does not continue sleeping with Gilly.\n\n==References and Notes== \n*The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/08/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-feast-for-crows-part-25 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Feast for Crows, Part 25].

She is escorted to the party by [[Loras Tyrell|Loras]], and unknowingly upsets him by talking of [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]]\xe2\x80\x99s death. The party is held in the [[Red Keep#Maidenvault|Maidenvault]], where King [[Baelor I Targaryen|Baelor the Blessed]] confined his sisters so they would not tempt him, as he had sworn a vow of celibacy. She is introduced to all of Margaery\xe2\x80\x99s cousins and companions, but it is the Queen of Thorns who takes the most interest in Sansa. \n\nLady Olenna reveals that the [[House Baratheon|Baratheons]] have [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] blood, and that the [[House Tyrell|Tyrell]] claim to [[Highgarden]] has always been shaky since several other houses in [[the Reach]] can claim descent from [[Garth Gardener (Greenhand)|Garth Greenhand]] as well. The old woman makes it known that [[Mace Tyrell|her son]] is an oaf for making this alliance with the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]], and she wishes to learn from Sansa the truth of what [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] is. Sansa fears that [[Varys]] is listening, but Lady Olenna commands [[Butterbumps]] to sing at the top of his voice. Sansa reveals the truth about Joffrey to the Queen of Thorns and Margaery, telling them that the King is a monster and that she fears for Margaery. Lady Olenna assures Sansa that the wedding will still go on, as Mace is determined that his daughter wed the King. The Queen of Thorns offers Sansa a proposal to visit Highgarden after the wedding, and wishes Sansa to marry her grandson [[Willas Tyrell|Willas]].\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Sansa Stark]]\n*[[Loras Tyrell]]\n*[[Balon Swann]]\n*[[Tallad]]\n*[[Kennos of Kayce]]\n*[[Osney Kettleblack]]\n*[[Osfryd Kettleblack]]\n*[[Morros Slynt]]\n*[[Garlan Tyrell]]\n*[[Arryk (Guard)|Arryk]]\n*[[Erryk (Guard)|Erryk]]\n*[[Margaery Tyrell]]\n*[[Alerie Hightower|Alerie Tyrell]]\n*[[Megga Tyrell]]\n*[[Alla Tyrell]]\n*[[Elinor Tyrell]]\n*[[Janna Tyrell|Janna Fossoway]]\n*[[Leonette Fossoway|Leonette Tyrell]]\n*[[Nysterica|Septa Nysterica]]\n*[[Alyce Graceford]]\n*[[Alysanne Bulwer]]\n*[[Meredyth Crane]]\n*[[Taena of Myr|Taena Merryweather]]\n*[[Olenna Redwyne|Olenna Tyrell]]\n*[[Butterbumps]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n*[[Sandor Clegane]]\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Florian the Fool|Florian]]\n*[[Dontos Hollard]]\n*[[Robar Royce]]\n*[[Renly Baratheon]]\n*[[Mace Tyrell]]\n*[[Baelor I Targaryen|Baelor the Blessed]]\n*[[Luthor Tyrell]]\n*[[Rickard Stark]]\n*[[Hoster Tully]]\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n*[[Tommen Baratheon]]\n*[[Stannis Baratheon]]\n*[[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Dragon]]\n*[[Mern IX Gardener]]\n*[[Garth Gardener (Greenhand)|Garth Greenhand]]\n*[[Varys]]\n*[[Moon Boy]]\n*[[Aerion Targaryen|Aerion Brightfire]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n*[[Ilyn Payne]]\n*[[Mycah]]\n*[[Lady (direwolf)|Lady]]\n*[[Cersei Lannister]]\n*[[Willas Tyrell]]\n*[[Oberyn Martell]]\n|}\n\n==Places and Terms Mentioned==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[Aegon\'s High Hill]]\n*[[King\xe2\x80\x99s Gate]]\n*[[Red Keep]]\n*[[King\'s Landing]]\n*[[Red Keep#Maegor\'s Holdfast|Maegor\'s Holdfast]]\n*[[Red Keep#Tower of the Hand|Tower of the Hand]]\n*[[Storm\'s End]]\n*[[Bitterbridge]]\n*[[Myr]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[The Reach]]\n*[[Summer Isles]]\n*[[Red Keep]]\n*[[Casterly Rock]]\n*[[Mander]]\n*[[Winterfell]]\n*[[Dorne]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[House Tyrell]]\n*[[Kingsguard]]\n*[[Tourney of the Hand]]\n*[[Rainbow Guard]]\n*[[Sept]]\n*[[Maidenvault]]\n*[[House Baratheon]]\n*[[House Targaryen]]\n*[[House Stark]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[House Arryn]]\n*[[House Lannister]]\n*[[King of the Reach]]\n*[[Field of Fire]]\n*[[House Florent]]\n*[[Iron Throne]]\n*[[House Rowan]]\n*[[House Oakheart]]\n*\'\'[[The Bear and the Maiden Fair]]\'\'\n|}\n\n==References and Notes==\n* The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n*[http://slynt.blogspot.nl/2012/08/re-read-sansa-i-butterbumps-study-in.html Analyses and summary of the chapter] in the course of a 10th reread by Slynth.\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/10/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-4 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords part 4] Analyses and summary by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Storm of Swords: Chapter 06]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Sansa Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n\n[[es:Tormenta de Espadas-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 6]]\n[[fr:A Storm of Swords, Chapitre 07, Sansa]]\n[[zh:&amp;#20912;&amp;#38632;&amp;#30340;&amp;#39118;&amp;#26292;-&amp;#31456;&amp;#33410; 6]]</text>\n      <sha1>0km6l1ss5eogtnfxglyatczdvx1nzp8</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 70</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>4111</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>184248</id>\n      <parentid>182909</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-05-22T21:19:58Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Mindset</username>\n        <id>4579</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <minor/>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5387">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]]\n| title\t\t= Tyrion X\n| place         = [[King\'s Landing]]\n| page\t\t= 789\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 69|Jon IX]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 70|Tyrion X]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 71|Daenerys VI]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 66|Tyrion IX]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 77|Tyrion XI]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File: John_Picacio_Mountain_v_RedViper.jpg\xe2\x80\x8e |Ser [[Gregor Clegane]] vs [[Oberyn Martell]] \xe2\x80\x8e- \xc2\xa9 2012 John Picacio|thumb|300px|left]]\n[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] wakes up in the morning and readies himself to go to the trial.

Oberyn plans to fight with a spear and use only light armor. He specifically warns Tyrion not to touch the weapon.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tyene Sand]] later mentions that Oberyn poisened this spear. [[A Dance with Dragons]], [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 38|Chapter 38]], The Watcher (Areo I).&lt;/ref&gt;  He is full of confidence but Tyrion is not sure of his choice of weapon. Oberyn invites Tyrion to go to [[Dorne]] after the trial and talks about crowning [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]]. Then he changes the subject to the time he visited [[Lannisport]] with his mother and [[Elia Martell|sister]]. \n\nHis mother and [[Joanna Lannister|Tyrion\'s mother]] were friends and were planning on marrying [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] to Elia and/or Cersei to Oberyn. When they arrived at [[Casterly Rock]], Joanna had died and Tywin refused both suggestions and said that Cersei was intended for Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]]. Later Elia married prince Rhaegar. Oberyn thinks that this is why Tywin had Elia killed. &lt;ref&gt;In [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 53|Chapter 53]] of [[A Storm of Swords]], Tywin says to Tyrion that Elia was killed because he forgot to give instructions that she be spared.&lt;/ref&gt; Oberyn proclaims that today he will have justice for Elia and her children. \n\nThe combat is held in the outer ward. As soon as the fight begins, Oberyn starts to accuse Gregor of Elia\'s rape and murder. By using a spear as his weapon Oberyn has the advantage of being able to reach his enemy, and because he is only lightly armored he is fast enough to remain out of Gregor\'s reach. Oberyn manages to wound his enemy severely, disarming him and knocking him onto the ground. Before Oberyn can finish his opponent, Gregor grabs Oberyn by the leg and drags him down. With his bare hands Gregor smashes Oberyn\'s teeth, crushes his head, and kills him, all while admiting to the murder and rape of Elia and the murder of her children. Tyrion realizes that he is condemned when the [[Gold Cloaks]] take him to the [[black cells]].\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Podrick Payne]]\n*[[Addam Marbrand]]\n*[[Shae]]\n*[[Oberyn Martell]]\n*[[Oswell Kettleblack]]\n*[[Boros Blount]]\n*[[Meryn Trant]]\n*[[Cersei Lannister]]\n*[[Loras Tyrell]]\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Tywin Lannister]]\n*[[Mace Tyrell]]\n*[[Gregor Clegane]]\n*[[Kevan Lannister]]\n*[[Daemon Sand]]\n*[[Arron Qorgyle]]\n*[[Dagos Manwoody]]\n*[[Ellaria Sand]]\n*[[Osmund Kettleblack]]\n\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned\'\'\'\n*[[Dontos Hollard]]\n*[[Sansa Stark]]\n*[[Jeor Mormont]]\n*[[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n*[[Varys]]\n*[[Lollys Stokeworth]]\n*[[Sansa Stark]]\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned\'\'\'\n*[[Tommen Baratheon]]\n*[[Shagga]]\n*[[Timett]]\n*[[Doran Martell]]\n*[[Elia Martell]]\n*[[Myrcella Baratheon]]\n*[[Ilyn Payne]]\n*[[Symon Silver Tongue]]\n\n| style=&quot;width:25;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned\'\'\'\n*[[Mellario]]\n*[[Baelor Hightower]]\n*[[Leyton Hightower]]\n*[[Rhaegar Targaryen]]\n*[[Joanna Lannister]]\n*[[Rhaella Targaryen]]\n*[[Jaime Lannister]]\n*[[Bronn]]\n|}\n\n==References and notes==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/09/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-44 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Part 44].

Meera tells Bran that Jojen has the [[greensight]] and has dreams that sometimes come true. Jojen reveals that he has dreamed of the Winged Wolf chained to earth and a [[three-eyed crow]] has been unable to free him from the chains. Finally, Bran tells them something of his dreams, and Jojen keeps pressing. [[Summer (direwolf)|Summer]] gets aggressive and attacks as Bran gets angry, but the Reeds manage to climb a tree to avoid the wolf. Afterwards Bran asks Maester [[Luwin]] about Jojen\xe2\x80\x99s greensight, and is told no man has the greensight.\n==Synopsis==\n[[Meera Reed|Meera]], armed with a three pronged frog spear and a net, is facing [[Summer (direwolf)|Summer]] in the [[godswood]]. Summer charges past the spear, but is entangled in the net as he slams into her. [[Bran Stark|Bran]] tells her that she loses, but [[Jojen Reed|Jojen]], whom Old [[Nan]] calls \xe2\x80\x9clittle grandfather\xe2\x80\x9d because he is so somber, points out that Summer is entangled in the net. After disentangling the wolf, and Bran calling to him, she asks if Summer ever grows angry. Bran tells her not with him, and he has never drawn blood. Meera is still worried, but Bran assures her that he would not have drawn her blood; he knows and likes her. Bran thinks about how Meera is so like his sister [[Arya Stark|Arya]], and tells them that he wishes they were their wards instead of [[Walder Frey (son of Jammos)|Big Walder]] and [[Walder Frey (son of Merrett)|Little Walder]]. They have stayed after all the others have gone, and have become his constant companions. Bran tells Meera he has never heard of anyone fighting with a net, and asks if their master-at-arms taught her. She tells him her father taught her, and they have no knights or ravens at [[Greywater Watch]]; the island moves so neither ravens nor enemies can find it. When Bran asks if he would be welcome at Greywater Watch after the hostilities end, they assure him that [[Howland Reed|their lord father]] would welcome him anytime, and that leaving [[Winterfell]] sooner rather than later would be good for him.\n\nIt is revealed that the [[Ramsay Snow|Bastard of Bolton]] has forcibly taken Lady [[Donella Hornwood|Hornwood]] as his wife after the [[harvest feast]], that Lord [[Wyman Manderly|Manderly]] took her castle to protect it, and Ser [[Rodrik Cassel|Rodrik]] has gone east to settle the uprising and see that justice is done. Bran could ask Ser Rodrik about visiting the Reeds when he returns.\n\nMeera reveals that Jojen has the [[greensight]]; he has dreams of things that have not happened but sometimes do; Jojen corrects this by saying they always do. Bran asks to hear about the dreams, and is told that Jojen will, but only if Bran tells them about his own dreams. Bran denies he has dreams, saying that Maester [[Luwin]] gives him sleeping draughts, which he admits help only sometimes. Meera tells him that everyone in the Castle hears him scream when he sleeps. Bran does not tell, but is interested in what dreams Jojen has had. Jojen thinks that Bran is \'\'the Winged Wolf\'\' bound to earth by chains. He also states that a crow is trying to peck through the chains, but his beak can only chip them. When asked if the crow has 3 eyes, Jojen nods. \n\nThe crow first came to Jojen when he almost died of greywater fever, and to Bran after he fell. It told him he had to fly, but when Bran woke, he was broken and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t fly. After hearing this, Jojen is sure that Bran is the Winged Wolf, and they tell Bran that the [[three-eyed crow]] is not in Greywater Watch, but north, [[beyond the Wall]]. When their father heard Jojen\xe2\x80\x99s dream, he sent them to Winterfell. When Bran asks how he will break the chains he is told to open his eye, not the two that are opened, but the third one; when he opens his third eye he will be able to see south to the [[Summer Sea]] and north beyond the Wall.\n\nBran decides that he is tired of talking of crows, and wants to talk about something else, and then asks about [[lizard-lion]]s. However, Jojen keeps asking Bran about his dream, whether he has dreamed he was Summer, and then reveals that when he touched Summer the night of the harvest feast he felt Bran in Summer, and that he felt Bran fall. He then asks if falling scares Bran; Bran thinks of [[Jaime Lannister|the golden man]], and that he scares him. He has not been able to tell Ser Rodrik or Maester Luwin, so cannot tell the Reeds either. Jojen continues by asking if he falls every night, and there is a low rumbling growl from Summer. Meera puts herself between Summer and her brother and asks Bran to keep the wolf back. Bran claims that Jojen is making Summer angry, but Meera responds that it is him that Jojen is making angry, his fear. She tells Bran that he and Summer are part of each other. [[Shaggydog]] arrives. The direwolf lunges and Meera tells Bran to call them off, but he does not know how, and Jojen tells Bran that Summer is reacting to his anger. Meera tells her brother to climb the tree. Jojen responds that it is not his day to die, but complies, and Meera follows.\n\nBran has been unable to call off the wolves, but remembers he is not alone and calls to [[Hodor]]. When Hodor appears, Bran tells him to chase the wolves away, which he gleefully does. When Jojen returns to the ground he never takes his eyes off Summer as he tells Bran that they will talk again. Bran only thinks that it was the wolves, not him, and tells Hodor to bring him to Maester Luwin.\n\nWhen he is with Maester Luwin, he tells him that Meera said her brother has the Greensight. Luwin explains that their wise men call such people greenseers. He then tells Bran that nobody truly knows what it is, but that the [[First Men]] thought the greenseers could see through the eyes of the [[weirwood]], which is why the men cut down the trees, and that they have control over animals and fish. When asked, Bran tells the maester that Jojen only claims to have dreams that sometimes come true. The maester tells Bran that everyone has dreams that come true, like when he and Rickon dreamed their [[Eddard Stark|father]] was in the crypts before they knew he was dead. He then asks Bran whether he remembers the meaning of the metals of a maester\xe2\x80\x99s chain: black iron for ravenry, silver\xe2\x80\x94healing, gold\xe2\x80\x94sums. Luwin pulls his chain around his neck to reveal a link made of [[Valyrian steel]] and tells Bran that it signifies the study of the higher mysteries, magic; this is a study of small use that few maesters trouble with. He goes on to say that magic may have once been a mighty force but no longer: [[Valyria]] was its last ember, and dragons, the children, and giants are no more. Jojen does not have the greensight since no living man has that power.\n\nBran tells Meera what the maester said when she comes to him at dusk, and that Summer should not have tried to hurt Jojen, but Jojen should not have made the comments about his dreams; the crow lied, and so did Jojen that Bran could fly. Meera suggests that the maester may be wrong, but Bran replies that he is not and that his father depended on him. She leaves him with another of Jojen\xe2\x80\x99s dreams, that one day soon Maester Luwin will serve him a king\xe2\x80\x99s cut off the roast at a great feast, but the portion he gives to the Walders will be grey and dead, yet they will like their meal better than he.\n\nThat night Bran is almost afraid to sit at supper, but everyone is served the same, and there is nothing wrong with the food served the Walders. Bran is relieved: nothing bad is coming to Winterfell, but he is disappointed also\xe2\x80\x94so long as there is magic anything can happen. He will never walk, fly or be a knight.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://slynt.blogspot.com/2011/11/re-read-bran-iv-and-green-isnt-even.html Analyses and summary of the chapter in the course of a 10th reread] by Slynt.\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/03/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-13 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 28]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Bran Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Winterfell]]\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 28]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 29, Bran]]</text>\n      <sha1>5k6cz0qiytoth57h4lneb9v7ctl1zef</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Clash of Kings-Chapter 7</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6220</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166414</id>\n      <parentid>155668</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-23T20:45:33Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15555">{{Infobox Chapter ACfK\n| pov\t\t= [[Catelyn Tully]]\n| place         = [[Riverrun]]\n| title\t\t= Catelyn I\n| page\t\t= 79\n| previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 6|Jon I]]\n| current\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 7|Catelyn I]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 8|Tyrion II]]\n| arc previous\t=\n| arc next\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 22|Catelyn II]]\n}}\n\n[[Catelyn Stark]] watches as her son [[King in the North|King]] [[Robb Stark]] presents his peace terms to his envoy Ser [[Cleos Frey]]. Afterward, Catelyn argues with Robb over his refusal to exchange [[Jaime Lannister]] and his plan to send [[Theon Greyjoy]] back to the [[Iron Islands]]. Later, Catelyn discusses the war with [[Brynden Tully]] and they plan an alliance with King [[Renly Baratheon]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:Catelyn Stark.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Catelyn Stark n\xc3\xa9e Tully \xe2\x80\x94 by Amok \xc2\xa9]]\n\nAs they wait in [[Riverrun]]\xe2\x80\x99s Great Hall, [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] watches her son [[Robb Stark|Robb]] restlessly adjust his new-forged crown several times, and remarks to herself that a crown is not easy to wear, especially for a boy of fifteen years. \n\nThe ancient crown of the [[King in the North|Kings of Winter]] was lost three centuries ago when [[Torrhen Stark]] submitted to [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]], but the smiths have done well to match the descriptions: an open circlet of hammered bronze surmounted by nine black iron spikes in the shape of longswords. There is no gold, or silver, or gems; bronze and iron are the metals of winter, dark and strong.\n\nAs the guards bring in the captive, Robb lays his sword across his knees in the customary gesture of hostility. As Ser [[Cleos Frey]] is forced to his knees, Catelyn reflects that he does not look like a [[House Lannister|Lannister]]. Although his mother Lady [[Genna Lannister|Genna]] is sister to Lord [[Tywin Lannister]], Ser Cleos has inherited the stringy brown locks, weak chin, and thin face of his father, Ser [[Emmon Frey]].\n\nRobb\xe2\x80\x99s sword glimmers faintly as he bids Ser Cleos to rise, but it is [[Grey Wind]] who frightens the knight. As big as any elkhound, Robb\xe2\x80\x99s [[direwolf]] sniffs at Ser Cleos, who was captured in the [[Battle of the Whispering Wood|Whispering Wood]] where Grey Wind killed half a dozen men. Ser Cleos scrambles to his feet and away from the direwolf so quickly that it provokes laughter from the audience. Ser Cleos thanks Robb, calling him \xe2\x80\x9cmy lord,\xe2\x80\x9d but [[Greatjon Umber]] corrects that a king is styled \xe2\x80\x9cYour Grace.\xe2\x80\x9d Ser Cleos accepts the correction, and Catelyn notes that he truly is more [[House Frey|Frey]] than Lannister; they would never have gotten such an honorific out of [[Jaime Lannister]].\n\nRobb wishes Ser Cleos to be his envoy to Queen [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] in [[King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing]]. Robb reminds Ser Cleos that he considers him a Lannister, not a Frey, since he sided with the Lannisters in the Whispering Wood. He therefore expects Ser Cleos to return with the queen\xe2\x80\x99s reply and resume his captivity. Ser Cleos vows on his [[knighthood]] to do so, and asks what the message is. Robb offers to make peace if his if his terms are met. At the back of the hall, Lord [[Rickard Karstark]] shoves through a rank of guards and out the door, but Robb pays no attention. Exchanging his sword for a parchment, Robb reads his terms:\n\n[[File:Robb stark by riavel.jpg|thumb|240px|right|King Robb Stark \xe2\x80\x93 by Riavel \xc2\xa9]]\n\n{{Quote|First, the queen must release my sisters and provide them with transport by sea from King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing to [[White Harbor]]. It is to be understood that [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]]\xe2\x80\x99s betrothal to [[Joffrey Baratheon]] is at an end. When I receive word from my [[castellan]] that my sisters have returned unharmed to [[Winterfell]], I will release the queen\xe2\x80\x99s cousins, the squire [[Willem Lannister]] and your brother [[Tion Frey]], and give them safe escort to [[Casterly Rock]] or wheresoever she desires them delivered.}} \n{{Quote|Secondly, my [[Eddard Stark|lord father]]\xe2\x80\x99s bones will be returned to us, so he may rest beside his [[Brandon Stark|brother]] and [[Lyanna Stark|sister]] in the crypts beneath Winterfell, as he would have wished. The remains of the men of his household guard who died in his service at King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing must also be returned.}}\n{{Quote|Third, my father\xe2\x80\x99s greatsword [[Ice]] will be delivered to my hand, here at Riverrun.}}\n{{Quote|Fourth, the queen will command her father Lord Tywin to release those knights and lords bannermen of mine that he took captive in the [[Battle of the Green Fork|battle on the Green Fork]] of the [[Trident]]. Once he does so, I shall release my own captives taken in the Whispering Wood and the [[Battle of the Camps]], save Jaime Lannister alone, who will remain my hostage for his father\xe2\x80\x99s good behavior.}}\n{{Quote|Lastly, King Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claims to dominion over [[the north]]. Henceforth we are no part of their realm, but a free and independent kingdom, as of old. Our domain shall include all the [[House Stark|Stark]] lands north of [[the Neck]], and in addition the lands watered by the River Trident and its vassal streams, bounded by the [[Golden Tooth]] to the west and the [[Mountains of the Moon]] in the east.}}\n\nAfter a cheer from the Greatjon, Robb states he will provide a map of the new borders. He declares that Lord Tywin must cease his raids and withdraw, King Joffrey must rescind all claims to Robb\xe2\x80\x99s lands and subjects, and the Lannisters must deliver ten highborn hostages as a pledge of peace. Robb promises to release two hostages every year so long as the pact is honored, but if it is not he will give Queen Cersei another Whispering Wood. To emphasize his point, Robb whistles and Grey Wind comes forward and snarls. The Greatjon raises another cheer and Grey Wind howls. When Ser Cleos agrees, Robb orders him to depart with Ser [[Robin Ryger]] at first light and dismisses the assembly.\n\nOut in the gallery, Catelyn compliments her son\xe2\x80\x99s performance, but notes that the theatrics with Grey Wind befit a boy more than a king. Robb only smiles and asks if she saw Ser Cleos\xe2\x80\x99 face. Catelyn replies that what she saw was Rickard Karstark storming out. Robb admits he saw it as well. Catelyn\xe2\x80\x99s brother [[Edmure Tully]] comments that others may agree with Lord Rickard, and asks how they can talk of peace while the Lannisters are still pillaging the [[Riverlands]]. He urges Robb to march on Lord Tywin at [[Harrenhal]], but Robb insists he does not have the strength. Edmure points out that they only grow weaker sitting here.\n\nCatelyn snaps that it was Edmure\xe2\x80\x99s idea to permit the river lords to depart for their own lands. Edmure argues that he cannot command his lords to remain idle while their crops are burnt and their people killed, but it would be an ill thing if a northman like Lord Rickard left them. Robb agrees to speak with Lord Rickard, but he cannot blame the man for loathing peace with [[Torrhen Karstark|his]] [[Eddard Karstark|sons]]\xe2\x80\x99 killers. Catelyn points out that more bloodshed will not bring back the dead. She suggests a wiser man might have offered sweeter terms, but Robb declares that sweeter terms would have gagged him. Catelyn realizes that her son wants vengeance as much as Lord Rickard.\n\n[[File:Riverrun by Feliche.jpg|thumb|350px|left|Riverrun \xe2\x80\x94 by Feliche \xc2\xa9]]\n\nCatelyn points out that Cersei will never trade Sansa and [[Arya Stark|Arya]] for a pair of cousins when what she wants is her brother Jaime. Robb explains that his bannermen will never allow him to release the Kingslayer, even if he wanted to. Catelyn says the lords made Robb their king, but Robb replies that they can unmake him just as easy. Catelyn argues that the safe return of the girls is worth Robb\xe2\x80\x99s crown, fearing for her daughters if something bad should befall Jaime in their custody. Robb assures her that no one sees Jaime without his warrant. \n\nCatelyn asks if Robb is afraid to face Jaime in the field again. Edmure sides with Robb, but accidentally refers to him as &quot;the boy.&quot; Robb roars at Edmure not to call him a boy and declares he can defeat Jaime again if he must. He admits he would have traded Jaime for his father, but looks hurt when Catelyn presses him to say whether the girls are important enough. Catelyn realizes that Robb is doing his best, yet she cannot bear the thought of losing her daughters as well as her husband. Robb promises that if Cersei refuses peace he will do all he can for his sisters by making her rue the decision. \n\nCatelyn can sense Robb is tired of the subject. He asks her to go to [[the Twins]] to meet Lord [[Walder Frey]]\xe2\x80\x99s daughters and help choose his future bride. Catelyn sees this as an excuse to send her away for saying things Robb does not want to hear, so she tells Robb he is old enough to choose for himself. Next, Robb urges her to accompany [[Theon Greyjoy]] and the [[House Mallister|Mallisters]] to [[Seagard]], and return by ship to Winterfell to be with [[Bran Stark|Bran]] and [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]]. Catelyn insists that until her father dies her place is at Riverrun. \n\nRobb mentions that he could command her to go, but Catelyn counters by asking Robb to reconsider sending Theon as his envoy to [[Pyke]]. Robb asks who would be better to negotiate with Lord [[Balon Greyjoy]] than his son. Catelyn insists that \'\'anyone\'\' would be better. Robb argues that Theon fought bravely for them and they have need of his father\xe2\x80\x99s longships. Catelyn replies that they will get the ships sooner if Theon remains a hostage. She also insists Balon is not trustworthy and may aspire to wear a crown [[Greyjoy Rebellion|again]] himself. Robb declares he will gladly give Balon a crown if it helps defeat the Lannisters. Before Catelyn can reply, Robb walks off and Catelyn can only watch him go, remembering back at [[Moat Cailin]] when she urged him to command as he does now.\n\nCatelyn asks Edmure to join her in father\xe2\x80\x99s sickroom, but he begs off to speak with some new recruits. On her way to the central keep, Catelyn shortcuts through the [[godswood]], where the leaves still rustle on the trees, ignorant of the [[white raven]] that has proclaimed the arrival of autumn. Catelyn is thankful that the weather is holding, since autumn is a fearful time when even the wisest never know if the next harvest will be the last.\n\nShe finds Lord [[Hoster Tully]] sleeping in his solar, made frail by the death growing within him. Beside the bed sits her uncle, Ser [[Brynden Tully|Bynden the Blackfish]]. When Catelyn asks if Robb knows of his return, the Blackfish says he did not interrupt the court because Robb will want to hear his news in private first. When her uncle asks about her father, Catelyn confesses that he grows weaker every day, and sometimes his mind is unclear. The Blackfish admits that he always wonders if his brother will be dead upon his return. Catelyn comforts him that at least he made his peace with her father.\n\n[[File:Bryn-winterfell.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Ser Brynden \xe2\x80\x9cBlackfish\xe2\x80\x9d Tully - by M.Luisa Giliberti \xc2\xa9]]\n\nThey sit silently for a long time before Catelyn asks for the Blackfish\xe2\x80\x99s tidings. To avoid waking her father, they adjourn to the balcony. Her uncle comments that the [[red comet]] is now visible by day, and says his men call it the \xe2\x80\x9cRed Messenger,\xe2\x80\x9d though he wonders what the message is. Catelyn says the Greatjon claims it is a red flag of vengeance for her husband, while Edmure claims it is a victory omen: a fish in [[House Tully|Tully]] colors, red against blue. Catelyn only sees the crimson of House Lannister, but her uncle points out that the comet is neither Lannister crimson nor Tully red, but a smear of blood across the sky. Catelyn asks whose blood, but the Blackfish asks if there was ever a war where only one side bled.\n\nThe Blackfish explains that the war has spread south to the [[Blackwater Rush]] and north nearly to the Twins. [[Marq Piper]] and [[Karyl Vance]] have won small victories, and [[Beric Dondarrion]] is harassing Lord Tywin\xe2\x80\x99s raiders and foragers. Ser [[Burton Crakehall]] boasted of killing Dondarrion until Dondarrion killed him in an ambush. Catelyn remembers that some of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s household guard rode with Dondarrion from King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing and blesses their actions. \n\nThe Blackfish comments that Dondarrion and [[Thoros of Myr]] are clever enough to play hit and run, but Robb should never have permitted the river lords return to their own lands. [[Jonos Bracken]] was wounded and lost his heir [[Hendry Bracken|Hendry]] reclaiming [[Stone Hedge]], [[Tytos Blackwood]] is left with only [[Raventree Hall]], and young [[Lyman Darry]] was killed by [[Gregor Clegane]] less than a fortnight after reclaiming [[Castle Darry]]. The Blackfish declares that Clegane\xe2\x80\x99s head would make a noble gift for all the people of the realm.\n\nTalk of heads reminds Catelyn that her husband\xe2\x80\x99s remains mounted on spike above the [[Red Keep]]. She reminds her uncle that Gregor Clegane is only a servant of Lord Tywin, whom Catelyn believes is the true danger. The Blackfish agrees, noting Tywin\xe2\x80\x99s wisdom in sitting safe in Harrenhal and living off their harvests and burning what he does not take. In addition to Clegane, Ser [[Amory Lorch]] and a [[Qohor]]ik [[Vargo Hoat|sellsword]] are also abroad, raping, burning, and butchering. Catelyn knows Edmure will rage at the news. She also admits Robb is restless and may listen if Edmure and the Greatjon will urge him to march on Harrenhal. The Blackfish declares that is exactly what Lord Tywin wishes, and the first rule of war is to never give the enemy his wish.\n\nCatelyn recalls the tales of the vast fortress of Harrenhal by the waters of the [[Gods Eye]]. King [[Harren Hoare|Harren the Black]] beggared the Riverlands and the [[Iron Islands]] alike to realize his dream of the highest hall and tallest towers in [[Westeros]], but thick walls and high towers proved small use against Aegon the Conqueror\xe2\x80\x99s [[dragon]]s. Harren and all his line perished in the fires that engulfed the fortress. Strong the castle might be, but also cursed, for every House that has held Harrenhal since has come to misfortune.\n\nCatelyn decides they must dissuade Robb from fighting at Harrenhal. Her uncle then tells her the worst part: Ser [[Stafford Lannister]] is gathering a new host at Casterly Rock, though it will be made of sellswords and new recruits who require training. However, Lord Tywin is in no hurry and will wait patiently for his reinforcements. Then Catelyn gets an idea: if they confront Lord Tywin with a new threat he might be forced leave Harrenhal. Her uncle names Lord Renly, but Catelyn insist that they must call him \'\'King\'\' Renly if they are to ask his help. The Blackfish smiles, but points out that Renly will want something in return. Catelyn replies that he will want what kings always want: homage.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n* [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2011/05/re-read-catelyn-i.html Review of the chapter] in the course of a tenth reread by Slynt. \n*[http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2010/02/jon-catelyn.html Humorous review and summary of the chapter] by Jason.\xc2\xa0\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/01/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-4 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 07]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Catelyn Tully]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Riverrun]]\n\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 08, Catelyn]]</text>\n      <sha1>2ukh7jv697y5nw8u5ss7tnohegc8kyk</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Feast for Crows-Chapter 17</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5725</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166947</id>\n      <parentid>159763</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-06-05T19:12:35Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7213">{{Infobox Chapter AFfC\n| pov\t\t= [[Cersei Lannister]]\n| title\t\t= Cersei IV\n| place         = [[King\'s Landing]]\n| page\t\t= 238\n| previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 16|Jaime II]]\n| current\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 17|Cersei IV]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 18|The Iron Captain]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 12|Cersei III]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 24|Cersei V]]\n}}\n \n==Synopsis== \nAfter yet another group presents her with a [[pious dwarf|dwarf\'s head]] that is not [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion\'s]], [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] walks together with [[Qyburn]] to meet the small council. The new [[Master of Whisperers]] indicates that he has prepared the &quot;skull&quot; in an ebony box for delivery to Prince [[Doran Martell|Doran]], but no mention is made that it belongs to [[Gregor Clegane]]. \n\n[[Pycelle]] is near apoplectic upon hearing that Qyburn has been raised to Lord and has replaced [[Varys]] on the council, and Cersei makes it clear how unfit she considers the old Grand Maester. Cersei has finalised her appointments, placing men she considers to be meek and loyal and giving them the titles used in the [[Free Cities]], thinking that she will have no &quot;masters&quot; with her in the [[small Council]]. She now has a council consisting of:\n*[[Orton Merryweather]] as judiciar ([[master of laws]]) \n*[[Aurane Waters]] as grand admiral ([[master of ships]])\n*Her uncle [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]]\'s father-in-law Ser [[Harys Swyft]] as &quot;her&quot; [[Hand of the King|Hand]]. This last appointment she considers as a shield against any threat that Ser Kevan may present.\n\nThe council first discusses the unrest in [[Sunspear]] and Prince Doran\'s letter that he imprisoned the [[Sand Snakes]]. Cersei notes that they are sending [[Balon Swann]] to Dorne with [[Gregor Clegane]]\'s head as has been promised, but she does not mention that Balon will have another task as well.&lt;ref&gt; We next learn of Ser [[Balon Swann]]\'s mission in Dorne in [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 40|Chapter 40]]&lt;/ref&gt; \n\nWe also learn that [[High Septon (Tyrion\'s)|Tyrion\'s High Septon]] has died in his &quot;sleep&quot;, and the council brings up the continuing influx of &quot;sparrows&quot; into [[King\'s Landing]], stirring up the populace with their preaching of &quot;doom and demon worship&quot;. But Cersei cares not, nor does she care who becomes [[High Septon]], provided he &quot;pronounce(s) an anathema upon the Imp.&quot; \n\nThe next topic is a letter by the [[Lords Declarant]] in [[the Vale]] of Arryn, but the Queen Regent decides not to intervene directly on [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]]\'s behalf, but only send a letter warning these Lords that no harm must come to Lord Petyr.\n\nWhen the subject of rebuilding the fleet comes up, Cersei is adamant against making any pact with the [[ironborn]], stating, &quot;Their turn will come, once we have dealt with [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]].&quot; Aurane Waters will get his fleet of dromonds however, and Cersei will find the coin by deferring the crown\'s debt to the [[Faith of the Seven]] and to the [[Iron Bank of Braavos]] until the end of the [[War of the Five Kings|war]]. Pycelle warns her against this route, cautioning that it would be foolish to make an enemy of the Iron Bank, but the decision is made regardless. &lt;ref&gt; This decision influences the events of [[A Dance with Dragons]], [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 44|Chapter 44]]&lt;/ref&gt; \n\nThe council also discusses the prudence of making someone pay for the [[Red Wedding]] so as to appease all the &quot;sparrows&quot;; and in the mean time offering whomever succeeds the sure-to-die-soon Lord [[Walder Frey]] a chance to rid himself of unwanted brothers, half-brothers and nephews.\n\nOn the topic of the [[North]], the council indicates that Stannis may soon be confronted by [[Roose Bolton]]\'s army, once [[Ramsay Snow|his bastard son]] hits [[Moat Cailin]] from the north, allowing the Lord of the [[Dreadfort]] passage through [[the Neck]]. Cersei mentions that [[Wyman Manderly]] has taken [[Davos Seaworth]] captive, after the latter was sent by Stannis to treat with him.{{Ref|aDwD|9}}{{Ref|aDwD|15}}{{Ref|aDwD|19}} Lord Manderly seeks the favor of the [[Iron Throne]], and the queen will recommend that he can achieve that favor if he beheads Stannis\'s Hand.&lt;ref&gt;Pages 277-278 (UK MMP edition; \'\'circa\'\' page 246 in the US and UK Hardcover Editions); we learn Lord Manderly\'s reaction to this ultimatum in [[A Dance with Dragons]], [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 29|Chapter 29]] from Manderly\'s perspective, and in [[A Feast for Crows]], [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 24|Chapter 24 (Cersei V)]], \'\'circa\'\' page 346 from Cersei\'s perspective&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] is mentioned, Cersei shocks the council into silence with a violent tirade about how she plans to deal with the girl once she is found. In the uneasy silence that follows, Cersei also remarks that Lord Bolton possesses [[Arya Stark]] and that her marriage to his bastard should appease the north, keeping to herself the fact that &quot;Arya Stark&quot; is really a &quot;[[Jeyne Poole|steward\'s whelp]]&quot; provided by Littlefinger. \n\nNext they debate the fact that the [[Night\'s Watch]] might be joining its might to Stannis, especially now that [[Jon Snow]] is their Lord Commander. The council decides to warn the Watch that the crown will stop sending men to the Wall, but Qyburn suggests that they do send 100 men. Cersei picks up on this, with the idea that the men sent will really be assassins ordered to remove [[Eddard Stark]]\'s bastard. \n\nBack in her apartments, Cersei learns from [[Taena of Myr|Taena]] that [[Dorcas]] fancies [[Osney Kettleblack]], and also hints that she herself likes dangerous, scarred men. Cersei tries to learn the name of Taena\'s old flame, but the [[Myr]]ish woman is evasive. \n\nWhen Osney arrives, Cersei butters him up with an offer to join the [[Kingsguard]] and a chance to bed her again, provided he accomplishes a couple of tasks. First, Cersei wants him to seduce, and hopefully bed, Queen [[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]]; this will enable Cersei to execute her lawfully. Second, she plans to send him to the [[Wall]] as &quot;punishment&quot; for his treason with Margaery, but in reality he will lead a group of men to assassinate [[Jon Snow]]. She assures him that the men would not be required to serve in the Watch after they complete their task, and promises him a lordship, should he accomplish both missions. \n\nLater that night, Cersei asks Lady Taena to remark to Margaery that she has a secret admirer, but not to let out Ser Osney\'s name unless the girl probes.\n\n==References and Notes== \n{{References}}\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/04/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-feast-for-crows-part-12 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Feast for Crows, Part 12].

Tyrion wants to make a fire, but Bronn protests that it will bring the [[Vale mountain clans]] down on them. Tyrion sees no point in trying to avoid the clans and Bronn gives in. As Tyrion plans, the [[Stone Crows]] arrive and Tyrion negotiates an agreement. \n\n==Synopsis==    \n[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] and [[Bronn]] have taken shelter beneath some aspens just off the [[high road]]. Tyrion is gathering wood and asks Bronn if a particular branch will do for a fire. Bronn asks if he has a death wish, as a fire will bring the [[Vale mountain clans]] down on them. Bronn thinks it is best to travel fast at night, avoid the road, and make no noise or fires. Tyrion states that traveling fast at night is a good way to fall down the mountain and that the clans will find them no matter what they do. Bronn replies that that means they are dead men. Tyrion insists that he would prefer to die comfortable and asks if Bronn can find some game; he does not look forward to the salt beef and hard bread that [[Lysa Arryn]] had provided them. \n\nBronn threatens to take Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s horse and leave, asking what Tyrion would do. Tyrion replies that he would probably die. When Bronn asks if Tyrion believes his threat, Tyrion admits he does, commenting that Bronn was quick to finish off [[Chiggen]] when he took an arrow in the belly. Bronn points out that Chiggen was as good as dead anyway and would have done the same for him.\n\nBronn explains that although he fought for Tyrion he is not his friend and not his servant. Tyrion accepts this with good humor, stating that he is mainly interested in Bronn\xe2\x80\x99s sword, not his friendship. When Bronn asks how Tyrion knew he would be his champion, Tyrion explains that he did not know, but anticipated Bronn\xe2\x80\x99s [[sellsword]] nature: go for the gold. Bronn helped take Tyrion captive in hopes of a reward, but the [[House Stark|Starks]] are too proud to take lowborn scum like Bronn into their service permanently, so Tyrion had gambled that Bronn would abandon Lady [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] for the next hopeful venture: rescuing him.\n\nBronn tells Tyrion that he has a bold tongue and that someday somebody will cut it out and make him eat it. Tyrion replies that everyone tells him that. Tyrion then declares that although Bronn is scum, he is not stupid and knows where his best interest lie, luckily for Tyrion. When Bronn quickly lights the fire with flint, Tyrion compliments that Bronn is also useful and almost as good with a sword as his brother [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]].\n\nThen Tyrion asks what Bronn wants: gold, land, or women. He promises that if Bronn keeps him alive he will have it. Bronn asks about what happens if Tyrion dies. Tyrion quips that then he will have one sincere mourner. Bronn then informs Tyrion that his is no man\xe2\x80\x99s toady. Tyrion replies that he is sure Bronn is no man\xe2\x80\x99s friend, adding that he is sure Bronn will betray him just like Lady Stark if there is a profit. However, Tyrion begs Bronn to remember that he will match any price offered to betray him because he likes living. Bronn disappears to go hunting at Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s request.\n\nAn hour later they are eating a goat they have roasted. Tyrion complains about the meat\xe2\x80\x99s toughness, but says he will not complain too loudly since at the [[Eyrie]] he would have to dance on a precipice for a boiled bean. Bronn then complains that Tyrion gave the [[Mord|turnkey]] a purse of gold and Tyrion states that a Lannister always pays his debts. He kept his silver, however. After giving the turnkey the purse, Tyrion told him that if he ever tired of Lady Arryn\xe2\x80\x99s service, he need only come to [[Casterly Rock]] to get the rest. Bronn asks what Tyrion plans when they reach the river and Tyrion states a whore, a feather bed, and wine for a start and then on to Casterly Rock or King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing since he has questions about a dagger. Bronn seems surprised that Tyrion is truly innocent.\n\n[[File:Tysha Lannister1.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Tyrion Lannister\xe2\x80\x99s wife, Tysha \xe2\x80\x93 by jekaa\xc2\xa9]]\n\nAs they settle down for the night, Tyrion notes that the clansmen are taking their time. Bronn replies that he would fear a trap with them being so open. Tyrion suggests they sing to scare them away. As Tyrion whistles a song, he asks Bronn if he has ever heard it before. Bronn states he has heard it in inns and whorehouses. Tyrion goes on to say the [[Tysha|first girl]] he bedded used to sing it. He tells Bronn the story of when he and his brother [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] rescued her. They heard a scream and Tysha came running onto the road chased by two men. Jaime went after the men while Tyrion dismounted to protect the girl. He tells Bronn that she was about a year older than him, low born, half-starved, and unwashed. When Jaime left to get help from [[Casterly Rock]], Tyrion took her to an inn where they shared a meal and talked. The wine went to 13-year old Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s head and he found himself in bed with her. When he broke her maidenhead she wept and then kissed him. He found a drunken [[Faith of the Seven|septon]] to marry them and set her up a cottage of her own where they played man and wife for a fortnight. Then the septon sobered and told [[Tywin Lannister|Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s father]], and that was the end of his marriage. Jaime was forced to confess that the girl was a whore and that he set the whole thing up. Then Lord Tywin gave her to a barracks of guardsmen and paid her a silver for each one. Tywin made Tyrion go last, having him pay her a gold coin since he was a Lannister.\n\nBronn states that he would have killed the man who did that to him and Tyrion states that he might yet; a Lannister always pays his debts. Tyrion rolls into his [[shadowcat|shadowskin]] cloak to sleep, and dreams of the [[sky cells|sky cells]] but this time he is the jailor, driving his father back to the abyss.\n\n[[File:Shagga.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Shagga son of Dolf \xe2\x80\x93 by Thaldir\xc2\xa9]] \n\nBronn wakes him with a warning and Tyrion motions for Bronn to stay still. Then Tyrion calls out for the clansmen to join them and share their goat. A voice replies that, since this is their mountain, it is their goat. Tyrion agrees that it is and asks their names. They declare themselves [[Stone Crows]] and a big man named [[Shagga]] armed with two axes steps into the light first. Slowly the rest emerge, armed with a variety of weapons including pitchforks.\n\nTyrion introduces himself and declares himself a member of \xe2\x80\x9cClan Lannister.\xe2\x80\x9d He offers to pay the clansmen for the goat they ate. [[Gunthor son of Gurn]], who seems to be their chief, asks what he has to give them, and Tyrion tells them he has silver in his purse, and his weapons and armor. [[Conn]] replies that Tyrion is going to pay them with their own coin; they can take what they want from their corpses. Gunthor states they have nothing to give but their lives and asks Tyrion how he would like to die. Tyrion replies, \xe2\x80\x9cIn my own bed, with a belly full of wine and a maiden\xe2\x80\x99s mouth around my cock, at the age of eighty.\xe2\x80\x9d Shagga laughs but the others seem unamused.\n\nGunthor tells Conn to kill Bronn and take Tyrion to milk goats and make the mothers laugh. Bronn springs to his feet, asking who dies first, but Tyrion screams for him to stop. Tyrion asks the clansmen if their weapons are the best they could steal, declaring them good for killing sheep at most. He adds that his father\xe2\x80\x99s smiths shit better weapons. Gunthor, thinking of the starving women and children of his tribe, is interested and asks what Tyrion will give them for their lives. In addition to the list of weapons suggested by the tribesmen, Tyrion offers them the [[Vale of Arryn]].\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/08/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-21 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/043/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==    \n[[Category:A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 42]]\n[[Category:A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Tyrion Lannister]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place on the High Road]]\n\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 43, Tyrion]]\n[[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\xa2\xd0\xb8\xd1\x80\xd0\xb8\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbd VI]]</text>\n      <sha1>ifsvxih7arcxdkbuiby2900lbexo8fp</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Game of Thrones-Chapter 5</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>3394</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>117018</id>\n      <parentid>107214</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2014-01-10T16:53:23Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Dustyham1991</username>\n        <id>5594</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <minor/>\n      <comment>/* Synopsis */ Added image</comment>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5598">{{Infobox Chapter AGoT\n| pov\t\t= [[Jon Snow]]\n| place         = [[Winterfell]]\n| title\t\t= Jon I\n| page\t\t= \n| previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 4|Eddard I]]\n| current\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 5|Jon I]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 6|Catelyn II]]\n| arc previous\t= \n| arc next\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 10|Jon II]]\n}} __NOTOC__\n\n[[Jon Snow]] attends the feast Winterfell is holding for the royal guests and speaks with both [[Benjen Stark]] and [[Tyrion Lannister]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n\nA feast is held in [[Winterfell]] in honor of King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]]\'s royal visit. Jon decides he is thankful his bastardy has relegated him to the far end of the hall with the younger squires instead of the king\'s family. Here he can drink as much as he wants (he has a man\xe2\x80\x99s thirst) and mingle freely with those around him. \n\nJon watches the king and his family as they arrive. He recognizes Queen [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]]\'s false smile and is disappointed with fat, red-faced King Robert. The 8-year-old Princess [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]] seems smitten with her escort [[Robb Stark|Robb]], leading Jon to decide she is insipid. [[Arya Stark|Arya]] is escorted by plump, young Prince [[Tommen]]. The 12-year-old Crown Prince [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] (who is even taller than Robb) is escorting the radiant [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]]. Jon decides he does not like Joffrey\xe2\x80\x99s pouty lips or the disdain the prince seems to hold for Winterfell. He also notes that the queen\'s brother [[Jaime Lannister]] looks like a proper king, and that waddling dwarf [[Tyrion Lannister]] is grotesquely fascinating, as ugly as Jaime and Cersei are beautiful. The last to enter are [[Benjen Stark]] and [[Theon Greyjoy]].\n\n[[File:Sardag jon snow.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Jon Snow, the Snow of Winterfell]]\n\nJon feeds his [[direwolf]] [[Ghost]] under the table and watches the pup silently face down a full-grown dog three times his size. Bringing his wolf to the feast is another perk to being the bastard. Jon is soon joined by his uncle Benjen, who asks Jon how much he\'s had to drink, adding that Jon is older than he was when he first got truly drunk. Benjen asks about Ghost and Jon explains that he named him Ghost for his white color and because he never makes a sound. Benjen then asks why Jon is not at the main table and Jon says flatly that Lady [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] thought seating a bastard with the king might give offense.\n\nBenjen comments that [[Eddard Stark|Eddard]] does not seem festive and Jon adds that neither does the queen, probably because of King Robert\'s visit to the crypts. Benjen commends Jon\'s keen observation and remarks that he could use a man like him on [[the Wall]]. Jon asks if he can return to the Wall with Benjen. Benjen replies that the Wall is a hard place for a boy, but Jon counters that he will turn 15 on his next name day and it\'s said bastards grow up faster than purebloods. Jon thinks about how all his half brothers and sisters have futures, but there is no future for a bastard. Benjen says that he should know a woman and father a bastard or two first, to know what he will be giving up. This angers Jon, who states that he will \'\'never\'\' father a bastard and runs off with Ghost at his heels before anyone can see him cry.\n\nAs Jon is leaving, Tyrion Lannister speaks to him from a ledge in the deserted yard and asks if he can take a look at Ghost. Jon offers to help him down, but Tyrion jumps down, acrobatically landing on his hands and vaulting to his feet. Ghost is uncertain about Tyrion, but submits to examination at Jon\'s command. Tyrion asks if Jon is Eddard\'s bastard. Jon bridles and Tyrion apologizes that as a dwarf he can usually speak as he pleases, like a jester. He comments that Jon seems to have more of [[the North]] in him than his half-siblings. Tyrion advises Jon never to forget who and what he is so that no one can use it against him. When Jon questions what Tyrion would know about being a bastard, Tyrion replies that all dwarfs are bastards in their father\xe2\x80\x99s eyes and that, although all dwarfs are bastards, not all bastards need to be dwarfs.\n\n==Character List Appearing/Mentioned==\n{{Columns|4| \n*[[Arya Stark]]\n*[[Benjen Stark]]\n*[[Catelyn Tully]]\n*[[Cersei Lannister]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n*[[Ghost]]\n\n*[[Jaime Lannister]]\n*[[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n*[[Jon Snow]]\n*[[Myrcella Baratheon]]\n*[[Rickon Stark]]\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n*[[Sansa Stark]]\n*[[Theon Greyjoy]]\n*[[Tommen Baratheon]]\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]]\n\n*[[Daeron I Targaryen]]\n*[[Hullen]]\n*[[Luwin|Maester Luwin]]\n*[[Tywin Lannister]]\n}}\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|4| \n*[[Casterly Rock]]\n*[[Dorne]]\n*[[Trident]]\n*[[Winterfell]]\n\n*[[House Baratheon]]\n*[[House Greyjoy]]\n*[[Holdfast]]\n\n*[[Kingslayer]]\n*[[House Lannister]]\n*[[Night\'s Watch]]\n\n*[[House Stark]]\n*[[House Targaryen]]\n*[[Daeron I Targaryen|Young Dragon]]\n}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2009/05/eddard-jon.html Humorous review of the chapter]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/04/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-3 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/006/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 05]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Jon Snow|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 05]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Winterfell]]\n\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 06, Jon]][[pt:A Guerra dos Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 5]][[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\x94\xd0\xb6\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbd I]]</text>\n      <sha1>jo1jsmzdxgdduil0l94mosnqpdi8rfu</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Clash of Kings-Chapter 14</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6205</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166417</id>\n      <parentid>134518</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-23T20:46:52Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14289">{{Infobox Chapter ACfK\n| pov\t\t= [[Arya Stark]]\n| place         = [[Gods Eye river|River]] and [[Gods Eye town|town]] south of the [[Gods Eye]]\n| title\t\t= Arya IV\n| page\t\t= 156\n| previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 13|Jon II]]\n| current\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 14|Arya IV]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 15|Tyrion III]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 9|Arya III]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 19|Arya V]]\n}}\n\n[[Arya Stark|Arya]] and the others decide to spend the night in the holdfast of an [[Gods Eye town|abandoned town]] on the southern shores of the [[Gods Eye]]. That night, [[House Lannister|Lannister]] raiders led by Ser [[Amory Lorch]] arrive to demand they open the gate. When [[Yoren]] refuses, a fight breaks out. As the battle turns against them, Yoren orders Arya to get the survivors out through an escape tunnel in the burning barn. Before escaping Arya throws an axe to the three criminals trapped in their wagon.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Gods Eye river|The river]] seems a peaceful place to [[Arya Stark|Arya]] until [[Koss]] finds a soldier decomposing in the reeds. [[Yoren]] sends [[Dobber]] to search the body for valuables and, finding they cannot cross, he takes Koss upriver and sends [[Woth]] and [[Gerren]] downriver to look for a ford. While they wait, [[Lommy]] and [[Tarber]] go wading and throw mud at [[Hot Pie]] while Arya watches [[Kurz]] catch a fish with his hands, thinking it must be easier than catching cats.\n\nThe scouts return at midday to report only a burnt bridge. Drawing a map in the mud, Yoren explains that the river flows south from the [[Gods Eye]]. With no way to cross the river without abandoning the wagons, they cannot pass along the lake\'s western shore as planned, and going east will bring them back to the [[kingsroad]]. Yoren decides to go north to where the river meets the lake, sell all they have to hire a boat in [[Gods Eye town|the town]] there, and sail across the lake to [[Harrentown]]. There they can buy new mounts or take refuge at [[Harrenhal]], the seat of Lady [[Shella Whent]], a known friend of the [[Night\'s Watch]].\n\nHot Pie worries about ghosts at Harrenhal, but Yoren only spits. Arya recalls [[Nan|Old Nan]]\'s stories about Evil King [[Harren Hoare|Harren]] and how [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon]] unleashed his [[dragons]] to turn the castle into a pyre. Old Nan told that fiery spirits still haunt the castle and sometimes men who sleep there are found burnt alive in the morning, but Arya does not believe the stories. It will be knights at Harrenhal, not ghosts, and she can reveal herself to Lady Whent and maybe be escorted home.\n\nThey pass abandoned cottages and untended fields to find the town deserted as well, which frightens Arya when she wonders what scared the people away. Growing apprehensive, Yoren leaves ten recruits to guard the wagons and splits the rest up to search the town while he investigates the towerhouse. [[Woth]] once pulled an oar on a galley, so Yoren orders him to take Arya, Gendry, Hot Pie, and Lommy to search for boats. \n\nThe docks are empty except for a rotten rowboat, and Arya realizes the people took all the boats when they fled. Lommy and Hot Pie suggest they search a nearby inn for food and ale, but Woth insists on sticking to Yoren\'s orders. Despondent, Arya washes her face in the lake and wonders if she could swim all the way to [[Winterfell]]. Woth shouts at her to help search, so she does, but they only find some sails and nails.\n\nIt is dark when Yoren returns to report the towerhouse empty. He dismisses suggestions of patching the rowboat or building a new one, but he is intrigued by Gendry\'s idea of a raft. However, a raft would mean leaving the wagons and staying close to shore, so Yoren decides to sleep on it. Lommy asks if they can stay at the inn, but Yoren chooses the holdfast for its protective wall. Arya argues they should not stay at all since even the lord ran away. Lommy mocks her as scared, but Yoren declares her reasoning smart, except the Night\'s Watch takes no part and nobody is their enemy. Arya thinks that nobody is their friend either, but she remains silent to avoid seeming craven. \n\nThe holdfast is surrounded by a ten-foot wall of rough-cut stone with iron bars to brace the front gate. Besides the main gate, there is a postern to the north and a narrow tunnel that leads to the lakeshore hidden under the barn. Yoren has them park a wagon on the trap door to make sure nobody enters that way. He also assigns three watches and sends Tarber, Kurz, and [[Cutjack]] to keep watch from the towerhouse, telling Kurz to use his hunting horn if danger threatens. They drive their wagons and animals inside and bar the main gate. Dobber, Gendry, and Arya draw cook duty and Arya is set to pluck the goose and two chickens Koss brings in, while Gendry splits wood and Yoren sharpens his dirk. Everyone is quiet during the meal, even Lommy.\n\nArya draws second watch, but when sleep proves difficult she borrows Yoren\'s whetstone and hones [[Needle]] instead. Hot Pie asks where she got such a good sword, more politely than [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 1|before]] and she admits [[Jon Snow|her brother]] gave it to her. Hot Pie is surprised, as Arya has never mentioned any brothers. Arya replies that she has lots of brothers, but when Hot Pie asks whether they are older or younger than her, she lies that they are all older, with longswords, and they taught her how to kill people who bother her. Hot Pie insists he was just talking, but then leaves her alone. Curling up on her pallet, Arya is annoyed by the [[Weasel|crying girl]], who is crying as usual.\n\nArya dreams of a wolf howling and wakes at once. Pulling on her boots, she asks if anyone else heard anything. Lommy mocks her for having wolves in her head, and Woth and [[Gerren]] assure her the wolves are safely outside. Arya insists there was a wolf, and before the others can shout her down they hear Kurz\' hunting horn. In a heartbeat, everyone is dressing and arming themselves, while Arya rushes to the gate. As she passes the barn, [[Jaqen H\'ghar]] calls out for her to free the criminals so they can fight, but she ignores him.\n\nClimbing the parapet, Arya glimpses hundreds of men with torches setting fire to the town. Gendry asks how many there are, but they are moving too fast to count. Soon a column of riders approaches the holdfast. Arya thinks their banner might be red, but the fires turn everything red, orange, or black. Reining up before the gates, a knight in a spiked helm demands they open it in the name of the king. [[Reysen]] sarcastically asks which king, earning him a cuff from Woth. \n\n[[File:Lorch.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Ser Amory Lorch \xe2\x80\x93 by Amok\xc2\xa9]]\n\nWhen Yoren explains that the townsfolk are gone, the knight suggests Yoren might be one of [[Beric Dondarrion]]\'s men and [[Thoros of Myr]] could be hiding with them. Yoren insists he only has some lads for the Night\'s Watch and shows his black cloak as evidence, but the knight\'s banner-bearer insists it could be [[House Dondarrion]]\'s purple lighting bolt on black. Arya now recognizes the Lannister banner and remembers that Beric Dondarrion was the man [[Eddard Stark|her father]] [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 43|sent out]] to behead Ser [[Gregor Clegane]].\n\nThe knight demands they open the gate or be known as outlaws, but Yoren demands to know who is in command. A stout man with a manticore on his shield rides forward to introduce himself as Ser [[Amory Lorch]], bannerman to Lord [[Tywin Lannister]], and repeat the order to open the holdfast in the name of the \'\'true\'\' king, [[Joffrey Baratheon]]. Yoren says it does not matter to him if they burn the town, but his band are not their foes and should be left alone. Arya is bewildered that the raiders cannot see they are neither lords nor knights, but Gendry opines that they simply do not care. Looking at Ser Amory\'s face the way [[Syrio Forel]] taught her, Arya realizes Gendry is right.\n\nSer Amory insists his men be allowed to verify Yoren\'s story, but Yoren senses a trick and refuses again. Lorch\'s men mock the old recruiter, and Lorch commands a final time to open the gate. Yoren considers for a long moment before refusing again. Lorch declares them rebels, be they black brothers or not. Yoren informs Lorch that he has some young boys with him, but Lorch declares they will die just the same. He gives a languid signal and a spear hurtles toward Yoren, but kills Woth instead. Lorch orders his men to storm the walls and kill everyone. More spears fly, followed by torches.\n\n[[File:For Family and Honor by feliciacano.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Arya fighting with Needle \xe2\x80\x93 by Felicia Cano - FFG\xc2\xa9]]\n\nYoren commands them to spread out and hold the walls. Arya finds herself next to Hot Pie, who panics and says he does not know how to fight. Arya lies that it is easy and pushes aside a sudden terror to scream, &quot;Winterfell!&quot; and hack at the first hand to appear on the parapet. Warned by Hot Pie, Arya forces the next climber back off the wall. Following her example, Hot Pie hacks the hand of a third. Ser Amory and his men have no ladders, but the walls are rough enough to climb, so there is no end to the foes, and each man they defeat is immediately replaced.\n\nArya sees Yoren drive his dirk into the knight in the spiked helm, and watches Koss shoot down four axemen attacking the gate. She sees the Lannister banner again and wishes Joffrey was present for her to stab. Dobber wrestles a man of the walk and Lommy smashes his head, yet Lommy\'s celebration is cut short when he sees Dobber\'s body with the man\'s knife in his belly. She hears [[Qyle]] beg for mercy until a knight with a wasp sigil smashes his face with a spiked mace. \n\nThe smells of blood, smoke, iron, and piss blur together. Arya, Gendry, and Hot Pie wrestle a skinny man to the ground. Gendry breaks his sword on the man\'s helm, which falls off to reveal an old, frightened face. Arya feels sorry for the man, even as she and Hot Pie are killing him. Gendry takes the man\'s sword and leaps down into the yard, looking for foes. Arya notices more enemies have invaded the holdfast and follows Gendry, but then she is uncertain which way to go, since death is all around her.\n\nSuddenly, Yoren is shaking her. He declares that the battle is lost, and orders her to gather as many survivors as she can and escape through the tunnel under the barn. Quick as that, he storms off again to rejoin the fighting. Arya grabs Gendry and explains the plan. They call Hot Pie down from the walk and find Lommy bleeding from a spear wound in his calf. They find find Gerren too, but he is too seriously wounded. The crying girl will not walk, even when slapped, so Arya has to drag her while the others race ahead.\n\n[[File:A man Rorge and Biter.png|thumb|320px|left|Jaqen, Rorge, and Biter \xe2\x80\x93 by Sir-Heartsalot- FFG\xc2\xa9]]\n\nThe barn is on fire when she arrives, and Hot Pie urges her to just leave the girl behind, but Arya stubbornly continues to drag her. Hot Pie abandons them and scuttles back inside, but Gendry comes back to hoist the girl over his shoulder. The barn feels like a furnace. The back wall is ablaze and the animals are kicking and screaming. Inside their wagon, [[Biter]] and Rorge struggle frantically to get free while Jaqen H\'ghar calls out to Arya in his friendly voice. The trap door is only a few feet ahead and the fire is spreading fast, which reminds Arya of [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]]\'s horrible burned face. Gendry wonders how to get the little girl through the narrow tunnel. Arya tells him to push her and asks where he left the axe. Eying the prisoners, Gendry says it is by the haven but he would save the animals first. Arya tells him to go ahead with the girl and goes to get the axe. \n\nOutside, she sees Koss killed on the spot after he yields. There is no sign of Yoren, but the axe is where Gendry left it. As she wrenches it loose, a mailed hand grabs her arm. Spinning, she drives the axe up between the man\'s legs, then dashes back to the barn. With heavy smoke pouring out and the animals screaming within, going back into the barn is the hardest thing she has ever done. Inside, the roof has caught fire as well, and flaming bits of wood and straw are raining down. The smoke is so thick she cannot see the wagon, so she crawls toward Biter\'s screams.\n\nFinding the wagon, she throws the axe in and runs for the tunnel. Rorge catches it and starts hacking at the wagon. Arya hears the wagon splinter just before she rolls headfirst into the tunnel. She drops five feet and gets dirt in her mouth, but she does not care. She has crawled only a dozen feet when she hears the barn crash, sending a cloud of hot smoke and black dust billowing up behind her, smelling of hell. She holds her breath and kisses the mud on the floor. Then she cries, but she does not know for whom.\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Arya Stark]]\n*[[Koss]]\n*[[Lommy Greenhands]]\n*[[Yoren]]\n*[[Dobber]]\n*[[Woth]]\n*[[Gerren]]\n*[[Tarber]]\n*[[Hot Pie]]\n*[[Rorge]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Kurz]]\n*[[Reysen]]\n*[[Weasel]]\n*[[Gendry]]\n*[[Cutjack]]\n*[[Biter]]\n*[[Jaqen H\'ghar]]\n*[[Amory Lorch]]\n*[[Urreg]]\n*[[Qyle]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Shella Whent]]\n*[[Nan]]\n*[[Harren Hoare]]\n*[[Aegon I Targaryen]]\n*[[Syrio Forel]]\n*[[Beric Dondarrion]]\n*[[Thoros of Myr]]\n*[[Sansa Stark]]\n*[[Jeyne Poole]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Sandor Clegane]]\n*[[Gregor Clegane]]\n*[[Tywin Lannister]]\n*[[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n|}\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n*Analyses and summary of the chapter [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2011/06/re-read-arya-iv.html in the course of a 10th reread] by Slynt.\xc2\xa0\n*[http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2010/08/arya-tyrion.html Humorous review and summary of the chapter] by Jason.\xc2\xa0\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/02/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-7 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 14]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Arya Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place by the Gods Eye]]\n\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 15, Arya]]</text>\n      <sha1>qan9qxdq7ymqi42d2pnhrinv3ir2qqi</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Feast for Crows-Chapter 20</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5656</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166948</id>\n      <parentid>143241</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-06-05T19:13:05Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3463">{{Infobox Chapter AFfC\n| pov\t\t= [[Brienne of Tarth]]\n| title\t\t= Brienne IV\n| place         = [[Crackclaw Point]] - the [[Whispers]]\n| page\t\t= 280\n| previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 19|The Drowned Man]]\n| current\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 20|Brienne IV]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 21|The Queenmaker]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 14|Brienne III]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 25|Brienne V]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==   \nOn the way to the cove where [[Dick Crabb|Nimble Dick]] led the fool and his two companions, [[Podrick Payne|Pod]] catches Dick looking through [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne\'s]] saddlebags. She knew something like this might happen, and warned Pod to keep an eye on him. But having no recourse but to follow Dick, Brienne and Pod continue on their path to [[Crackclaw Point]]. Dick tells them some of the history of the region, to pass the monotony of their journey. Brienne\'s mistrust of Dick has made him take notice, and she considers how easy it is for her to suspect others, after the mistreatments she has suffered in her life. She remembers getting her revenge on several of her false suitors during the m\xc3\xaal\xc3\xa9e at [[Bitterbridge]], but this has done little to stay her natural distrust. \n\nAs they pass the [[Dyre Den]], Lord [[House Brune of the Dyre Den|Brune]]\'s castle, Pod takes note of a rider a couple miles behind them. When Brienne learns that Dick may have known Lord Brune, she considers the possibility that Dick is a deserter from the war.\nAfter passing through many a treacherous bog and forest, they finally arrive at the ruins of [[Whispers|the Whispers]]. Brienne commands Pod to watch their horses, as she and Dick investigate the ruins. When they find a recently put-out cookfire, Brienne realizes their quarry is still around. \n\nThe trap is soon sprung, and the fool turns out to be [[Shagwell]] of the [[Bloody Mummers]]. Shagwell kills Nimble Dick with his brutal morningstar, then informs Brienne that [[Urswyck]] rode south to [[Oldtown]] with some of the Mummers, while [[Rorge]] headed for [[Saltpans]]. He also reveals a rumor that the &quot;[[Arya Stark|daughter of Lord Stark]]&quot; has last been seen with [[Sandor Clegane]]. \n\nWhen Shagwell\'s two companions attack, Brienne\'s strength and size are too much for [[Pyg]] and [[Timeon]], who fall quickly to her strokes with [[Oathkeeper]]. Squaring off against Shagwell, the Fool is struck in the head by a stone thrown by Podrick. Brienne forces the Fool to dig a grave for Dick, but upon completion of it, the former Brave Companion attacks her. She quickly dispatches him as well, and then she is surprised to hear a laugh from the ruined wall. It is Ser [[Hyle Hunt]], the rider who Pod had spied, sent by [[Randyll Tarly]] to stay at Brienne\'s side in the off chance that she finds [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]].\n\n==References and Notes==\n*The synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/05/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-feast-for-crows-part-14 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Feast for Crows, Part 14].

This amount increases for the higher ranking officers, and for Plumm himself, he must sign a contract for 100,000 dragons along with land and a lordship. After this, he signs the register of the Second Sons using his own blood as ink.\n\nAfter this, he is told to go and find armor for himself and [[Penny]]. He returns to where she is sleeping, and there he notices signs that she may have the [[bloody flux]]. Regardless, she is distraught over the abandonment of the hog and the dog that were part of her show. Tyrion is hiding from her that the two animals have almost definitely been slaughtered by [[Yezzan zo Qaggaz]]\'s men. While they are looking for armor, they find [[Jorah Mormont]] outfitted in a random assortment of armor, which he claims is of decent quality. When Penny tells Tyrion that she dreamt that she was jousting with her brother again, Tyrion slaps her, trying to force her to quit her mooning and to realize that they must wear armor or likely die. Finally, Tyrion says that he will take care of making sure that the Second Sons turn sides again, since Tyrion and Jorah both agree that they are on the losing side of the coming battle. \n\n{{Stub}}\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n* [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n* [[Jorah Mormont]]\n* [[Kasporio]]\n* [[Inkpots]]\n* [[Penny]]\n* [[Brown Ben Plumm]]\n* [[Snatch]]\n* [[Kem]]\n* [[Jaime Lannister]]\n* [[Hammer]]\n* [[Nail]]\n* [[Shae]]\n* [[Tysha]]\n* [[Yezzan zo Qaggaz]]\n* [[Lord Lefford]]\n* [[Nurse]]\n* [[Sweets]]\n* [[Oppo| Oppo (Groat)]]\n}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 66]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Tyrion Lannister]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Meereen]]\n\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 66]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 67, Tyrion]]</text>\n      <sha1>4s3u812w4bvlhv44sglacjklsu39rub</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 23</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6829</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>186201</id>\n      <parentid>166560</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-06-23T06:13:27Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Mindset</username>\n        <id>4579</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3578">{{Infobox Chapter ADwD\n| pov\t\t= [[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n| place         = [[Meereen]]\n| title\t\t= Daenerys IV\n| page\t\t= 293\n| previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 22|Tyrion VI]]\n| current\t= Daenerys IV\n| next\t\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 24|The Lost Lord]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 16|Daenerys III]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 30|Daenerys V]]\n}}\n\n{{Stub}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Galazza Galare]], the [[Green Grace]], appears before [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] to offer once more the suggestion that she marry.

After he leaves, [[Barristan Selmy]] expresses his disapproval, but Dany believes that she still has ninety days to figure out another plan, to see if Hizdahr can prevent the attacks, and if he can she will marry him out of duty to her people.\n\nSer Barristan tells hers that during her assembly with the Green Grace, [[Daario Naharis]] has returned. Dany commands to see him at once, overcome with lust. Despite her growing passion, during the meeting Daario upsets her with his barbaric suggestions as solutions to her problems and she sends him away. Dany tells Barristan to forbid Daario from meeting with her directly ever again, but regrets her decision almost immediately.\n\n==Character List==\n{{columns|5|\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Galazza Galare]]\n*[[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n*[[Missandei]]\n*[[Qezza]]\n*[[Grazhar]]\n*[[Barristan Selmy]]\n*[[Hizdahr zo Loraq]]\n*[[Daario Naharis]]\n*[[Irri]]\n*[[Jhiqui]]\n\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Skahaz mo Kandaq]]\n*[[Hazzea]]\n*[[Cleon]]\n*[[Cleon the Second]]\n*[[King Cutthroat]]\n*[[Queen Whore]]\n*[[Xaro Xhoan Daxos]]\n*[[Aegon I Targaryen]]\n*[[Jaehaerys I Targaryen]]\n*[[Daeron I Targaryen]]\n*[[Mazdhan zo Loraq]]\n*[[Hazrak zo Loraq]]\n*[[Zharaq zo Loraq]]\n*[[Stalwart Shield]]\n*[[Mossador]]\n*[[Rylona Rhee]]\n*[[Aerys II Targaryen]]\n*[[Reznak mo Reznak]]\n*[[Rhaegar Targaryen]]\n*[[Elia Martell]]\n*[[Rhaella Targaryen]]\n*[[Aegon V Targaryen]]\n*[[Ghost of High Heart]]\n*[[Jenny (Oldstones)|Jenny of Oldstones]]\n*[[Drogo|Khal Drogo]]\n*[[Drogon]]\n*[[Viserion]]\n*[[Rhaegal]]\n*[[Grey Worm]]\n*[[Viserys Targaryen]]\n}}\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{columns|7|\n*[[Great Pyramid]]\n*[[White Graces]]\n*[[Qartheen]]\n*[[Skahazadhan]]\n*[[Mother\'s Men]]\n*[[New Ghis]]\n*[[Tolos]]\n*[[Meereen]]\n*[[Great Masters]]\n*[[Mantarys]]\n*[[Ghis]]\n*[[Sons of the Harpy]]\n*[[Brazen Beasts]]\n*[[Astapor]]\n*[[Yunkai]]\n*[[House of Kandaq]]\n*[[House of Loraq]]\n*[[Unsullied]]\n*[[Temple of the Graces]]\n*[[Old Ghis]]\n*[[Sunset Kingdoms]]\n*[[Westeros]]\n*[[Asshai]]\n*[[Lys]]\n*[[Tyrosh]]\n*[[Volantis]]\n*[[Seven Kingdoms]]\n*[[Kingsguard]]\n*[[King\'s Landing]]\n*[[Iron Throne]]\n*[[Children of the Forest]]\n*[[Summerhall]]\n*[[Stormcrows]]\n*[[Dothraki]]\n*[[Arakh]]\n*[[Lhazar]]\n*[[Khyzai Pass]]\n*[[Long Lances]]\n*[[Lamb Men]]\n*[[Dothraki Sea]]\n*[[House of Zhak]]\n*[[House of Pahl]]\n*[[House of Merreq]]\n}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 23]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Daenerys Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Meereen]]\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 23]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 24, Daenerys]]</text>\n      <sha1>a3v6dq4yeep2ao315xu9algvvtqd4gw</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 18</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6824</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166552</id>\n      <parentid>164873</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-25T15:21:55Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3222">{{Infobox Chapter ADwD\n| pov\t\t= [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n| place         = the [[Sorrows]] and [[Chroyane]]\n| title\t\t= Tyrion V\n| page\t\t= 232\n| previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 17|Tyrion IV]]\n| current\t= Tyrion V\n| next\t\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 19|Davos III]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 14|Tyrion IV]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 22|Tyrion VI]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] and his companions aboard the \'\'[[Shy Maid]]\'\' continue their way down the [[Rhoyne]].

The \'\'Shy Maid\'\' floats past the ruins of a palace in the ruins of [[Chroyane]], and Tyrion recalls to himself the brief joy he once had with [[Tysha]].\n\nFearing an attack from the fog, Griff orders Young Griff to accompany Septa [[Lemore]] to safety below deck. Tyrion reveals his knowledge regarding the boy, and confirms bits of information he apparently learned from his previous bet with [[Haldon]]. Young Griff is in fact young [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaegar)|Aegon Targaryen]], although Tyrion is uncertain how he survived the the events following the [[Battle of the Trident|Trident]]. He also comes to the conclusion that Griff is the late [[Rhaegar Targaryen]]\'s friend [[Jon Connington]], the former [[Hand of the King]].\n\nTyrion also reveals his [[House Lannister|Lannister]] roots to the party, but there is no time to discuss loyalties or intentions. The \'\'Shy Maid\'\' is attacked by [[stone men]].

Today she has counted roughly twenty-five. She has an argument with her admiral [[Groleo]], who is advising her to send her dragons to attack the enemy fleet. Daenarys tells him to attack with ships, but he replies that she dismantled his ships, and all the timber in twenty leagues has been burned so he can build no more.\n\n[[Hizdahr zo Loraq|Hizdahr]] has thus far had success in preventing further murders. She has had her betrothed followed and [[Skahaz mo Kandaq]] reports that Hizdahr has visited eleven pyramids and it has been twenty-six days since a murder has been attempted. He surmises that he must be one of the [[Sons of the Harpy]] or else these others would not have listened to his words alone. Skahaz asks that he may question Hizdahr, but Dany will not let him, stating that she must trust in Hizdahr or face open rebellion in the city. Skahaz also advises her that the fleets in the blockade all have family members in [[Meereen]] and that she should use them as hostages, a contemplation she also rejects. [[Barristan Selmy]] advises her that she has done a wise thing.\n\n[[Grey Worm]] meets with her next to tell her that the first refugees from [[Astapor]] are arriving in Meereen and that Astapor is burning. Dany learns of [[Siege of Astapor|the fall of Astapor]], and that many inhabitants have contracted the [[bloody flux]] while under siege, with the survivors now fleeing towards Meereen.{{Ref|ADWD|30|pages 398-402}}&lt;ref&gt;Daenerys believes the &quot;pale mare&quot; part of her vision of [[Quaithe]] in [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 11|Chapter 11]] to refer to this disease. The bloody flux was also mentioned in [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 25|Chapter 25]]&lt;/ref&gt; The survivors also say that they believed and waited everyday for Daenerys to come and save them. She tells them that they will be safe in Meereen now. Dany is advised not to let the survivors and their illness into the city, and reminded again of [[Eroeh]] and of how sometimes those whom she tries to save end up worse off.\n\nThere are further appeals to use the dragons, however they are followed with comments that they cannot be controlled right now, and even the [[Unsullied]] are afraid to go into the dragon pit to feed them. Dany says she cannot and will not unleash the dragons at this point in time. Ultimately she decides not to let the Astapori into the city and that they should have a separate camp outside the city until the flux passes.\n\nSer Barristan appeals to her to take the battle to the enemy. She then reminds herself that a queen represents her people and not just her own person. She thus decides that she cannot have the Unsullied take the field or else she would have to leave the [[Brazen Beasts]] alone to defend against the Sons of the Harpy which will not suffice. She then says that she must marry Hizdahr, for the good of the city.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 30]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Daenerys Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Meereen]]\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 30]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 31, Daenerys]]</text>\n      <sha1>s235r5dqxb1zf9bi3jmh74zzttptysq</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Feast for Crows-Chapter 32</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5744</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>184254</id>\n      <parentid>166960</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-05-22T21:27:31Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Mindset</username>\n        <id>4579</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <minor/>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3735">{{Infobox Chapter AFfC\n| pov\t\t= [[Cersei Lannister]]\n| title\t\t= Cersei VII\n| place         = [[King\'s Landing]]\n| page\t\t= 473\n| previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 31|Brienne VI]]\n| current\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 32|Cersei VII]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 33|Jaime V]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 28|Cersei VI]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 36|Cersei VIII]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]] is fuming at [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] and [[Small Council|her council]] that the Throne must respond at once to the [[Battle of the Shield Islands|ironmen\'s attack on the Shield Islands]]. Cersei does not appreciate the young queen\'s tone, and claims that it must fall to [[House Tyrell|Highgarden]] to retake &quot;these rocks&quot;. [[Loras Tyrell]] interjects as his sister seethes, stating that his brothers [[Willas Tyrell|Willas]] and [[Garlan Tyrell|Garlan]] have the men, but not the ships, to win back the islands. He requests that Cersei pull Lord [[Paxter Redwyne|Redwyne]]\'s fleet from their [[siege of Dragonstone]], so they may return to gather troops at the [[Arbor]]. The Queen Regent denies his request, implying that the Redwyne fleet would not depart until [[Dragonstone]] fell. Knowing that Lord Paxter intended to starve them out, Ser Loras asks leave to lead the assault, and promises Cersei Dragonstone within a fortnight. Pleased by this unexpected &quot;gift&quot;, Cersei grants him permission.\n\nReturning to her apartments, [[Pycelle]] objects to her sending Loras, but Cersei is hoping the knight will die besieging the walls of Dragonstone; but if not, she would still strike a blow against [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]. When she meets [[Qyburn]], he mentions that he has a &quot;champion&quot; to replace Loras should he fall. Cersei is not so sure of Qyburn\'s &quot;paragon&quot;, and informs him that the smiths she hired believe the weight of the armor he requested cannot be borne by a human. \n\nLater, in bed, Lady [[Taena of Myr|Taena]] asks her certain questions; Cersei becomes concerned the woman may report her answers to Margaery. But Taena assures her that all her secrets are safe. However, their chat is interrupted by a guard pounding on her door with word that [[Falyse Stokeworth]] begged to see her. Cersei finds the woman battered, and listens to the tale of [[Balman Byrch|her husband]]\'s death. After [[Bronn]] defeated him in single combat, but before killing him, Bronn forced Ser Balman to confess who put him up to this. Bronn then told Falyse to leave immediately or meet the same fate. When Falyse told [[Tanda Stokeworth|her mother]]\'s guards to arrest Bronn, they laughed and told her to listen to &quot;Lord Stokeworth&quot;. Fearful that Falyse would spread rumors of Cersei\'s involvement, Cersei summons Lord Qyburn so that he could take another female subject to his lab in the [[black cells]]. Back in her room, a very inebriated Cersei contemplates how to deal with Bronn, and then begins to fondle Taena, &quot;claiming her rights as queen&quot; the way [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] would do to her when he was drunk.\n\n==References and Notes==\n*The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/07/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-feast-for-crows-part-23 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Feast for Crows, Part 23].

Arstan admits that Rhaegar was a great warrior, but he won no battles. \n\nLater, [[Jorah Mormont|Jorah]] tells her that Arstan is more than he seems, and warns her not to trust him.

The Unsullied are eunuch slaves trained to obey orders absolutely, and they feel no pain. Daenerys agrees that she will force Captain [[Groleo]] and Strong [[Belwas]] to change course. Ser Jorah then grabs her by the waist and kisses her.

Entering the fire, [[Stannis Baratheon]] draws out the sword [[Lightbringer]] and [[Melisandre]] proclaims him [[Azor Ahai]] reborn. Later, Davos hears new of the war from the pirate [[Salladhor Saan]], who insists Stannis\' new sword is not the true Lightbringer. That night, Davos and Stannis discuss his plan to claim the [[Iron Throne]]. When Davos asks why he supports Melisandre\'s [[R\'hllor|foreign god]], Stannis explains that he means to discover Melisandre\'s true power.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:Davos Seaworth.jpg|200px||left|thumb|Davos Seaworth - by Amok \xc2\xa9]]\n\n[[Davos Seaworth]] is among the hundreds watching the statues of the [[Faith of the Seven|Seven]] burn outside the gates of [[Dragonstone]]. His sons [[Allard Seaworth|Allard]] and [[Dale Seaworth|Dale]] agree that it is an ill thing to burn the gods, but Davos cautions them that this is not the place. The red priestess [[Melisandre]] walks around the fire, praying in three tongues for [[R\'hllor]], the Lord of Light, to accept these false gods of the enemy and cast light upon them. The prayer ends with the sacred refrain, &quot;For the night is dark and full of terrors.&quot; Queen [[Selyse Baratheon|Selyse]] echoes the words, but King [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] only watches impassively.\n\nDragonstone\'s sept was where [[Aegon I Targaryen]] knelt to pray before he embarked upon his [[War of Conquest|conquest]], but that did not save it from the queen\'s men. They overturned the altars, pulled down the statues, and smashed the stained glass. Davos recalls that the statues were originally carved from the masts of the ships that carried the first [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]]s from [[Valyria]]. [[Septon]] [[Barre]] could only curse them, but Ser [[Hubard Rambton]] and his three sons slew four men before they were overwhelmed. Afterward, pious Lord [[Guncer Sunglass]] withdrew his support for Stannis and was imprisoned along with the septon and Ser Hubard\'s two surviving sons.\n\nThough he has never been devout, the burning gods make Davos feel ill. Lord [[Ardrian Celtigar]] coughs from the smoke and Lord [[Duram Bar Emmon]] turns grey, but Lord [[Monford Velaryon]] watches Stannis rather than the fire. Davos wonders what Velaryon is thinking, but knows such a proud lord will never confide in him. The lords all scorn Davos and his sons, but one day their grandsons will joust together. In time Davos imagines his sigil will fly as high as theirs, but only if Stannis wins his throne, since everything Davos is he owes to Stannis. It was Stannis who gave Davos his knighthood and his war galley \'\'[[Black Betha]]\'\'. His sons Dale and Allard captain ships of their own, [[Maric Seaworth|Maric]] is oarmaster on the \'\'[[Fury]]\'\', [[Matthos Seaworth|Matthos]] serves as Davos\' mate, [[Devan Seaworth|Devan]] is  a royal squire who will one day be a knight, and his two [[Stannis Seaworth|youngest]] [[Steffon Seaworth|sons]] will one day be knights as well. His wife [[Marya Seaworth|Marya]] is mistress of a small keep, and Davos can hunt deer in his own woods. All this he has of Stannis for the price of a few finger joints, taken as just punishment for flaunting the law all his life. As he thinks back, Davos touches the pouch around his neck where he keeps his finger bones for luck; they will all need luck soon.\n\n[[File:King in the narrow sea by reneaigner.jpg|400px|right|thumb|Stannis\' flaming sword - by Rene Aigner\xc2\xa9]]\n\nMelisandre recounts an ancient prophecy that at the end of a long summer, when the stars bleed and darkness falls over world, [[Azor Ahai]] will be reborn and draw the burning sword [[Lightbringer]] from the fire and destroy the darkness. Then she calls upon Azor Ahai to claim his sword and Stannis marches forward. His squires, Devan Seaworth and [[Bryen Farring]], equip him with a padded glove and leather cape. Using the cape to ward off the flames, Stannis plunges into the fire and draws out a near-molten sword from the statue of the [[Mother (the Seven)|Mother]]. Queen Selyse and her queen\'s men chant praises, and Melisandre names the sword Lightbringer and declares Stannis Azor Ahai come again. The cherry-red sword is burning his glove, so Stannis thrusts it into the dirt.\n\nMelisandre calls upon R\'hllor to cast light upon them, and Selyse and the queen\'s men reply that the night is dark and full of terrors. Then Melisandre sings a song in the [[Asshai]]\'i language until only charwood remains of the gods. Impatient, Stannis escorts his queen back into Dragonstone, leaving Lightbringer in the dirt for his squires to collect. Davos notes that the burnt and blackened Red Sword of Heroes looks a proper mess. A few lords linger, speaking quietly, but they fall silent when they see Davos looking at them. Davos knows that these lords will pull him down if Stannis should fall, but neither will he court the favor of Queen Selyse by giving himself to this new Lord of Light.\n\nWhen the fire starts to dwindle, Melisandre and the squires depart with the sword, and Davos and his sons join the crowd headed for the harbor. Davos comments that Devan did well as the king\'s squire. Allard asks why the king\'s squires wore [[House Baratheon of Dragonstone|fiery heart]] sigils in place of the [[House Baratheon|crowned stag]]. Davos points out that a lord can choose more than one badge. Allard insists that it was an ill thing to burn the Seven. Davos asks when Allard grew so devout and what a smuggler\'s son would know of the gods\' doings. Allard insists he is a knight\'s son and asks why the lords should remember Davos is a knight if he does not himself. Davos points out that Allard will never be a knight if he meddles in affairs that do not concern him; it is not for them to question their rightful king. His sons do not like to recall they were lowborn, and when they look at [[House Seaworth]]\'s sigil they see only the black ship and close their eyes to the onion.\n\n[[File:Salladhor Saan.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Salladhor Saan - by Amok \xc2\xa9]]\n\nIn the extremely crowded port, Davos enters an inn, where he finds the flamboyant [[Lys]]ene pirate [[Salladhor Saan]] eating grapes. A friend and business partner from his smuggling days, it was Davos who recruited Saan to Stannis\' cause. When Davos asks why he did not attend the burning, Salladhor explains that such sights are common in Lys. They bore him, and hopefully they will soon bore Stannis.\n\nSalladhor explains that one of his [[Bird of Thousand Colors|trading ships]] arrived from [[King\'s Landing]] with news that [[Tyrion Lannister]] is now overseeing the capital and has driven out [[Janos Slynt]] as commander of the [[City Watch of King\'s Landing|City Watch]]. Davos asks how well the city is defended. Saan replies that the walls are strong, but defended only by the gold cloaks, who are too few and inexperienced. He urges a swift strike to take the city, and then Tyrion could be dressed as a fool and Queen [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] could warm his bed for a night as part of his payment. Davos assures Salladhor he will be paid, but the pirate insists he wants gold, not words. Davos promises there is gold in the treasury at King\'s Landing, and Stannis is the most honorable man in the [[Seven Kingdoms]].\n\nSalladhor again urges an attack on the capital, but Davos asks how long they could hold it with [[Tywin Lannister]] and [[Renly Baratheon]] against them. Saan reveals Renly has left [[Highgarden]] with his army and his [[Margaery Tyrell|new queen]] to march on King\'s Landing. That Renly brought his bride along surprises Davos; it suggests either great love or great confidence. Davos declares that Stannis must be told, but Salladhor has already done so, though Stannis seems to disapprove of the pirate.\n\nAbruptly, Salladhor claims Stannis\' sword is not the true Lightbringer and asks how a burnt sword will serve Stannis. Davos corrects that it is a \'\'burning\'\' sword, but Saan insists it is burnt. He recounts the legend of how, after two failed attempts, Azor Ahai labored a hundred days and nights on a hero\'s blade to oppose darkness. Then he tempered the sword in his wife [[Nissa Nissa]]\'s heart and her blood, soul, courage, and strength went into the steel to create Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes. Salladhor tells Davos to be thankful the sword Stannis raised is not real because, &quot;Too much light can hurt the eyes, and fire burns.&quot;\n\nSalladhor asks when Stannis will sail, and Davos replies that it depends on the will of the king\'s new god. Salladhor asks who Davos\' god is. Cautious of his surroundings, Davos replies that his god is King Stannis, who made him and blessed him with trust. Salladhor says he will remember and excuses himself, declaring they will soon feast in the Red Keep. He also asks Davos to remind Stannis he will owe another 30,000 dragons come the black of the moon, commenting that the statues they burnt might have brought a noble price. He jokes that if Stannis grants him Queen Cersei for a night he shall forgive him.\n\nDavos  lingers in the inn, thinking of Thoros of Myr and his flaming sword, though there was no true magic in that sword. A true sword of fire would be a wonder, but when he thinks of Nissa Nissa it is his own wife Marya he pictures, and he decides the price is more than he cares to pay.\n\nAfter dark, Devan arrives with a summons from King Stannis. When Davos arrives, the important bannermen are leaving. Ser [[Axell Florent]], the foremost of the queen\'s men, asks what Davos thought of the burning gods and explains he saw a vision of the glory awaiting Stannis when they take King\'s Landing. Davos replies that all he saw was fire and pushes past, wondering why Ser Axell bothered, since Davos is the king\'s man as much as Axell is the queen\'s.\n\nDavos finds Stannis seated at the Painted Table with [[Maester]] [[Pylos]]. Stannis commands Davos to have a look at his letter. Davos obediently selects a paper before pointing out that he is illiterate. Mildly irritated, Stannis commands Maester Pylos to read the letter instead:\n\n{{Quote|All men know me for the trueborn son of [[Steffon Baratheon]], Lord of Storm\xe2\x80\x99s End, by his lady wife [[Cassana Estermont|Cassana]] of [[House Estermont]]. I declare upon the honor of my House that my beloved brother [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]], our late king, left no trueborn issue of his body, the boy [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], the boy [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], and the girl [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]] being abominations born of incest between [[Cersei Lannister]] and her brother [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] the Kingslayer. By right of birth and blood, I do this day lay claim to the [[Iron Throne]] of the Seven Kingdoms of [[Westeros]]. Let all true men declare their loyalty. Done in the Light of the Lord, under the sign and seal of Stannis of House Baratheon, the First of His Name, King of the Andals, the [[Rhoynar]], and the [[First Men]], and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.}}\n\nStannis orders Pylos to add &quot;Ser&quot; to Jaime\'s name since he is still a knight, and to remove &quot;beloved brother&quot; since it is a lie. Then he declares all of their 117 ravens will be used to carry copies across the realm, though most will likely be burnt by lords who support the other kings even though Stannis is their rightful king. Therefore, Stannis orders Davos to sail north as far as [[White Harbor]] while his son Dale sails south as far as [[the Arbor]]. They are to post the declaration in every port and fishing village they pass for every man who can to read. Davos points out that few smallfolk can read and requests knights to read the declarations aloud. Stannis agrees, since he has a hundred knights who would rather read than fight. He plans to send Allard across the [[narrow sea]] to carry the declaration to the [[Free Cities]] as well, so that all the world will know of his claim and Cersei\'s infamy.\n\nAfter Stannis dismisses Pylos, Davos asks what the lords thought of the letter. Stannis snorts that they all flattered him except Velaryon, who said steel would decide the matter as if Stannis never suspected as much. Stannis curses his lords and asks Davos for the truth. Davos declares the words blunt and strong, but reminds Stannis they still have no firm proof of incest. Stannis replies there is proof of a sort at [[Storm\'s End]]: [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]]\'s acknowledged bastard [[Edric Storm]] is the very image of Robert, yet his supposed sons [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] and [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] look nothing like him. Davos reminds Stannis that they cannot reach Edric at Storm\'s End.\n\n[[File:Melisandre by henning.jpg|320px||right|thumb|Melisandre of Asshai, Stannis\' &quot;red hawk&quot; - by Henning Ludvigsen\xc2\xa9]]\n\nDavos also suggests removing the reference to the Lord of Light from the letter in favor of a something less specific. When Stannis asks if he has become devout, Davos says he does not know this new god but knew the ones they burned. Stannis argues that it was only wood they burned, but Davos mentions that charitable septons would feed him when he was a begging boy. Davos explains that the people will not love Stannis if he takes away their familiar gods and gives them a foreign one. Stannis replies that the people have never loved him.\n\t\nGazing out the window, Stannis declares he stopped believing in gods the day he saw the \'\'[[Windproud]]\'\' break up on [[Shipbreaker Bay]], refusing to worship any gods monstrous enough to drown his parents. The [[High Septon]] always prattles about justice and goodness flowing from the gods, but Stannis insists all he ever saw of either was made by men. Davos asks why Stannis would trouble with a new god if he does not believe. Stannis answers that, god or no god, Melisandre has power. Davos replies that Maester [[Cressen]] had wisdom, but Stannis argues that Cressen\'s wise advice did no good: the [[Stormlands|storm lords]] laughed when he went begging. Stannis declares there will be no more begging or laughing. The Iron Throne is rightfully his, but of the four kings he has the fewest men and the least gold. His only assets are his ships and the red woman. Stannis asks if Davos knows that half his men are afraid to even speak her name; a sorceress who can inspire such dread is not to be despised, and he means to find out if she can do more.\n\nStannis recalls that as a boy he nursed an injured goshawk named [[Proudwing]], who would follow him about and eat from his hand but would not hunt. Finally, his great-uncle Ser [[Harbert]] told him, rightly, that he should try a different bird because he was embarrassing himself. Stannis turns back to Davos and declares that the Seven have never brought him so much as a sparrow. It is time he tried another hawk, a red hawk.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n===See also===\n* [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2011/06/re-read-davos-i-whos-scruffy-looking.html Review and analyses of the chapter in the course of a 10th reread]. \n* [http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2010/03/davos-theon.html Humorous review of the chapter]. \n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/02/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-5 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 10]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Davos Seaworth]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Dragonstone]]\n\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 11, Davos]]</text>\n      <sha1>a43x5gm9hj9yzb1vmvei5q8macbrktz</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 74</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5810</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>174776</id>\n      <parentid>155836</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-10-14T04:30:57Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Mindset</username>\n        <id>4579</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4447">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Arya Stark|Arya]]\n| title\t\t= Arya XIII\n| place         = [[Inn at the Crossroads]] - [[Saltpans]]\n| page\t\t= 843\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 73|Jon X]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 74|Arya XIII]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 75|Samwell IV]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 65|Arya XII]]\n| arc next\t=\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:Arya tickler by tribemun.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Arya Stabbing the Tickler &lt;br&gt; by Tribemun\xc2\xa9]]\n[[Sandor Clegane|Sandor]] and [[Arya Stark|Arya]] come to the [[Inn at the Crossroads]]. To her dismay, she recognizes [[Polliver]] and the [[Tickler]] and [[Sarsfield squire|a squire]]. The squire tries to bait Sandor with insults about fleeing King\'s Landing and the room is very tense.  The Hound demands wine, which the innkeeper brings and Sandor gulps down. Sandor warns the innkeeper that Polliver and the Tickler will kill him instead of paying for their drinks, and the innkeeper and the other people in the room leave. &lt;!-- ??? --&gt;\n\nThe [[Tickler]] tells Sandor what has happened in the realm, including [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion\'s]] marriage, [[Joffrey  Baratheon|Joffrey\'s]] death and Tyrion\'s imprisonment. He claims that [[Sansa Stark|Sansa\'s]] sister has been found and is to marry [[Ramsay Bolton]], [[Harrenhal]] has been taken by [[Gregor Clegane]], [[Riverrun]] is under siege by the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] and [[Randyll Tarly]] has taken [[Saltpans]]. He says only the Blackwoods are still holding out, and the Brackens are fighting them around [[Raventree Hall]]. \n\nThe Tickler says Gregor would prefer that Sandor come back with them to Harrenhal, but when Sandor refuses, the Tickler throws a knife at him. Sandor, the Tickler and Polliver all draw swords and begin to fight. The squire tries to join in but Arya throws a cup at him and knocks him down. Sandor is not fighting his best and Arya realizes he drank his wine too fast and is drunk. During the fight Arya stabs the squire in the belly and then sneaks up behind the Tickler and stabs him over and over again in a rage until Sandor stops her. The squire is still alive but was mortally wounded and asks for mercy. Sandor tells Arya to give him mercy, and asks if she remembers where the heart is. She does.  She recovers [[Needle]], which was carried by Polliver, and kills the squire.\n\nSandor, seriously wounded, says Gregor must hold the ford and that they will make for Saltpans and find a ship to the [[Vale]]. They leave the inn to travel on but the Hound is so wounded that he needs tending and they stop. The next day he is so weak that he falls out of his saddle. While he lies in a fevered sleep, Arya thinks about killing him. He wakes to see what she is contemplating and urges her to do it - to give him mercy - but Arya leaves him and rides on to Saltpans. \n\nShe tries to find a boat that goes to the North but only finds a trading ship [[Titan\'s Daughter]] with [[Braavos]] as its destination.

The Lord Commander plans to reinforce the stone ring built by the [[First Men]] during the [[Dawn Age]] to wait for men from the [[Shadow Tower]] here, and then to wait for [[Mance Rayder]] to return from the [[Frostfangs]]. [[Ghost]] finally joins [[Jon Snow]] in the ring, surprising Jon since Ghost has previously refused to come into the ring. Ghost leads him to some buried [[Dragonglass]] weapons wrapped in a cloak of the [[Night\'s Watch]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nLord Commander [[Jeor Mormont|Mormont]]\'s men arrive at the [[Fist of the First Men]]. [[Jon Snow]] thinks that it actually looks like a fist plunging up from the ground. The commander tells [[Thoren Smallwood]] it is good ground, and he replies it is an old place that is strong and will be easy to defend. The commander agrees they are not likely to find a better place to defend. Its disadvantage, pointed out by Jon, is that they will have to climb down to get water. Their camp is made behind a stone ring built by the [[First Men]] during the [[Dawn Age]].\n\nAs they climbed, [[Ghost]] ran off, and Jon had to keep calling him back, but the commander finally grew impatient and told Jon to let him go. Jon Snow can tell the travelling is wearing on the Lord Commander, but he tries not to let it show. \n\nAfter putting up the Lord Commander\xe2\x80\x99s tent and seeing to the horses, he descends to find Ghost, who suddenly appears next to him. He feels a growing sense of foreboding. He climbs some rocks from where he can see the [[Milkwater]] river and the rugged landscape giving way to high stony hills to the north. When darkness starts to arrive, Jon is interrupted by [[Samwell Tarly]]. Jon tells Sam that the commander plans to stay here and wait for [[Qhorin Halfhand]] and the men from the [[Shadow Tower]], and he should get a raven ready since the commander will want to send a message. Sam states the ravens hate being caged, and if he could fly he would be back at [[Castle Black]] and be eating pork pie. \n\nThey return to camp. Overhead, the red tail of [[Red Comet|Mormont\xe2\x80\x99s Torch]] is as bright as the moon. When they arrive, Jon leaves to attend to the Lord Commander. Mormont, who is talking to some of his officers, tells Jon to bring some hot spiced wine. As he prepares the wine, he hears [[Jarman Buckwell]] state that following the Milkwater would be the easiest road to the [[Frostfangs]], but [[Mance Rayder]] will know of their approach. Ser [[Mallador Locke]] recommends [[Giant\'s Stair]] or [[Skirling Pass]]. Mormont states he does not want to risk the Frostfangs unless he must. He plans to remain at the Fist since the [[Free Folk|Wildlings]] outnumber them, and the Wildlings will have to come from the Frostfangs eventually for food; they will strengthen their defenses. The rangers will limit their ranging to this side of the river since Mormont is sure that [[Craster]] did not lie to them about Mance gathering his force in the Frostfangs. The officers finish their wine and leave.\n\nJon offers the commander supper, and he asks if Ghost found any game since they could use meat, and then asks if Jon agrees with keeping the rangers close. Jon replies that if they stay close, they are unlikely to find his uncle [[Benjen Stark]]. The commander responds that it would be easier for one man to find 200 than for 200 to find one, and the land is too vast to search with their limited manpower. \nThey have left a very visible trail, and the fires on the Fist should be visible to the foothills of the Frostfangs. Jon then brings up the case that his uncle is dead, and the commander replies that he still may return anyway as a [[Others#Wrights|Wight]]. The commander then tells Jon he will forsake supper and to wake him at first light.\n\nHowever, Jon is hungry, and joins [[Dywen]], [[Grenn]], [[Eddison Tollett|Dolorous Edd]], and [[Hake]] for the stew. Dywen states there is a smell he does not like, a smell of cold. Jon hears a howling and then Ghost appears, surprising Jon since he has previously refused to come inside the ring. Ghost seems preoccupied, sniffing the air. Suddenly Jon is alarmed since Ghost knew when the dead came walking, and Dywen has said he smelled cold. Ghost starts to go, and then looks back, so Jon follows, leaving the protection of the ring. Ghost stops at the stream, and then goes on, so Jon follows, angry. He loses Ghost a quarter of the way around the Fist. When he catches up with Ghost again, he is digging at a mound that has been dug only recently. He expects to find a body, but finds a bundle two feet across. Inside the bundle made from a cloak of the [[Night\'s Watch]], he finds [[Dragonglass]] weapons.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n*Summary and analyses of the chapter [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2011/12/jon-iv-not-listening-to-awesomewolf.html in the course of a 10th reread].\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/04/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-16 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 34]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Jon Snow]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in the Fist of the First Men]]\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 34]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 35, Jon]]</text>\n      <sha1>c7n286xevbu2hm0r4xltgwh0rop6r0q</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Game of Thrones-Chapter 70</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6039</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>183780</id>\n      <parentid>166012</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-05-08T21:17:09Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10950">{{Infobox Chapter AGoT\n| pov\t\t= [[Jon Snow]]\n| place         = [[Castle Black]]- [[Mole\'s Town]] and areas to the south of it\n| title\t\t= Jon IX\n| page\t\t= 645\n| previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 69|Tyrion IX]]\n| current\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 70|Jon IX]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 71|Catelyn XI]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 60|Jon VIII]]\n| arc next\t=\n}} __NOTOC__\n\n[[Jon Snow|Jon]] deserts in the middle of the night, determined to join his brother [[Robb Stark|Robb]] in the quest for vengeance. South of [[Mole\'s Town]], his friends catch up and bring him back. In the morning, [[Lord Commander of the Night\'s Watch|Lord Commander]] [[Jeor Mormont|Mormont]] reveals he knows about the night\xe2\x80\x99s events and convinces Jon to stay and join him on a [[The Great Ranging|great ranging]] [[beyond the Wall]].\n\n==Synopsis==    \nLate at night, [[Jon Snow|Jon]] saddles a mare in the stables of [[Castle Black]]. As he mounts up, [[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] appears in the doorway, insisting that Jon cannot do this. Jon warns Sam to get out of his way since he does not want to hurt him. When the fat boy refuses, Jon spurs his horse and forces Sam to leap out of the way, stumbling and falling. The mare leaps over Sam. As he heads south down the [[kingsroad]], Jon hopes that Sam has not hurt himself getting out of the way.\n\nThe whole castle is silent and there is no one to see him leave; all the sentries are atop [[the Wall]], looking north. Jon trusts that Sam loves him enough to give him a head start. In truth, he does not believe the timid boy can summon the courage to disturb the guards to wake the [[Lord Commander of the Night\'s Watch|Lord Commander]] in the night. As he rides, Jon flexes his burnt hand, appreciating having the bandages off.\n\t\nJon stays on the kingsroad in the moonlight, knowing that he must get as far from Castle Black as he can before dawn, planning to then go overland to confuse the pursuit. When he fails to bring the Lord Commander\xe2\x80\x99s breakfast at dawn they will search his cell, discover [[Longclaw]], and know he has deserted. It was hard to leave the sword, but in the end Jon followed [[Jorah Mormont]]\xe2\x80\x99s example. The thought of betraying old [[Jeor Mormont]]\xe2\x80\x99s trust bothers Jon, but it cannot be helped. Jon is still not sure he is doing the honorable thing. Jon thinks that the southerners have it easier; they can talk to their [[Faith of the Seven#Septon|septons]] to help sort out right from wrong whereas the [[Weirwood|heart trees]] do not talk.\n\nOnce out of sight of Castle Black, Jon slows his pace to spare the horse. He hopes to trade her for a new one and cannot do that if she is injured or blown. He will also require an entire set of new clothes; his black wool, leather, and steel will draw the suspicions of everyone north of [[the Neck]]. Once Maester [[Aemon Targaryen (son of Maekar I)|Aemon]]\'s ravens take flight, not even [[Winterfell]] will offer refuge to him. \n\nYet fond memories of Winterfell are not why Jon has forsaken his vows. He is [[Eddard Stark|his father]]\xe2\x80\x99s son and [[Robb Stark|Robb]]\'s brother. Maester [[Aemon Targaryen (son of Maekar I)|Aemon]] was right about the pain of choosing, but [[Tyrion Lannister]] was also right about denying a hard truth. Jon is done with denying the truth. For the rest of his life, he will be accursed and outcast but it will be worth it so long as he lives long enough to join Robb in avenging their father. Jon even envisions the moment he will reveal himself to Robb. Yet those visions stall at Robb\xe2\x80\x99s reaction, when Jon cannot picture his brother smiling. Jon\xe2\x80\x99s mind flashes to the deserter that their father beheaded and to what his father told the deserter about vows. He wonders what his father\xe2\x80\x99s reaction might have been if that deserter had been his brother [[Benjen Stark|Benjen]]; he thinks it must be different. The thought of being rejected and executed does not bear thinking about, so Jon begins riding harder again, as if to outrun his doubts. He does not fear death, but he does not want to die like that. He is not a true Stark but he can die like one; let them say there were four sons.\n\nAs Jon approaches the lights of [[Mole\'s Town]], [[Ghost]] disappears, apparently to go hunting. Jon does not concern himself, knowing the [[direwolf]] will follow at his own pace. Once he is well beyond the village, Jon stops to drink runoff from the snow and finds his fingers ache worse than they have in days and he has a pounding headache. Since his horse is lathered, he walks. Jon still has not seen his wolf and it concerns him. He decides to eat a sparse meal to give Ghost a chance to catch up. As he is finishing, Jon hears horses coming from the north. Knowing they are too close to outrun, Jon quickly takes cover with the horse in a grove of [[sentinel]] trees off the road.\n\nAs the riders ride up, Jon quickly recognizes the voices of the boys of his former training syndicate: [[Grenn]], [[Pypar|Pyp]], [[Todder|Toad]], [[Halder]], and [[Matthar]]. Jon\xe2\x80\x99s mare snorts, and Halder hears it as the others argue about where Jon might be, and asks the others to be quiet. Jon realizes that Sam did not go to the Lord Commander but he did not go to sleep, either. Jon is concerned that the other boys will be named deserters if they are not in their beds by dawn. Just as the boys are about to pass him by, Ghost comes loping through the woods and spooks Jon\xe2\x80\x99s horse, giving away his position.\n\nJon first tries to flee but the boys are on him before he can. He draws his sword and attempts to frighten them into backing down, but the boys are unafraid. Jon demands to know what they want and they explain they are here to take him back where he belongs. Jon insists that he belongs with his brother Robb, but the others remind him that \'\'they\'\' are his brothers now. Jon wonders why they cannot leave him in peace. They start reciting their vows, Jon cursing them. Pyp moves his horse closer, and the others surround him. Pyp grabs the reins and tells Jon that he must either come back with them or kill them. Jon knows can easily kill them all, but agrees to go back, cursing them all. Ghost comes out of the trees and Jon glares at him, but Ghost\xe2\x80\x99s eyes seem to have a knowing look. Pyp notes that they have to hurry because they must be back before first light, otherwise the Lord Commander will have all their heads. They make it back an hour before dawn. To Jon it no longer seems like home and he decides he will bide his time before his next attempt and avoid the kingsroad next time. \n\nThe next morning as Jon is serving his breakfast, the Lord Commander reminds Jon of his comment that the things men love destroy them and that the hard truths are the ones to hold tight. Then he comments that Jon looks weary and asks if his moonlight ride was exhausting. When Jon expresses his surprise, Mormont explains that Maester Aemon told him that Jon would leave, and that he told Aemon that Jon would come back. He adds that he knew honor would bring Jon back. Jon points out that his friends brought him back, but Mormont replies that he did not say it was Jon\xe2\x80\x99s honor. He then tells Jon that he had a watch put over him, and that if his friends had not brought him back, he would have been taken anyway. \n\nJon thinks his life is forfeit and declares he is not afraid to die. Mormont says he hopes Jon is not afraid to live either, pointing out that if they beheaded every man who rode to Mole\xe2\x80\x99s Town for the night only ghosts would guard the Wall. Mormont also notes that Jon is plotting to desert again. When Jon keeps silent, Mormont asks if he thinks he can actually bring his father back to life or make any difference to Robb\xe2\x80\x99s war; each of Robb\xe2\x80\x99s bannermen command more swords than the entire Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch. \n\nMormont goes so far as to point out that his own sister, [[Maege Mormont|Maege]], and her daughters rode south with Robb, but that his place is the Wall. Mormont asks where Jon believes his place is. Jon thinks that he has no place, no mother, and now no father, but only says he does not know. Mormont says that he knows Jon\xe2\x80\x99s place. The cold winds are rising: [[Cotter Pyke]]\xe2\x80\x99s men have reported [[Mammoth|mammoths]] and [[Giants|huge misshapen tracks]] near [[Eastwatch-by-the-sea|Eastwatch]]. [[Denys Mallister]] has reported that the [[Free Folk|wildlings]] are abandoning their villages near the [[Shadow Tower]] and [[Qhorin Halfhand]] has taken a captive who revealed that [[Mance Rayder]], the [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]], is massing his people in some secret stronghold for an unknown purpose. Then the Lord Commander asks if Jon thinks his brother\xe2\x80\x99s war is more important than theirs is. He also asks Jon if he thinks it matters who sits the [[Iron Throne]] when [[Wights|dead men]] come hunting in the night. Jon has to agree; he has never thought of it that way before.\n\nMormont goes on to say that he believes Jon and Ghost were meant to be here, because the blood of the [[First Men]], who built the Wall, is strong in the [[House Stark|Starks]] of Winterfell; they remember things other men have forgotten. In addition, Ghost led them to the two wights. Some men, like Ser [[Jaremy Rykker]], might call that happenstance, but Mormont stresses that Ser Jaremy is dead and he is alive. He wants Jon and Ghost with him when they go [[beyond the Wall]]; he wants to find [[Benjen Stark]], alive or dead.\n\nWhen Jon asks what he means, Mormont declares that he will not sit meekly and wait for the snows to come. The Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch will [[The Great Ranging|ride in force]] against the wildlings, [[the Others]], and whatever else is out there. Mormont plans to command them himself. He continues that the Lord Commander\xe2\x80\x99s steward also serves as his squire, but he does not want to be looking over his shoulder. Therefore, he asks Jon: \n\n{{Quote|\'\' Are you a brother of the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch or only a bastard boy who wants to play at war?|}}\n\nJon pauses to apologize mentally to all his family before declaring that he is Mormont\xe2\x80\x99s man and that he will not run again. Mormont expresses his approval and orders Jon to go put on [[Longclaw|his sword]] again.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/11/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-33 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2009/09/tyrion-jon.html Humorous analyses of the chapter] by Jason.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/071/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 70]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Jon Snow]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Castle Black]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Mole\'s Town]]\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 70]]\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 71, Jon]]\n[[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\x94\xd0\xb6\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbd IX]]</text>\n      <sha1>nhzy6ajcriie05udtr7rmix15e0ijde</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Game of Thrones-Chapter 68</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6041</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166010</id>\n      <parentid>117158</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-17T14:58:47Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8356">{{Infobox Chapter AGoT\n| pov\t\t= [[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n| place         = [[Dothraki Sea]]\n| title\t\t= Daenerys IX\n| page\t\t= 628\n| previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 67|Sansa VI]]\n| current\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 68|Daenerys IX]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 69|Tyrion IX]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 64|Daenerys VIII]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 72|Daenerys X]]\n}} __NOTOC__\n    \n[[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] has terrible nightmares during her long recovery. She wakes to learn that [[Rhaego|her child]] was born dead, a twisted monstrosity. When she visits with Drogo he is comatose, but [[Mirri Maz Duur]] insist that he is alive. Daenerys is horrified by the cost of the bloodmagic. That night, she attempts to revive Drogo, but by morning knows he is gone forever and smothers him with a pillow.\n\n==Synopsis==    \nIn her dreams, [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] keeps hearing, \'\'\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not want to wake the dragon, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\'\' She is walking down a hall, her bare feet leaving bloody footprints. Suddenly she is with [[Drogo]] under the open sky of the [[Dothraki Sea]]. Drogo is stroking her, waking her passion, and when he enters her the stars are gone, great wings fill the sky, and the world takes flame. Then she sees Ser [[Jorah Mormont|Jorah\xe2\x80\x99s]] drawn and sorrowful face telling her that the last dragon was [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] while standing over a hot brazier containing red-hot stone eggs. In turn, he is replaced by [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]] with his molten gold crown screaming \'\'\xe2\x80\x9cThe dragon does not beg, slut,\xe2\x80\x9d\'\' and \'\'\xe2\x80\x9cI will be crowned.\xe2\x80\x9d\'\' Then he painfully pinches her nipples and suddenly Daenerys is frantically running to a distant [[red door]] that is her salvation. She knows that the darkness is there, but she does not dare look back or she will be lost. She sees [[Rhaego|her son]] as a grown warrior, proud and tall, before flames consume him. Then the [[House Targaryen|ghosts of kings]] are lining the hallway urging her to go faster. Then she is flying over the [[Dothraki Sea]], and all are fleeing before her. She finally throws open the red door to see her brother Rhaegar, the last dragon, in his armor, but when she opens his visor she sees her own face. \n\nDaenerys wakes to the taste of ashes, with [[Jhiqui]] standing over her. Her body hurts very much. She calls for something, but does not know what. Jhiqui says \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d and bolts from the tent shouting. When they return, Daenerys is crawling toward her dragon eggs. Ser Jorah carries her back to bed and tells her to sleep and then [[Mirri Maz Duur]] gives her something in a cup. A dreamless sleep takes her.\n\nIt is dark when Daenerys wakes again. She calls for her handmaidens and they attend to her. They tell her that she has been sick for a long time. Then Mirri Maz Duur gives her wine and as she falls asleep, asking for a dragon\xe2\x80\x99s egg. The next time she wakes, Daenerys has the pale dragon\xe2\x80\x99s egg in her arms and it is warm. There is fine sheen of perspiration on her that she names \xe2\x80\x9cdragon\xe2\x80\x99s dew.\xe2\x80\x9d There is no fever and she feels strong. She calls for her handmaidens and asks for a bath, Mirri Maz Duur, Ser Jorah, Drogo, and her child. Her handmaids avoid answering about Drogo and her child, and Daenerys knows that her child is dead. \n\nMirri Maz Duur and Ser Jorah enter to find Daenerys standing over the other eggs, which are all warm. However, when asked, Ser Jorah does not feel the heat from the eggs. Ser Jorah looks gaunt and limps from his wounds. He tells Daenerys that her son never lived, but Mirri Maz Duur tells her that the child was monstrous: lizard-like, with scales; his skin fell off, revealing a body filled with grave worms and the stink of corruption, as if he had been dead for years. She states that her son was strong when Ser Jorah brought her into the tent. Mirri Maz Duur explains that death was in the tent and that the shadows touched her. \n\nDaenerys realizes that Ser Jorah killed her child by taking her into the tent, for love and loyalty to her. Daenerys states that she thought the life of the horse would be payment enough and is told that was a lie she told herself. Daenerys is not sure if she knew. Daenerys realizes that the life of the horse, her son, [[Quaro]], [[Qotho]], [[Haggo]], and [[Cohollo]] paid for the life of Drogo. She asks to see what the price bought. Ser Jorah cannot dissuade her and has to help her stand since she is weaker than she thought.\n\nOutside, in the glaring sun, Daenerys can see there is little left: a scattering of tents, a few score of horses, and perhaps a hundred people. They are the old, the frightened, and the sick. [[Jhogo]] reminds her that a \'\'[[khal]]\'\' who cannot ride is no \'\'khal\'\'. She learns that \'\'[[Ko]]\'\' [[Pono]] declared himself \'\'khal\'\' first, and [[Jhaqo]] after him. They took most of the riders, the herds, and the slaves because Daenerys\xe2\x80\x99 own \'\'[[khas]]\'\' was too weak to stop them; it is the right of the strong to take from the weak. Most of the rest left during the following nights. [[Mago]], now a [[bloodrider]] to Khal Jhaqo, seized [[Eroeh]] (whom Daenerys had denied him) and raped and murdered her. Daenerys repeats her mantra, \xe2\x80\x9cIf I look back I am lost,\xe2\x80\x9d and swears that Mago and Jhaqo will die screaming. Irri warns her that Jhaqo now has 20,000 riders, but Daenerys insists that she is [[House Targaryen|the blood of the dragon]]. Then she asks to see Drogo.\n\nDrogo lies unmoving, unseeing, and covered in [[bloodflies]]. Daenerys asks why he is outside alone and Ser Jorah explains that he seems to like the warmth and staring at the sun with eyes that cannot see. He will follow where led and eat if food is put in his mouth, but otherwise does nothing. Daenerys faces Mirri Maz Duur, who insists that Drogo \'\'is\'\' alive. Daenerys responds that such is not life for a man that was as alive as Drogo. Then Daenerys asks Mirri Maz Duur when Drogo will be as he was. The \'\'maegi\'\' replies, {{Quote|\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the sun rises in the west and sets in the east. When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before.\xe2\x80\x9d}}\n\n[[File: MagaliVilleneuve_DaenerysT.jpg\xe2\x80\x8e|Daenerys goes to put an end to Drogo - by Magali Villeneuve. \xc2\xa9 Fantasy Flight Games|thumb|right|300px]]\n\nDaenerys sends the others away and then accuses Mirri Maz Duur of knowing, of cheating her and murdering her child. Mirri Maz Duur replies that it was wrong of the \'\'khalasar\'\' to burn her temple, and now the [[Stallion Who Mounts the World]] will burn no cities and trample no nations. Daenerys reminds the \'\'maegi\'\' that she saved her, but Mirri Maz Duur asks what Daenerys saved when three warriors had already raped her, burned her home and her temple, and cut off the heads of her neighbors and friends. Daenerys insists that she saved her life, but the \'\'maegi\'\' tells her to look at her \'\'khal\'\' and see what life is worth when all else is gone. Daenerys orders her men to bind Mirri Maz Duur and take her away; the woman only smiles at her.\n\nDaenerys orders Drogo brought into her tent. She bathes him herself and washes his hair until darkness falls. She thinks of their first ride beneath the open sky and of when they made [[Rhaego]]. She is too raw from the miscarriage for intercourse, but uses other means in an attempt to use the magic of love to bring Drogo back. It does not work and her husband remains comatose. When dawn breaks, Daenerys kisses Drogo for the last time, and then smothers him with a soft silk pillow.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/11/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-32 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2009/08/arya-bran.html Humorous review of the chapter]\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/069/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 68]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Daenerys Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in the Dothraki Sea]]\n\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 68]]\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 69, Daenerys]]\n[[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\x94\xd1\x8d\xd0\xb9\xd0\xbd\xd0\xb5\xd1\x80\xd0\xb8\xd1\x81 IX]]</text>\n      <sha1>iez9pxyq0i71lqk9zxuoglvbiol8e6r</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 80</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6260</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>122070</id>\n      <parentid>98499</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2014-03-30T15:13:26Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Scafloc</username>\n        <id>28</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3767">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]]\n| title\t\t= Sansa VII\n| place         = the [[Eyrie]]\n| page\t\t= 900\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 79|Jon XII]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 80|Sansa VII]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Epilogue|Epilogue]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 68|Sansa VI]]\n| arc next\t=\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:MKomarck SansaEyrie.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Sansa making a snow castle by [http://www.komarckart.com/ M.Kormack]]]\nAt the [[Eyrie]], [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] awakens to find it snowing outside. She wanders outside and begins to sculpt a snow castle, slowly forming it into a replica of [[Winterfell]]. [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] finds her in the garden and helps her finish the castle. He tells her she is even more beautiful than [[Catelyn Tully|her mother]] was at her age, and then proceeds to kiss her. Sansa is shocked by Lord Baelish\xe2\x80\x99s action, but for half a heartbeat she yields. She tries to make him stop and then young [[Robert Arryn|Robert]] approaches interrupting them.  Robert begins to destroy the snow castle with his ragged doll. Sansa reacts by grabbing the doll which causes it to tear in half.  This in turn causes her cousin to begin shaking violently. Maester [[Colemon]] is called to bring the boy for a leeching, in an attempt to cure the fit. \n\nSansa is brought before her aunt, but [[Lysa Arryn|Lysa]] is not concerned about her son\xe2\x80\x99s seizure, but rather Sansa kissing Petyr. Lysa accuses her of trying to seduce her husband, just like her mother had tried to &quot;steal&quot; Petyr from her. Lady Arryn then relates the story of how one night when they had all gotten drunk, Catelyn spurned Littlefinger, and Lysa had gone to his bed afterward to comfort him, even though he had called her Cat. Lysa continues to rant about how [[Hoster Tully|her father]] took their baby away from them, and then grabs Sansa and drags her before the [[Eyrie#Moon Door|Moon Door]] while calling for [[Marillion]]. Lysa pushes her closer and closer to the edge, until Littlefinger arrives and tells his new wife to release her. \n\nLysa, bordering on insanity, reveals how she had persuaded [[Jon Arryn]] to get Littlefinger his first post, and how she had done as he said when Petyr told her to put the [[Tears of Lys]] in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s wine. He also had her write the letter to her sister falsely naming the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] as Jon Arryn\xe2\x80\x99s murderers. Petyr promises never to leave her side again, and as she falls into his arms, he tells her he has only ever loved one woman... Cat.  He then shoves her out the Moon Door. He calls for the guards, accusing Marillion of killing his wife\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Sansa Stark]]\n*[[Petyr Baelish]] Littlefinger\n*[[Catelyn Tully]]\n*[[Robert Arryn]]\n*[[Colemon]]\n*[[Lysa Arryn]] \n*[[Hoster Tully]]\n*[[Marillion]]\n*[[Jon Arryn]]\n}}\t\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Eyrie]]\n*[[Winterfell]]\n*[[Eyrie#Moon Door|Moon Door]]\n*[[Tears of Lys]]\n*[[House Lannister]]\n}}\n\n\n==References and Notes==\n* The synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/11/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-52 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Part 52].

She knows that open battle will cost her many lives, even though her commanders feel she will win easily. Daenerys tells her men to invite the two sellsword Captains, as well as the Yunkish leader. The first to arrive are the three Captains of the [[Stormcrows]], who spurn her offer to join her, although she notices [[Daario Naharis]] smile at her as they leave. The Captain of the [[Second Sons]] also laughs at her offer, but does accept a wagonload of wine to bring to his men. The master slaver brings Daenerys chests full of gold hoping she will leave Yunkai alone, but she sends him off with his gold and a warning that she will attack in three days time. \n\nAfter he leaves, Daenerys tells her commanders that they will attack that night, since none of Yunkai\xe2\x80\x99s defenders will be expecting it. Soon after, Daario returns with the heads of the other two Stormcrow Captains, and swears the service of his company. [[Jorah Mormont|Jorah]] warns her not to trust the [[Tyrosh|Tyroshi]], yet she commands the battle to commence as planned. During the fight, she asks [[Barristan Selmy|Arstan]] to tell her more of her brother [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]]. Whitebeard explains that the Prince was always melancholy, and a sense of doom hung over him. &quot;He was born in grief, and that shadow hung over him all his days.&quot; Daenerys knows that it was the shadow of [[Summerhall]] that Arstan was referring to. Word arrives that her army won the battle easily during the night, with the help of the Stormcrows, and all the Second Sons too drunk to fight. Daenerys commands her men to spare any who threw down their swords, and promised to free any slaves. Once again, Daenerys\xe2\x80\x99 army swells to even greater size.  Daenerys rides on her white mare past all the newly freed people who call out to her as &quot;Mother!&quot;\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n*[[Daario Naharis]]\n*[[Jorah Mormont]]\n*[[Barristan Selmy|Arstan]]\n*[[Rhaegar Targaryen]]\n}}\t\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Unsullied]]\n*[[Yunkai]]\n*[[Sellsword]]\n*[[Stormcrows]]\n*[[Second Sons]]\n*[[Tyrosh|Tyroshi]]\n*[[Summerhall]]\n}}\n\n\n==References and Notes==\n*The synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/03/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-24 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Part 24].

The battle has already begun, and the dragons [[Rhaegal]] and [[Viserion]] are flying overhead. The Ironborn have arrived in Slaver\'s Bay; Tyrion can hear the clash of warships, and a fire ship has blocked the mouth of the [[Skahazadhan|Skahazadhan.]]\n\nTyrion reflects on his first [[Battle of the Green Fork|battle at the Green Fork]]. He remembers this battle more clearly than the [[Battle of the Blackwater]].\nThe Second Sons are preparing themselves for battle, and Tyrion is reminded of [[Bronn]] when he observes [[Snatch]] scratching himself and making jokes. Despite his previous assertions that he did not care whether he lived or died, Tyrion has come to realise that he does care.\n\nBack in the tent, Penny is arming herself for the battle too. [[Penny]] helps him with his own armour, as he reveals the foolish strategy of the current Yunkish Supreme Commander. While reminiscing about the Battle of the Green Fork, Penny kisses him. This angers Tyrion, so much so that he is prepared to kill her if he had a weapon. \nHis murderous rage is disrupted by the sounds of Rhaegal circling over the bay, while ships are clashing. Viserion has the attention of the Sellswords as he roasts and consumes the corpses being thrown by the Wicked Sister. \nA messenger arrives from the Supreme Commander of the Yunkai\'i, [[Gorzhak zo Eraz]]. He demands that [[Brown Ben Plumm]] bring his company to the Bay shore to defend the Slaver ships. [[Inkpots]] points out that Brown Ben is with [[Malazza]], the Girl General and he is the only one who can command the Second Sons. The messenger departs, and Tyrion and [[Jorah Mormont]] attempt to persuade the sellswords to turn their cloaks again. Brown Ben returns and calls a meeting with his captains, which Tyrion and Jorah attend. Malazza has commanded the Second Sons to defend Wicked Sister. [[Barristan Selmy]] is making for the Harridan and [[Marselen|Marselen\'s]] freedmen have defeated the Long Lances, destroying the Ghost in the process. \n\nAnother messenger from [[Morghar zo Zherzyn]] arrives to inform the Second Sons that [[Bloodbeard]] and two Ghiscari legions are defending the Harpy\'s Daughter from the advancing Unsullied. The Second Sons are to sweep behind and take the Unsullied in the rear. Zheryn is the new Supreme Commander, Gorzhak having been slain by the [[Tattered Prince|Prince of Tatters]]; the Windblown have turned their cloaks. The messenger recognises Tyrion as an escaped slave of Yezzan zo Qaggaz and orders the Second Sons to surrender him. Jorah responds to this by killing the messenger. He falls on the cyvasse table, knocking the white dragon to the floor, which Tyrion picks up. Brown Ben Plumm declares that they have always been Queen\'s men, and joining the Yunkai\'i was just a ploy.&lt;ref&gt;\'\'[[The Winds of Winter]]\'\', Tyrion\'s sample chapter, made available in \'\'[[A World of Ice and Fire]]\'\' as of March 21, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n{{Columns|2|\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Second Sons]]\n*[[Windblown]]\n*[[Bokkoko]]\n*[[Garibald]]\n*[[Kem]]\n*[[Hammer]]\n*[[Nail]]\n*[[Snatch]]\n*[[Penny]]\n*[[Rhaegal]]\n*[[Inkpots]]\n*[[Gorzhak zo Eraz]]\'s messenger\n*[[Jorah Mormont]]\n*[[Viserion]]\n*[[Brown Ben Plumm]]\n*[[Kasporio the Cunning]]\n*[[Uhlan]]\n*[[Morghaz zo Zherzyn]]\'s messenger\n\n}}\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n{{Columns|2|\n*[[Shae]]\n*[[Podrick Payne]]\n*[[Oppo|Groat]]\n*[[Bronn]]\n*[[Cersei Lannister]]\n*[[Pretty Pig]]\n*[[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n*[[Gorzhak zo Eraz]] (Pudding Face)\n*[[Unsullied]]\n*[[Company of the Cat]]\n*[[Tywin Lannister]]\n*[[Barristan Selmy]]\n*[[Malazza]] (The Girl General)\n*[[Faezhar zo Faez]] (The Rabbit)\n*[[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n*Hostages of the Yunkish ([[Jhogo]], [[Daario Naharis]])\n*[[Marselen]]\n*[[Mother\'s Men]]\n*[[Long Lances]]\n*[[Bloodbeard]]\n*[[Morghaz zo Zherzyn]] (The Drunken Conqueror)\n*[[Yezzan zo Qaggaz]]\n*[[Tattered Prince]]\n}}\n|}\n\n==Places and Terms Mentioned==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n{{Columns|2|\n*[[Meereen]]\n*[[Slaver\'s Bay]]\n*[[Skahazadhan]]\n*[[Qarth]]\n*[[Yunkai]]\n*[[King\'s Landing]]\n*[[Casterly Rock]]\n*[[Iron Islands]]\n*[[Lannisport]]\n*[[Bear Island]]\n}}\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Second siege of Meereen]]\n*[[Horse]]\n*[[Ghiscari language]]\n*[[Dragon]]\n*[[Ironborn]]\n*Qartheen\n*[[Six sisters]]\n*Slave soldier\n*[[Battle of the Green Fork]]\n*[[Battle of the Blackwater]]\n*The [[Stranger (the Seven)|Stranger]]\n*[[Pale mare]]\n*[[Eunuch]]\n*[[Wise Masters]]\n*\'\'[[Cyvasse]]\'\'\n*[[Black Goat of Qohor]]\n*[[Bakkalon]]\n*[[Him of Many Faces]]\n*[[Supreme Commander of the Armies and Allies of Yunkai]]\n*[[Westermen]]\n*[[House Mormont]]\n*[[Ghiscari legions]]\n*[[Pentos]]hi\n}}\n|}\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|The Winds of Winter: Chapter ?]]\n[[Category:A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Tyrion Lannister]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Slaver\'s Bay]]\n[[es:Vientos de Invierno-Tyrion II]]\n[[fr:The Winds of Winter, Chapitre provisoire, Tyrion 2]]</text>\n      <sha1>sezvlbptmo7ftn9bu1hxrfc5s164zl5</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Clash of Kings-Chapter 63</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5746</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166466</id>\n      <parentid>159641</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-23T21:00:49Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6243">{{Infobox Chapter ACfK\n| pov\t\t= [[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n| place         = [[Qarth]]\n| title\t\t= Daenerys V\n| page\t\t= 637\n| previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 62|Sansa VII]]\n| current\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 63|Daenerys V]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 64|Arya X]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 48|Daenerys IV]]\n| arc next\t=\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Daenerys Targaryen|Dany]] considers the defeat of the Undying to be [[Drogon]]\xe2\x80\x99s victory. However, [[Xaro Xhoan Daxos|Xaro]], whose guest she is, warns her that the [[Warlocks]] are gathering their power to come for her, and that the other two great merchant consortiums want her either expelled from [[Qarth|the city]], or killed outright. Dany realizes she must flee, for Xaro\xe2\x80\x99s protection can only go so far. The merchant again asks her to marry him, but this time Dany learns that what Xaro really wants is one of the dragons. Dany tells him that it would cost one-third of all the ships in the world in order for her to give up one of her dragons. Xaro leaves, and Dany questions Ser [[Jorah Mormont|Jorah]] about some of the mysteries she saw in the [[House of the Undying]]. Jorah says that the three heads of the dragon represent [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon]] and his two sisters, but Dany is not convinced. The knight confirms that [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]] did play a silver harp, but he says that if the [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaegar)|Prince\xe2\x80\x99s son]] was the promised one in the vision, the infant Aegon was killed during the [[sack of King\'s Landing]]. Jorah has no knowledge of the song of ice and fire.\n\nDany later sets out with the exiled knight and her bloodriders to find ships to take her from Qarth. Along the docks, Jorah warns her that a big, scarred man and an old man with a staff are following them. When a merchant hands her a beautiful box as a gift, Dany opens it to find a green scarab within. The creature within the box flies out, and mayhem erupts. The creature would have bit Dany had the old man with the staff not knocked it out of her hands. The merchant was a [[Sorrowful Men|Sorrowful Man]], and the creature a [[manticore]] that would have killed Dany had it bitten her. They learn that the huge, scarred eunuch is the pit-fighter Strong [[Belwas]], and the old man is his squire [[Barristan Selmy|Arstan Whitebeard]], both sent by Magister [[Illyrio Mopatis]] to return them to [[Pentos]]. The old man recognizes Mormont, and the exile recognizes him but cannot place a name. Arstan claims he comes from the [[Seven Kingdoms]], and squired for a knight of [[House Swann]] as a young man. The two claim that Illyrio sent for them because he wishes to have her dragons in order to bring justice to the Seven Kingdoms, which are a divided and warring realm. Dany concedes that she must leave Qarth, but commands them to change the names of their three ships to that of Aegon\xe2\x80\x99s three dragons.\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot;

They surmise that these were some of the men responsible for the [[raid on Saltpans]], probably hanged by Lord [[Beric Dondarrion|Beric]]\'s outlaw band. Reaching the inn, they meet four girls on the porch, and the oldest addresses them. She asks for silver for a night\'s lodging, stating the only visitors they get are either sparrows or robbers and worse. When Ser [[Hyle Hunt|Hyle]] makes an inquiry regarding her tone, the smith approaches and Brienne is nearly floored by his resemblance to [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]]. Inside, Brienne plans to leave before dawn with [[Podrick Payne|Podrick]] only, although she is unsure where to go. At dinner, Septon [[Meribald]] leads a prayer, but [[Gendry]] does not participate and returns to his forge. One of the orphan boys tells the septon that it is because he worships the [[Lord of Light]]. Brienne delivers some food to Gendry and mentions his resemblance to King [[Robert I Baratheon|Robert]], but they are interrupted by riders drawing near.\n \nGendry says they are friends, but when Brienne peeks out, she recognizes [[Biter]] among the seven men. The leader, wearing the helm of [[Sandor Clegane]], threatens to kill [[Willow Heddle|Willow]] if she fires her crossbow. Brienne draws [[Oathkeeper]] and intercedes. One of the men says that they are wounded and seek only fresh horses, for they are being chased by outlaws. But the large man wearing the [[Hound]]\'s helm charges Brienne, remembering her well. She makes short work of him, running him through with Oathkeeper, and she whispers &quot;Sapphires&quot; as [[Rorge]] dies. But she is blindsided by Biter, who tackles her to the ground. The huge cannibal smashes her in the face, breaking bones, and then shatters her forearm. She hears the sounds of swords clashing in the background, but then Biter takes a bite out of her face. Her last vision is Biter\'s tongue sticking out, obscenely long, almost like it were a sword...\n\n==References and Notes== \n*The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/08/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-feast-for-crows-part-27 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Feast for Crows, Part 27].

[[Qhorin Halfhand|Qhorin]] sends [[Ebben]] back with the last garron to reach the [[Jeor Mormont|Lord Commander]] with all haste, while the rest try to head off pursuit. Watched by the eagle, Qhorin then sends [[Stonesnake]] back as well, to take the high passes to reach the [[Fist of the First Men]]. Qhorin commands Stonesnake to tell Mormont all that [[Jon Snow|Jon]] saw: that he faces giants and wargs and worse, and that the trees have eyes again. That night, the Halfhand asks Jon if his sword is sharp, and makes the young man recite his oath with him. Qhorin then commands Jon to yield when they are overtaken, and not to balk no matter what the wildlings ask him to do to prove himself. Jon is appalled at the suggestion, but Qhorin tells him to go among the [[Wildlings]] and learn what they plan, watch what they do, but to remember who he is and to return to Mormont when he has learned what the wildlings are searching for. Qhorin promises to tell the Lord Commander that Jon never broke his oath when he sees him again.\n\nThey are overtaken soon after by [[Rattleshirt]] and a party of wildlings, [[Ygritte]] amongst them. They have Ebben\xe2\x80\x99s head, and Rattleshirt orders them killed.

[[Sandor Clegane|The Hound]] wins the [[Tourney of the Hand|tourney]] when he saves the life of the [[Loras Tyrell|Knight of Flowers]]. Later, [[Varys]] visits Ned to reveal that Robert was meant to die in the melee.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:Dennis Chan men of honour.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[Eddard Stark|Ned]] and Ser [[Barristan Selmy|Barristan]] view the body of Ser Hugh. \xc2\xa9 FFG]]\n\n[[Eddard Stark|Ned]] and Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] see that Ser [[Hugh]] is taken by the [[Faith of the Seven#silent sisters|silent sisters]]. Barristan Selmy explains that he stood vigil for the fallen knight himself, as the boy had no one else except a mother far away in the [[Vale of Arryn]]. Ser Hugh had been Lord [[Jon Arryn]]\xe2\x80\x99s squire for four years and had been knighted by King [[Robert Baratheon]] after Jon Arryn\xe2\x80\x99s death. Ned wonders if the boy was killed on purpose by a [[House Lannister|Lannister]] bannerman to prevent Ned from interviewing him.\n\nSer Hugh\xe2\x80\x99s armor is new, forged especially for the tourney, and worth good money. Ser Barristan does not know if Ser Hugh had even finished paying the smith. Ned replies that the boy paid dearly, and orders the silent sisters to have the armor sent to the boy\xe2\x80\x99s mother. Ser Barristan continues to walk with Ned and informs him that King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] intends to fight in the melee. Ned already knows. When Ser Barristan suggests that drunken words are often forgotten in the morning, Ned insists that Robert will remember. \n\nAs they approach the king\xe2\x80\x99s pavilion, they hear Robert raging at his squires, [[Tyrek Lannister|Tyrek]] and [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]]. When they enter the tent, Robert complains that his squires cannot even put a man\xe2\x80\x99s armor on him properly, but Ned tells him the boys are not at fault\xe2\x80\x94Robert is too fat for his armor. Robert tells Ned in mock anger that he should not call his king fat, and then sends the two squires off to get a breastplate stretcher from Ser [[Aron Santagar]]. After the squires run out, Robert and Ser Barristan laugh and even Ned smiles at the thought of the boys asking for the non-existent device.\n\nNed asks if the two squires are from [[House Lannister]]. The king admits they are, and Ned notes to himself that there are too many Lannisters around the king. Putting the thought aside, Ned asks about the angry words between the king and his wife. Robert takes this opportunity to complain about [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]]\xe2\x80\x99s audacity in telling him he should not participate in the melee, and he claims [[Lyanna Stark]] would not have done such a thing. Ned insists Robert did not really know Lyanna, and that she would have told him he had no business fighting in the melee. This does not dissuade Robert, who insists that\xe2\x80\x94unlike Ned\xe2\x80\x94he still has juices running in his veins. When Ser Barristan speaks up to explain that no man would dare to strike a king during the melee, Robert is furious and sends Ser Barristan away, but orders Ned to stay and to drink.\n\nRobert laments to Ned that he was never so alive as when he was winning the throne or so dead as after it was won. He declares that Ned or Jon Arryn should have been the king, but Ned reminds Robert that he had the best claim. The king declares that he had not wanted to marry after Lyanna\xe2\x80\x99s death and that it was [[Jon Arryn]] who recommended Cersei Lannister. Robert admits that Cersei is beautiful, but insists that she is cold and that Jon Arryn was a fool for recommending the marriage; Robert only agreed to it so he\'d have the wealth and might of [[Tywin Lannister]] on his side should [[Viserys Targaryen]] ever return to claim the throne.\n\nRobert also apologizes to Ned for the death of Sansa\xe2\x80\x99s [[direwolf]], admitting that he is sure [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] lied regarding the [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 15|incident]]. He continues that he dreams of giving up the crown and becoming a [[sellsword]] in the [[Free Cities]], but the thought of Joffrey on the throne with Cersei whispering in his ear stops him. Robert asks Ned how he could have made a son like Joffrey. Ned responds hollowly that Joffrey is only a boy and that Jon Arryn often despaired of Robert himself when he was a child. Robert admits this to be true and claims that he turned into a good king. When Ned does not respond, Robert declares that Ned could at least say he is a better king than [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys]]. Ned admits the truth in that. Robert insists that he and Ned still have many years yet to set things right and make him a good ruler.\n\nChanging the subject, Robert asks who Ned believes will win the joust. Robert comments that the [[Loras Tyrell|Knight of Flowers]] is a son to be proud of and regales Ned with the story of when the young knight unhorsed [[Jaime Lannister]] in a previous tourney. Then the king mentions that [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]] has told him about the Knight of Flowers\xe2\x80\x99 lovely, fourteen-year-old sister [[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]].\n\nDuring breakfast, Robert talks with Ned about when they were boys. The stories bring a smile to Ned, who realizes he is speaking to the Robert he grew up with and if he can prove his accusations this man will listen. The thought of the downfall of Cersei and Jaime even makes the food taste better, and Ned feels better than he has in a long time. \n\nNed arrives at the tourney and sits by his daughter [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]]. In the first joust, [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] bets against [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]] since a dog will not bite the hand that feeds it. He loses the bet when the Hound defeats Ser Jaime on the second pass after almost losing in the first. Sansa tells Ned that she knew the Hound would win, and Littlefinger asks her to tell him who will win the second match.\n\nBy the time they lead Ser Jaime\xe2\x80\x94who can no longer see through his mangled helm\xe2\x80\x94off the field, Ser [[Gregor Clegane]] is in position. He is the biggest man Ned has ever seen, even dwarfing [[Hodor]]. Ned recalls Gregor as a man of ominous reputation; supposedly he dashed in the skull of the infant [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaegar)|Aegon Targaryen]] and boasted that he raped and murdered the boy\xe2\x80\x99s mother Princess [[Elia Martell|Elia]] afterwards. There are also rumors of queer circumstances surrounding the deaths of two wives, a sister, his father, and the burning of his brother\xe2\x80\x99s face.\n\nClegane\xe2\x80\x99s opponent is the slim and elegantly armored Knight of Flowers, Ser Loras Tyrell, who wears a cape of woven flowers. After comparing Ser Loras and his opponent, Sansa asks her father to ensure that Ser Loras is not hurt. Ned assures her that the lances are designed to break to prevent injury, but cannot help but think of Ser Hugh. \n\nSer Gregor has tremendous difficulty controlling his stallion, while Loras demonstrates his horsemanship on his mare. When the pass begins, Clegane\xe2\x80\x99s mount breaks into a hard gallop immediately, while Ser Loras\xe2\x80\x99 mare charges smoothly. They meet while Gregor is still struggling with his mount, shield, and lance. Ser Loras\' lance strikes Gregor perfectly, sending him down with his mount. Ser Loras\xe2\x80\x99 lance is not even broken, and the crowd cheers when he raises his visor in victory.\n\n[[File:T Jedruszek Gregor v Hound.jpg|thumb|350px|left|The Hound vs. the Mountain -- \xc2\xa9 FFG]]\n\nGregor gets up in a rage, demands his sword, and nearly beheads his horse with a single blow. He then strides toward Ser Loras and sends the Knight of Flowers to the ground with his first blow. He is about to deliver a killing blow when the Hound intercedes. Gregor sends multiple sword blows toward his brother\xe2\x80\x99s head, but the Hound stops each one, remaining on the defensive. The Hound drops to his knee when he hears the King\xe2\x80\x99s voice over the crowd. The blow from Gregor passes through air, and finally Gregor comes to his senses, drops his sword, glares at King Robert, and storms off. In gratitude, Ser Loras forfeits the championship to the Hound, so there is no final joust. The crowd cheers for the Hound for the first time in his life. \n\nAs they head towards the archery field, Littlefinger points out that Ser Loras had to know his mare was in heat and that such a thing would disrupt Ser Gregor\xe2\x80\x99s stallion. A boy named [[Anguy]] wins the archery event, and Ned sends [[Alyn]] to offer him a position among his guards, but the boy refuses. [[Thoros of Myr]], who fights with a flaming sword, wins the melee that starts with nearly 40 men and lasts three hours. When the list of injuries is reported, Ned is pleased that Robert did not take part.\n\nThat night at the feast, Ned remains more hopeful than he has been in a long while. Robert is in a good humor, the Lannisters are nowhere in sight, and even his daughters are behaving. Sansa speaks to [[Arya Stark|Arya]] pleasantly and even asks how her dancing has gone. Arya happily explains that she is sore all over and shows a nasty bruise on her leg. Sansa declares that Arya must be a terrible dancer. \n\nLater, Ned examines Arya\xe2\x80\x99s bruise himself while she stands on one leg, at which she has improved. He asks if [[Syrio Forel]] is being too hard on her, but Arya replies that every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better. Ned is concerned, even though Syrio came with an excellent reputation and the [[Braavos|Braavosi]]-style suits Arya\xe2\x80\x99s slim blade. He recalls finding Arya wandering the castle blindfolded because Syrio was teaching her to see with her ears, nose, and skin. Arya has also been practicing spins and back-flips. Ned offers to have someone else take over her lessons, but Arya insists she wants Syrio. Ned knows that any decent master-at-arms could give Arya the basics of sword fighting without the blindfolds, cartwheels, and hopping around on one leg, but he also knows there is no use arguing with Arya.\n\nNed returns to his solar, thinking of what he has learned. He takes out the dagger and wonders why [[Tyrion Lannister]], or anyone else, would want [[Bran Stark|Bran]] dead. He is sure that Bran\xe2\x80\x99s fall is somehow linked to the death of [[Jon Arryn]], but the truth eludes him. [[Jory Cassel|Jory]] is still in the process of searching the whorehouses, and Ned is sure [[Gendry]] is a bastard son of Robert. There is also [[Edric Storm]], a bastard Robert was forced to recognize because [[Delena Florent|his mother]] was highborn. He also remembers Robert\xe2\x80\x99s [[Mya Stone|first child]] from when Robert was still a boy himself. Yet no bastard can threaten Robert\xe2\x80\x99s trueborn children, since bastards have few inheritance rights. \n\nA knock at the door brings a stranger, who turns out to be [[Varys]] in disguise. Ned is amazed; he has never seen Varys wear anything but silk, velvet, and perfume yet now the eunuch wears coarse-spun clothes, mud-caked boots, and smells of sweat. Ned exclaims that he would never have recognized Varys. The eunuch says this is good because he would rather the queen\xe2\x80\x99s spies not know about their meeting either.\n\n[[File:Mike Capprotti Whisper Campaign.JPG|thumb|400px|right|Varys and Ned Stark - \xc2\xa9 FFG]]\n\nVarys reveals to Ned that the Lannisters had hoped to kill Robert during the melee. When Ned asks why Cersei would forbid Robert to compete if she planned to have him killed, Varys points out that the surest way to make Robert compete would be to forbid it. Ned is furious that Varys did not tell him, but soon admits that he would have gone straight to Robert, who would have fought to show his enemies he did not fear them. \n\nVarys explains to Ned that there are two sorts of people in the [[Red Keep]]: those loyal to the realm and those loyal to only to themselves. Varys says he now knows Ned to be loyal to the realm because he dissuaded the king from entering the melee. Varys also reveals that Cersei fears Ned because Robert will never harm him, not even at her command, whereas Robert would execute Varys in a twinkling at queen\xe2\x80\x99s request since the king has little love for sneaks, spies, and eunuchs.\n\nNed argues that Robert must have other friends and that his brothers are surely loyal. Varys replies that hating the queen and loving the king are not quite the same thing. Varys goes on to say that Ser Barristan loves his honor, [[Grand Maester]] [[Pycelle]] loves his office, and Littlefinger loves Littlefinger. Varys adds that the Kingsguard are a paper shield: Ser [[Boros Blount]] and Ser [[Meryn Trant]] are the queen\xe2\x80\x99s men, Ser Barristan is old, and the loyalties of the rest are also suspect. Ned insists that they must warn Robert, but Varys reminds him that without proof they will only lose. Ned insists that the plotters will try again, and Varys agrees, stating that together they might be able to stop them.\n\nAs he rises to leave, Varys reminds Ned to continue treating him with his accustomed contempt. As Varys reaches the door, Ned asks how Jon Arryn died. Varys tells him that a rare and costly poison called the [[Tears of Lys]] was used. Varys goes on to say that he suggested a taster, but Lord Arryn refused. When Ned asks who administered the poison, Varys claims that it was probably his squire, Ser [[Hugh]], who now lies dead. After [[Lysa Arryn|Lysa]] left for the [[Eyrie]], Hugh remained and had the money to buy new armor.\n\nAs a final question, Ned asks Varys what Jon Arryn had been doing that led to his murder. Varys replies, &quot;Asking questions.&quot;\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/07/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-15 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/031/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 30]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Eddard Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in King\'s Landing]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 30]]\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 31, Eddard]]\n[[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\xad\xd0\xb4\xd0\xb4\xd0\xb0\xd1\x80\xd0\xb4 VII]]</text>\n      <sha1>heob7kr0pmonyfh82p1siu1p5o6tmq0</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Feast for Crows-Chapter 29</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5723</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>142447</id>\n      <parentid>98595</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2014-09-22T20:24:22Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Scafloc</username>\n        <id>28</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <comment>/* References and Notes */</comment>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3597">{{Infobox Chapter AFfC\n| pov\t\t= [[Victarion Greyjoy]]\n| title\t\t= The Reaver\n| place         = [[Shield Islands]] - [[Lord Hewett\'s Town]]\n| page\t\t= 427\n| previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 28|Cersei VI]]\n| current\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 29|The Reaver]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 30|Jaime IV]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 18|The Iron Captain]]\n| arc next\t=\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Victarion Greyjoy]]\'s \'\'[[Iron Victory]]\'\' has rammed one of the longships of the [[Shield Islands]]. Victarion kills [[Talbert Serry]] of [[Southshield]], and the ironborn\'s massive fleet is soon victorious in their conquest of the Shield Islands which sit at the mouth of the [[Mander]] River north of the Port of [[Oldtown]]. It is Victarion\'s command that won the battle, but it will be King [[Euron Greyjoy|Euron]] they cheer for engineering their bold attack. Back in his cabin, as the [[dusky woman]] Euron gave him tends his wounds, Victarion recalls [[Aeron Greyjoy|Aeron]]\'s words that he would find a way to remove Euron from the [[Seastone Chair]]. He remembers how he had helped capture Lord [[Baelor Blacktyde]], who had refused to acknowledge Euron and paid for it with his life. [[Asha Greyjoy|Asha]], however, had escaped the Iron Islands along with those loyal to her.\n\nLanding at [[Lord Hewett\'s Town]] on [[Oakenshield]], the Lord Captain meets the [[Rodrik Harlaw|Reader]] and the [[Dunstan Drumm|Drumm]]. Both are worried that Euron\'s little conquest will bring ruin down upon them, as surely [[House Tyrell|Highgarden]] will respond. At the feast, Victarion notes that Euron has shamed Lord Hewett and his wife and daughters. The recently crowned king then raises [[Harras Harlaw]], [[Andrik]] the Unsmiling, [[Maron Volmark]] and [[Nute]] the Barber to Lords of the four Shield Islands, effectively stealing away the lieutenants of his adversaries. \n\nEuron declares that they will sail the next day with provisions plundered from the Shield Islands; selling the slaves they had just taken in the [[Free Cities]] on their way to find the dragons he had promised. But many of the captains object, stating that they should attack Oldtown or the [[Arbor]], and Euron stalks from the hall. Soon, one of Euron\'s bastard sons tells the Iron Captain that the king wishes to see him.\n\nIn his room, Euron tells his brother that the Reader was correct that the whole fleet could never reach [[Slaver\'s Bay]] together. But he believes that the Iron Fleet alone could, and promises his brother the Seastone Chair as reward if he sails to [[Slaver\'s Bay]] and returns with [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]]. Euron means to marry her and ascend to the [[Iron Throne]]. With [[Baelor Blacktyde|Lord Blacktyde\'s]] words that \'\'Euron was maddest of them all\'\' on his mind, Victarion agrees to go, thinking to himself,\n{{quote|You stole [[Victarion Greyjoy\'s third wife|my wife]] and despoiled her, so I\'ll have yours.}}\n\n==References and Notes==\n*The synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/07/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-feast-for-crows-part-21 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Feast for Crows, Part 21].

They soon come upon a farmer, his wife and their cart of eggs bound for Maidenpool. As they ride together, the farmer tells Brienne that the town has been mostly rebuilt, thanks to the hard hand of [[Randyll Tarly]]. The Maid of Tarth hopes she can slip through town without encountering the Lord of [[Horn Hill]], as she owes him a debt but bears no liking for the man. At the gates of Maidenpool, the captain informs the farmer that he will take his eggs and wife, forcing Brienne to draw her sword. Outnumbered by the gate guards, she is spared fighting by the appearance of [[Hyle Hunt]], a knight highly placed in Lord Tarly\'s army and a man whom Brienne despises.\n\nHunt begins to mock her and Brienne warns him that she will sort him out in a melee some day, just as she did Red [[Ronnet Connington]] during the melee at [[Ashford]]. She asks him the location of the [[Stinking Goose]], but Ser Hyle takes her to see Lord Randyll first. The commander of [[Mace Tyrell]]\'s vanguard is dispensing his harsh brand of justice when they come upon him. When she is brought before him, Lord Tarly asks her if she killed [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]], and then states he should ship her back to [[Tarth]]. But Brienne reveals the King\'s document that [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] has given her, and she informs Tarly that she is seeking Sansa. He responds that Sansa is not in Maidenpool, nor would she be in [[the Vale]], as Brienne has also assumed, since [[Lysa Arryn]] is dead.\n\nBrienne is shocked to learn that Sansa\'s aunt is dead. She heads off to the tavern, sending Ser Hyle off when he attempts to apologize for his actions at [[Highgarden]]. Later, awaiting the arrival of [[Dick Crabb|Nimble Dick]] at the Stinking Goose, she recalls the hurtful game Hyle and his friends played at her expense. Brienne had gone to Highgarden to answer Renly Baratheon\'s call to banners, expecting to be ridiculed. But unbelievably, many of the young knights she met ([[Ben Bushy|Big Ben Bushy]], [[Edmund Ambrose]], [[Hyle Hunt]], [[Ronnet Connington|Red Ronnet Connington]], [[Hugh Beesbury]], [[Richard Farrow]], [[Owen Inchfield]], and [[Mark Mullendore]]) were exceedingly kind to her, going above and beyond the others to win her favor. Wary of their intentions, Brienne was still vulnerable thanks to hope, but she soon learned the truth. Randyll Tarly called her before him to reveal what he had learned of their game through his son [[Dickon Tarly|Dickon]]. The knights involved had a burgeoning wager on who could claim her maidenhead. Tarly ended their game, but told her the fault lay with herself, claiming her being here encouraged them and that a war host is no place for a maiden.\n\nWhen Dick Crabb finally arrives, Brienne offers to buy him drinks. Nimble Dick soon launches into his story, egged on by a steady bribe from Brienne. He explains how he offered to help a frightened fool&lt;ref&gt;Brienne was hoping for the fool to be Ser [[Dontos Hollard]], whom she expected to be with [[Sansa Stark]] at the time; we find out in the next Brienne chapter that it is instead [[Shagwell]] of the [[Brave Companions]].&lt;/ref&gt; make it across the [[Narrow Sea]]. The fool claimed he had two girls with him, but couldn\'t chance the ports in Maidenpool. So Dick took his coin and took him and the girls along the shore to an old, now-unused smuggler\'s cove, up past [[Crackclaw Point]]. Nimble Dick agrees to take her there for a large sum of coin, pointing out that he is from the area, and warns Brienne of the [[Whispers]], a keep built by a mythical ancestor of his, Ser [[Clarence Crabb]].\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References}}\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/04/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-feast-for-crows-part-10 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Feast for Crows, Part 10].

Tarly again warns her against playing a knight, but Brienne will not give up her mission. She and [[Podrick Payne|Podrick]] meet up with Ser Hyle the next morning, and he tells them of his plan for finding [[Sandor Clegane]]. He reveals that the Hound has not joined [[Beric Dondarrion]], and that the [[Brotherhood Without Banners|Lightning Lord\'s band]] had no part in the raid on Saltpans. Lord Tarly has created this rumour in the hopes of turning the smallfolk against Lord Beric. Ser Hyle knows a septon with great knowledge of the [[Riverlands]], and proposes that they accompany the man to Saltpans. When Brienne says she has no intention of traveling with Hunt, he tells her that he is no longer in Lord Tarly\'s service. They soon depart for Saltpans, while Septon [[Meribald]] talks of the gods, his past and the great bands of wolves in the Riverlands led by a demon of a she-wolf. Meribald tells them there may be broken men about on their way to [[Quiet Isle]], and Brienne surmises that the septon himself once had such an experience before he discovered his piety.\n\n==References and Notes==\n*The synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/06/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-feast-for-crows-part-18 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Feast for Crows, Part 18].

She meets an envoy from [[Astapor]], who represents King [[Cleon]] the great, a former butcher who now rules Astapor, supposedly in Dany\xe2\x80\x99s name. But the envoy suggests that King Cleon wishes to marry Dany, and that the men she left to rule Astapor have all been deposed. Cleon has amassed new slaves, and is beginning to train them as [[Unsullied]], and Daenerys is dismayed that all she has done to free Astapor of slavery is coming undone.\n\nFinally, she sends for Ser [[Jorah Mormont|Jorah]] and Ser [[Barristan Selmy|Barristan]], wishing the two had died in the sewers, but the two knights are greater warriors than even that suicide quest. Barristan speaks of things Daenerys was never aware of, that [[Aerys II Targaryen|her father]] was mad, and that [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]], even as a young boy, seemed to be [[Targaryen madness|more like his father]] than his brother [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]]. The old knight tells her, \n{{quote|The Targaryens have always danced too close to madness. King [[Jaehaerys II Targaryen|Jaehaerys]] once told me that madness and greatness are two sides of the same coin. Every time a [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] is born, the gods toss a coin in the air and the world holds its breath to see how it will land.}}\nShe absolves Barristan, and he swears his sword to her cause. But Ser Jorah does not beg forgiveness, and remains defensive, insisting that he has done nothing wrong. Daenerys then exiles the knight who was once her closest friend and protector, threatening to kill him if she ever sees him again.\n\nLater, [[Daario Naharis|Daario]] warns her that she should not have banished Jorah, and that she may come to regret not keeping him near or having him killed outright. When her advisors urge her to move on, Daenerys decides that she must learn to rule if she ever wishes to sit the throne of [[Westeros]], and she declares that she will stay in Meereen and rule as queen.\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n*[[Missandei]]\n*[[Jhiqui]]\n*[[Irri]]\n*[[Jhogo]]\n*[[Aggo]]\n*[[Rakharo]]\n*[[Grey Worm]]\n*[[Ben Plumm|Brown Ben Plumm]]\n*[[Daario Naharis]]\n*[[Ghael]]\n*[[Belwas|Strong Belwas]]\n*[[Barristan Selmy]]\n*[[Jorah Mormont]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Rhaegal]]\n*[[Drogon]]\n*[[Viserion]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Viserys Targaryen]]\n*[[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]]\n*[[Balerion]]\n*[[Meraxes]]\n*[[Vhagar]]\n*[[Groleo]]\n*[[The Silver]]\n*[[Visenya Targaryen]]\n*[[Rhaenys Targaryen]]\n*[[Grazdan mo Ullhor]]\n*[[Cleon|King Cleon]]\n*[[Eroeh]]\n*[[Rhaegar Targaryen]]\n*[[Mero|Titan\'s Bastard]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Drogo|Khal Drogo]]\n*[[Aerys II Targaryen]]\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n*[[Jaehaerys II Targaryen]]\n*[[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n*[[Xaro Xhoan Daxos]]\n*[[Pyat Pree]]\n*[[Varys]]\n*[[Rhaego]]\n*[[Rhaella Targaryen]]\n*[[Willem Darry]]\n*[[Oznak zo Pahl]]\n*[[Duncan Targaryen]]\n*[[Aegon V Targaryen]]\n|}\n\n==Places and Terms Mentioned==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[Great Pyramid]]\n*[[Meereen]]\n*[[Naath]]\n*[[Westeros]]\n*[[Qarth]]\n*[[Plaza of Punishment]]\n*[[Astapor]]\n*[[Ghis]]\n*[[Valyria]]\n*[[Qarth]]\n*[[Yunkai]]\n*[[New Ghis]]\n*[[Volantis]]\n*[[Vaes Dothrak]]\n*[[Lhazar]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[Free Cities]]\n*[[Trident]]\n*[[Yi Ti]]\n*[[Jade Sea]]\n*[[King\'s Landing]]\n*[[Seven Kingdoms]]\n*[[Temple of the Graces]]\n*[[Slaver\'s Bay]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[Peaceful People]]\n*[[Lord of Harmony (god)|Lord of Harmony]]\n*[[Faith of the Seven]]\n*[[Septon]]\n*[[Common Tongue]]\n*[[Dragon]]\n*[[Tourmaline Brotherhood]]\n*[[Sellsword]]\n*[[Meraxes (ship)|Meraxes]]/\'\'[[Joso\'s Prank]]\'\'\n*[[Unsullied]]\n*[[Great Masters]]\n*[[Tokar]]\n*[[Bloodrider]]\n*\'\'[[Indigo Star]]\'\'\n*[[Good Masters]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[Wise Masters]]\n*\'\'[[khalasar]]\'\'\n*[[Zorse]]\n*[[Stormcrows]]\n*[[Second Sons]]\n*\'\'[[khaleesi]]\'\'\n*[[Sorrowful Men]]\n*[[Battle of the Trident]]\n*[[House Lannister]]\n*[[House Targaryen]]\n*[[Dothraki]]\n*[[Kingsguard]]\n*[[Warlocks]]\n*\'\'[[khal]]\'\'\n|}\n\n==References and Notes==\n* The synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/09/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-45 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Part 45].

When he returns to the ships, he meets with [[Dagmer]] Cleftjaw and arranges for him to lead a force against [[Torrhen\'s Square]], which is a feint to get [[Rodrik Cassel]] to send a force to relieve Torrhen\'s Square.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] has captured [[Benfred Tallhart]] after defeating the force sent to protect the [[Stony Shore]]. Now Benfred is being held between [[Stygg]] and [[Werlag]] as Theon questions him, but he only gets threats about what [[Robb Stark]] will do to him and Benfred\xe2\x80\x99s spittle. [[Aeron Greyjoy]] now insists that Benford be sacrificed to the [[Drowned God]] in the old way for his insult. Theon finally gives in, figuring he may be doing Benfred a service since his neck is thick with muscle and fat, and Stygg is not an expert headman. Theon thinks of when he met Benfred three years past when [[Eddard Stark]] visited Ser [[Helman Tallhart]]. \n\nHe can hear the noise of the men celebrating the victory, but it was like slaughtering sheep. After climbing some stones, Theon can see [[Tymor]] with his brothers, gathering the unhurt mounts, as [[Urzen]] and Black [[Lorren]] kill the horses that cannot be saved. He also sees [[Gevin Harlaw]] sawing off a man\'s finger to get a ring. Theon does not want to search the two men he killed because he can only think of what the now dead [[Eddard Stark]] would say, and it frustrates him. He then sees [[Maron Botley]] with his sons collecting plunder, and one of them in a shoving match with an obviously drunk [[Todric]]. Theon asks [[Wex Pyke]] for his bow and attempts to shoot the ale horn out of Todric\'s hand, but he moves and Theon\xe2\x80\x99s arrow takes him in the belly. This gets the attention of the other looters, and Theon tells them that he will abide no drunkards and no squabbles over plunder. Theon orders Botley to silence Todric. He realizes that his father Lord [[Balon Greyjoy]] gave him the command, but some of his men see him as \xe2\x80\x9ca soft boy from the green lands.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nTheon kicks Benfred\xe2\x80\x99s banner, wondering about the [[Wild hares|rabbit skin]] tied to it. He is frustrated that he does not feel elated as he did after the [[Battle of the Whispering Wood]]. Benfred had not even sent out a scout and ran into a trap to be cut down by a hail of arrows. Theon ordered the leader spared for questioning, not expecting it to be Benfred.\n\nTheon planned the attack on the village well, and his men easily took the sleeping fishing village, which is now just ash. A few were allowed to escape to take word to [[Torrhen\'s Square]], the rest killed except for some women taken for salt wives and thralls. He is not happy, but feels he has no choice. The word about the hosting of the [[Iron Islands]] has been effectively kept secret so the northmen will not realize their peril until [[Deepwood Motte]] and [[Moat Cailin]] are attacked. He damns his sister [[Asha Greyjoy]] in her ship \'\'[[Black Wind]]\'\' again; she will win a castle of her own and gain glory while Theon\xe2\x80\x99s work will be put down to raiders. \n\nTheon left [[Dagmer]] Cleftjaw to guard the ships so that he could be given credit, and Dagmer did not mind. When Theon returns, Dagmer is standing in front of his ship \'\'[[Foamdrinker]]\'\'. He notes that Theon does not smile despite the victory. Theon reports he only lost Todric, whom he killed, and Dagmer smiles telling him some men were born to be killed. As always, Theon appreciates the smile. Theon tells Dagmer that they need to talk, so he takes him to his cabin in \'\'Foamdrinker\'\'.\n\nTheon tells him that they did not capture enough horses, and Dagmer asks why they need horses since Balon ordered them to only harry the coast. Theon, hoping the tone in Dagmer\xe2\x80\x99s voice is interest, not disapproval, tells Dagmer that he is the most skilled in sword and spear on the Iron Islands. Dagmer informs him that [[Andrik]], who serves Lord [[Dunstan Drumm]], and Black [[Lorren]] and [[Qarl the Maid]] are said to be the best now. Theon responds that Andrik is not nearly as feared, and raiding is no work for Lord Balon\xe2\x80\x99s best man. Dagmer tells Theon that it is he who feels wasted, and Theon replies that it should have been him who had his sister\xe2\x80\x99s command. He was valued by [[Robb Stark]] and was one of [[Brynden Tully]]\xe2\x80\x99s picked scouts. He was in the first wave at Whispering Wood, and came close to crossing swords with [[Jaime Lannister|the Kingslayer]] except [[Daryn Hornwood]] came between and died for it. Dagmer states that he knows Theon is no craven, having trained him. Theon asks if his father knows that and states he is no [[House Stark|Stark]] but a [[House Greyjoy|Greyjoy]], and will be his father\xe2\x80\x99s heir, but to be his heir he must prove himself. When Dogmer reminds him he was commanded to raid, Theon responds that he will give Aeron six ships and he can do the raiding; Theon will capture his own castle. Meanwhile Dagmer, with his fearsome reputation, will march on Torrhen\'s Square. [[Helman Tallhart]] took his best men south, and Benfred and their sons are now dead; a small garrison under [[Leobald Tallhart]] is all that is left. He will not make a secret of his approach, and when he arrives will start building siege engines. Dagmer exclaims that this is not the [[Ironborn|Ironmen]]\'s way, and Theon replies that Leobald will not know that, and will call for help. When the [[Rodrik Cassel|castellan]] in [[Winterfell]] learns that a bannerman is being attacked by Dagmer Cleftjaw, he will ride to Leobald\'s aid in strength. Dagmer states he cannot win since the force summoned will be larger than his, and Theon replies that he does not plan to take Torrhen\xe2\x80\x99s Square.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n*Summary and analyses of the chapter [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2012/01/re-read-theon-iii-tis-season-to-be.html in the course of a 10th reread].\n* [http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/05/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-18 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 38, Theon]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 37]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Theon Greyjoy]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Stony Shore]]\n\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 37]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 38, Theon]]</text>\n      <sha1>dxr2nma5y3g43d073gy3izupd95sfrf</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 45</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6882</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166587</id>\n      <parentid>137792</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-25T21:50:03Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4449">{{Infobox Chapter ADwD\n| pov\t\t= [[Arya Stark]]\n| place         = [[Braavos]]\n| title\t\t= The Blind Girl\n| page\t\t= 593\n| previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 44|Jon IX]]\n| current\t= The Blind Girl\n| next\t\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 46|A Ghost in Winterfell]]\n| arc previous\t= \n| arc next\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 64|The Ugly Little Girl]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:Thaldir the Blind Girl.jpg|Arya in the service of the [[House of Black and White]] - art by Tiziano Baracchi. \xc2\xa9 Fantasy Flight Games|thumb|left|300px]]\n[[Arya Stark|Arya]] wakes up after [[skinchanger|entering]] into [[Nymeria (direwolf)|Nymeria]] again; she remembers being feared, but only when she dreams. Arya is still in the [[House of Black and White]] in [[Braavos]]. She has been blinded, to train her to use her other senses: recognize lies from the tone of voice, walk and work without seeing, even fight. She calls herself Blind Beth now. She goes over her list of names, but remembers that that was someone else, not her, not Blind Beth.\n\nThe [[kindly man]] asks her his usual question about three things she has learned. Arya learns to play the lying game with the [[waif]]; this time however she is blind, so instead she learns to use tone of voice to hear the lies. Arya has gotten better at speaking [[High Valyrian]], though the kindly man insists she learn the languages of [[Lys]] and [[Pentos]] as well. As she continues to learn her skills as a blind girl, the kindly man tells her that she has five senses and she should learn to use the other four. An acolyte gets into a duel of staffs with her, teasing her throughout the lesson.\n\nShe reminisces that she liked being the \'\'Cat of the Canals\'\'; she thinks about when she killed [[Dareon]], the deserter from the [[Night\'s Watch]]. The Kindly Man told her that they are not gods to judge who lives or dies, they are just servants of [[Many-Faced God|Him of Many Faces]]. He explains that they are death\'s instruments, not death itself.\n\nAs she goes out to beg, the waif helps her to look the part, putting on a blindfold and giving her pox mark scars to make her look ugly. As she goes out into Braavos past the [[Inn of the Green Eel]], she goes over the areas where she has begged in her mind. Arya crosses the Bloody Bridge and makes her way to [[Pynto]] at the end of Ragman\'s Harbor near the edge of the Drowned Town.\n\nShe hears that two Lysene pirate ships, the \'\'[[Goodheart]]\'\' and the \'\'[[Elephant (ship)|Elephant]]\'\', were driven north by a storm and found [[wildlings]] at [[Hardhome]].&lt;ref&gt;It is revealed that [[Mother Mole]] has been encouraging the wildlings to seek refuge at Hardhome in [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 39|Chaper 39 (Jon VIII)]]; it was also mentioned or at least hinted at in the [[A Dance with Dragons-Prologue|Prologue]]&lt;/ref&gt; The wildlings were eager to board the ships that were prophesied by the witch, and the pirates took the women and children on board, yet meant to sell them as slaves. The \'\'Goodheart\'\' was damaged in another storm and was forced to make for Braavos, where the [[Sealord of Braavos|Sealord]] seized the ship since slave trade is forbidden in Braavos. \n\nArya regularly has wolf dreams, and it is revealed that she has also learned to enter a cat. She uses knowledge gained through the cat\'s eyes to impress the kindly man, telling him that she knows it has been him who is hitting her but without mentioning the cat. Apparently this completes her blind training, because when she opens her eyes again she sees a candle flame, and she has never seen anything so beautiful before.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n* [[Arya Stark | Arya Stark (Blind Beth/Cat) ]]\n* [[Gregor Clegane]]\n* [[Dunsen]]\n* [[Rafford|Raff the Sweetling]]\n* [[Ilyn Payne]]\n* [[Meryn Trant | Ser Meryn]]\n* [[Cersei Lannister]]\n* [[Umma]]\n* [[Waif]]\n* [[Kindly man]]\n* [[Tormo Fregar]]\n* [[S\'vrone]]\n* [[Merling Queen]]\n* [[Syrio Forel]]\n* [[Brusco]]\n* [[Talea]]\n* [[Brea]]\n* [[Meralyn|Merry]]\n* [[Dareon]]\n* [[Eddard Stark]] \n* [[Jon Snow]]\n* [[Sansa Stark]]\n* [[Pynto]]\n* [[Old Nan]]\n* [[Mance Rayder]]\n* [[Mother Mole]]\n}}\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 45]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Arya Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Braavos]]\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 45]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 46, La petite aveugle]]</text>\n      <sha1>231yu1m02uspe2y9s2toh2z6kocnk84</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 2</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6046</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>168747</id>\n      <parentid>99332</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-07-15T19:29:14Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4600">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Catelyn Tully]]\n| place         = [[Riverrun]]\n| title\t\t= Catelyn I\n| page\t\t= 27\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 1|Jaime I]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 2|Catelyn I]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 3|Arya I]]\n| arc previous\t= \n| arc next\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 14|Catelyn II]]\n}}\n    \n==Synopsis==    \nSer [[Desmond Grell]] is [[castellan]] of [[Riverrun]] while [[Edmure Tully|Edmure]] is off at battle and he has confined [[Catelyn Tully|Catelyn]] to [[Hoster Tully|her father]]\xe2\x80\x99s rooms for releasing [[Jaime Lannister|the Kingslayer]] without the consent of King [[Robb Stark|Robb]] or Edmure.  She is aware Grell has dispatched Ser [[Robin Ryger]] to bring back Jaime, and hopes that he fails. Her father\'s room smells of death and it makes Cat think of Ned and her two youngest boys. Lord Hoster is having fever dreams and mumbling, &quot;Forgive me...the blood...oh, please...Tansy...&quot; &quot;Dead.&quot; &quot;\xe2\x80\xa6you\xe2\x80\x99ll have others\xe2\x80\xa6sweet babes, and trueborn\xe2\x80\xa6&quot; Catelyn recalls that [[Lysa Arryn|Lysa]] has had five miscarriages since her marriage and deduces that Lysa must have miscarried before marrying as well. She realizes that [[Jon Arryn]] had no heir at the time of her and Lysa\'s twin betrothals. He was older than their father and as a soiled bride, &quot;Lysa was the price Jon Arryn had to pay for the swords of [[House Tully]].&quot; She does not know who the father of the original miscarriage might have been. Catelyn writes a letter to Lysa pleading for her to come to Riverrun before their father passes away saying, &quot;He needs your forgiveness,&quot; but she realizes Lord Hoster will be gone before the raven even makes it to [[The Eyrie]]. Catelyn goes to the [[sept]] and lights three candles. One for the [[Father (the Seven)|Father Above]] for her own father. One for the [[Crone (the Seven)|Crone]] &quot;who let the first raven into the world when she peered through the door of death&quot; and one for the [[Mother (the Seven)|Mother]] for Lysa and all the children they had both lost. \n\nLater, Edmure returns to Riverrun, informing Catelyn that he turned away the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]], but that [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] lost the [[Battle of the Blackwater|battle]] for [[King\'s Landing]] and that [[Highgarden]] and [[Dorne]] have both declared for [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]]. Edmure scolds Catelyn for freeing Jaime and tells her [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] will never free Catelyn\'s daughters, but Catelyn claims [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] will be held to the word he spoke in open court and the Kingslayer gave his word as well. Edmure dismisses the Kingslayer\'s words as worthless and informs Catelyn that Tyrion took an axe to the head and is most likely dead. Edmure has sent three ravens informing [[Roose Bolton|Lord Bolton]] that Jaime has escaped in the hopes of capturing him at [[Harrenhal]]. Catelyn despairs because if Jaime is believed to have escaped instead of being released as part of a prisoner swap, the Lannisters have no reason to free Catelyn\'s daughters.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Desmond Grell]]\n*[[Edmure Tully]]\n*[[Catelyn Tully]]\n*[[Hoster Tully]]\n*[[Jaime Lannister]] Kingslayer\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Robin Ryger]]\n*[[Lysa Arryn]]\n*[[Jon Arryn]]\n*[[Stannis Baratheon]]\n*[[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n*[[Cersei Lannister]]\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Roose Bolton]]\n}}\t\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Castellan]]\n*[[Riverrun]]\n*[[House Tully]]\n*[[The Eyrie]]\n*[[Sept]]\n*[[Father (the Seven)|Father Above]]\n*[[Crone (the Seven)|Crone]]\n*[[Mother (the Seven)|Mother]]\n*[[House Lannister]]\n*[[Battle of the Blackwater]]\n*[[King\'s Landing]]\n*[[Highgarden]]\n*[[Dorne]]\n*[[Harrenhal]]\n}}\n\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n* The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].    \n*[http://slynt.blogspot.nl/2012/06/re-read-catelyn-i-in-boring-room.html Analyses and summary of the chapter] in the course of a 10th reread by Slynth. \n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/09/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-2 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords part 2] Analyses and summary by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Storm of Swords: Chapter 02]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Catelyn Tully]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Riverrun]]\n[[es:Tormenta de Espadas-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 2]]\n[[fr:A Storm of Swords, Chapitre 03, Catelyn]]\n[[zh:&amp;#20912;&amp;#38632;&amp;#30340;&amp;#39118;&amp;#26292;-&amp;#31456;&amp;#33410; 2]]</text>\n      <sha1>rhjkgs47iowxf5ii799nw6reuiysdqm</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 43</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5804</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>197777</id>\n      <parentid>186365</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2017-03-03T21:38:25Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Nittanian</username>\n        <id>3504</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6380">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Arya Stark|Arya]]\n| title\t\t= Arya VIII\n| place         = [[High Heart]] - ruined village of Lord [[House Goodbrook|Goodbrook]]\n| page\t\t= 489\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 42|Daenerys IV]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 43|Arya VIII]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 44|Jaime VI]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 39|Arya VII]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 47|Arya IX]]\n}}\n\n[[Arya Stark]] and the [[brotherhood without banners]] visit the [[ghost of High Heart]]. Arya escapes the outlaws but is captured by the [[Hound]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:Prophecy.jpg|thumb|350px|left|The [[ghost of High Heart]] tells some of her [[prophecies and dreams|dreams]].&lt;br&gt;\xc2\xa9 Fantasy Flight Games]]\n[[Gendry]] mentions that Master [[Tobho Mott|Mott]] considered [[Thoros of Myr|Thoros]] a false priest, and Thoros agrees. He was sent to the [[Seven Kingdoms]] to bring word of [[R\'hllor]], but he spent his time eating and whoring. King [[Robert I Baratheon|Robert]] was fond of him, and many enjoyed the sight of his flaming sword in melees. Lord [[Beric Dondarrion|Beric]] silences Thoros by saying, &quot;Fire consumes. It consumes, and when it is done there is nothing left. Nothing.&quot; The outlaws reach [[High Heart]] again, and the ancient dwarf woman calls Beric the Lord of Corpses, for the stink of the grave is fresh on him. The [[ghost of High Heart]] tells them her dreams: the [[Balon Greyjoy|kraken king]] is dead, and Lord [[Hoster Tully|Hoster]] too; the [[Vargo Hoat|goat]] sits alone in the [[Harrenhal|hall of kings]] in a fever &quot;as the [[Gregor Clegane|great dog]] [[capture of Harrenhal|descends on him]]&quot;; she dreamt of drums and pipes and screams [[Red Wedding|making a great clangor]]; and &quot;of [[Sansa Stark|a maid]] at a feast with purple serpents in her hair, venom dripping from their fangs. And later I dreamt that maid again, slaying a savage giant in a castle built of snow.&quot; Suddenly, she spots [[Arya Stark|Arya]], and calls her &quot;blood child&quot; and &quot;dark heart&quot;, bidding her to leave. When Beric explains to the old dwarf woman that Arya is being brought to [[Riverrun]], she tells them to seek [[Catelyn Stark|her mother]] at the [[Twins]], for there is to be a wedding. She then demands a song as payment for her dreams, the same song she always requests from [[Tom of Sevenstreams|Tom]]; [[Jenny of Oldstones]].\n\nLater, Arya speaks with [[Edric Dayne]], who is called Ned like [[Eddard Stark|her father]]. Edric tells her that he saw her father during [[the Hand\'s tourney]] while he squired for Lord Beric. He reveals that Beric was promised to [[Allyria Dayne|his aunt]], \xe2\x80\x9cbut that was before he died\xe2\x80\x9d, Arya thinks to herself. Ned tells her of [[Wylla]], his [[wet nurse]], who he says is the mother of [[Jon Snow]]. She has been in the service of the [[House Dayne|Daynes]] for years, and Ned is surprised that Arya\xe2\x80\x99s father never spoke of her nor of [[Ashara Dayne|Ashara]], Ned\xe2\x80\x99s aunt. He tells Arya that her father and Ashara fell in love during the [[tourney at Harrenhal]], and that she killed herself after the war because her heart was broken. Arya does not believe the young Lord of [[Starfall]], believing her father only loved her mother. She asks [[Harwin]] about it, and he confirms that Eddard and Ashara may have fallen in love at Harrenhal, but at that time his brother [[Brandon Stark|Brandon]] was betrothed to Catelyn. He claims that Ashara killed herself over grief for [[Arthur Dayne|her brother]], and tells Arya &quot;Let it lie, my lady. They\xe2\x80\x99re dead, all of them.&quot;\n\nWhen the outlaws come upon a ruined village, Arya thinks the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] destroyed it, but she is told that the village was destroyed years before by Hoster Tully, because Lord [[House Goodbrook|Goodbrook]], the lord of the village, had fought for the [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]] during [[Robert\'s Rebellion]]. Later, Thoros sees in his flames that Riverrun will soon come under attack by the Lannisters again, and he believes the ghost\xe2\x80\x99s dream that Catelyn and Robb are at the Twins. That night, Arya sneaks off while everyone else is asleep, feeling that the outlaws cannot be her pack if they want to ransom her off to her [[Robb Stark|brother]], mother, or uncle [[Brynden Tully|Brynden]].

Afterwards she baths in the [[Womb of the World]] and goes to the reception feast. [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]] soon arrives, drunk and screaming. He draws his blade and demands what he is owed. [[Khal]] [[Drogo]] gives him a crown of molten gold.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:Stallion heart.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Daenerys eats a stallion heart ([[Game of Thrones|TV series]]) \xc2\xa9 HBO]]\n\nThe [[Stallion heart|stallion\xe2\x80\x99s heart]] is still raw and steaming when it is placed before [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]]. As part of the ancient [[Dothraki]] motherhood ritual she begins to eat the tough, stringy flesh. The Dothraki believe that the heart of the stallion will make her son strong and swift and fearless. If she chokes on the blood or retches the omens are less favorable: the child could be weak, deformed, stillborn, or female. In preparation, Daenerys has eaten bowls of blood and dried horse flesh and fasted for a day and a half, yet still her stomach roils and her jaw aches.\n\n[[Khal]] [[Drogo]] stands over her as she eats, his face hard, but as she continues Daenerys begins to see pride in his eyes. When she is done, Daenerys pronounces the words she has rehearsed to the \'\'[[dosh khaleen]]\'\', the crones of [[Vaes Dothrak]]. Even the most powerful \'\'khals\'\' bow to the wisdom and authority of these crones, each of whom is the \'\'[[khaleesi]]\'\' of a dead \'\'khal\'\'. \n\nThe crones proclaim, \xe2\x80\x9cThe prince is riding; a boy, a boy, a strong boy,\xe2\x80\x9d and begin to chant. After the crowd finishes chanting there is silence. Then one of the crones announces the greatness of the new prince, the [[Stallion Who Mounts the World]]. Daenerys reveals the name of her son: [[Rhaego]], in honor of her [[Rhaegar Targaryen|older brother]]. \n\nKhal Drogo leads her out of the pit with his [[Bloodrider|bloodriders]] behind, followed by the rest, down the godsway. As they walk, Drogo asks about the name of their son and Daenerys explains about her brother, a fierce warrior who died before she was born; the last of the dragons. Drogo declares that it is a good name.\n\n[[File:Drogo Proud.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Drogo\'s pride ([[Game of Thrones|TV series]]) \xc2\xa9 HBO]]\n\nEventually they arrive at the lake called the [[Womb of the World]]. Here Daenerys strips out of her soiled clothing and enters the lake. She cleanses her face and body of the dried blood. When she emerges from the lake, [[Doreah]] brings her a robe of sandsilk, but Drogo waves her away. Daenerys can see his manhood through his trousers and helps him unlace; with three quick strokes, he is done.\n\n[[File:Zach Graves The Womb of the World.JPG|thumb|300px|right|The Womb of the World - \xc2\xa9 FFG]]\n\nThey ride down the godsway to Drogo\xe2\x80\x99s tent-hall where there is a great feast prepared for those too low of rank to attend the ceremony. As Dany rides up the aisle, the crowd hails the life within her. When she dismounts, Daenerys cannot find [[Viserys Targaryen]]. She sees Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] in a place of respect in the midst of the hierarchy and invites him to her own table.\n\nWhen Ser Jorah arrives she asks about Viserys. He explains that her brother went to the market to find wine. Daenerys then questions why he was allowed to go alone since [[Robert Baratheon|the Usurper]] would pay well for his head. Ser Jorah assures her that Viserys should be safe, as nobody can carry a blade or shed a man\xe2\x80\x99s blood in [[Vaes Dothrak]]. Daenerys states that men still die; some of the merchants have huge eunuchs to strangle thieves bloodlessly. Ser Jorah declares that her brother should be wise enough not to steal anything. The knight goes on to explain that her brother was going to steal her dragon eggs until he threatened to cut off Viserys\' hand. Daenerys declares that she would have given Viserys an egg if he had asked: she does owe him for their survival and he is all she has left of her family. Jorah tells her that she belongs to the Dothraki now. \n\nDaenerys asks Ser Jorah about the Stallion Who Mounts the World. He explains that the Stallion is the \'\'khal\'\' of \'\'khals\'\', who is prophesized to unite the Dothraki into a single \'\'[[khalasar]]\'\' and lead them to conquer the world. \n\nDoreah interrupts Daenerys to point out her brother entering the hall in rags, drunk, and carrying a sword. Angry mutterings rise all around her and the music dies away. Daenerys has a sense of dread and asks Ser Jorah to stop him and bring him to her. Viserys starts screaming for Daenerys and reproaching the indignity of starting the feast before his arrival. Ser Jorah is quickly by his side and tries to stop him, but Viserys jerks free. Then he moves to sit with Drogo and the other \'\'khals\'\'. \n\nDrogo rises and declares through translation that Viserys\xe2\x80\x99 place is not on the high bench but at the back where the lowest of the low sit shrouded in shadow so that others do not have to look upon them. Viserys declares drunkenly that that is no place for a king, but Drogo emphasizes that it is his place, mocking him as the Sore-foot King and the Cart King. Viserys draws his blade, angering the Dothraki.Then he spots Daenerys and stalks over. She begs him to throw away the sword but Viserys ignores her. Viserys demands his crown or else he will take Daenerys back, but he will be happy to cut out her child and leave it for Drogo. To emphasis his point, Viserys presses his sword against her belly hard enough to prick her navel through her silks. \n\n[[File:GoT A Golden Crown.jpg||thumb|320px|right|&quot;You cannot touch me! I am the Dragon!&quot; ([[Game of Thrones|TV series]]) \xc2\xa9 HBO]]\n\n[[Jhiqui]] is sobbing in fear, stating that she dare not translate Viserys\xe2\x80\x99 words; if she does she fears Khal Drogo will drag her behind his horses up the [[Mother of Mountains]]. Daenerys agrees to translate instead. After hearing the translation, Drogo makes a statement in Dothraki and steps down from the high bench with his bloodriders. Viserys asks and Daenerys translates: \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall have a splendid golden crown that men shall tremble to behold.\xe2\x80\x9d Viserys smiles and declares that that is all he ever wanted. His smile is what saddens Daenerys the most. \n\nDrogo orders his bloodriders to seize the man who was her brother, breaking his arm and taking away his sword in the process. Drogo puts his belt of golden medallions into an emptied stew pot. Viserys finally realizes what is happening and begins to plead and struggle. Ser Jorah tells Daenerys to look away, but she refuses. When the gold is half melted, Drogo declares \xe2\x80\x9cCrown for Cart King!\xe2\x80\x9d and upends the pot over Viserys\xe2\x80\x99 head. Soon it is over; not a drop of blood is spilled. Daenerys thinks, surprisingly calmly, that Viserys was no dragon, because fire cannot kill a dragon.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/09/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-23 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/047/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 46]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Daenerys Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Vaes Dothrak]]\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 46]]\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 47, Daenerys]]\n[[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\x94\xd1\x8d\xd0\xb9\xd0\xbd\xd0\xb5\xd1\x80\xd0\xb8\xd1\x81 V]]</text>\n      <sha1>ka5yds9y1jimmcowqrdlwv7fsg2cj4d</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 22</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5681</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>198415</id>\n      <parentid>161646</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2017-04-06T20:23:02Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Nittanian</username>\n        <id>3504</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4072">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Arya Stark|Arya]]\n| title\t\t= Arya IV\n| place         = [[High Heart]] - [[Acorn Hall]]\n| page\t\t= 246\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 21|Jaime III]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 22|Arya IV]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 23|Daenerys II]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 17|Arya III]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 29|Arya V]]\n}}\n\nThe [[brotherhood without banners]] searches for [[Beric Dondarrion]], and [[Arya Stark]] sees the [[ghost of High Heart]].\n\n==Synopsis==    \nThe outlaws first visit Lord [[Lymond Lychester]] and then the [[Lady of the Leaves]] in search of word on Lord [[Beric Dondarrion]]\'s whereabouts. But none have seen him, only hearing rumors that he was dead\xe2\x80\x94hanged once, killed by [[Vargo Hoat]], [[Amory Lorch]], and twice by [[Gregor Clegane]]. [[Arya Stark|Arya]] heard similar rumors at [[Harrenhal]], but [[Lem]] and [[Tom of Sevenstreams|Tom]] know that Beric is still alive. \n\nThe outlaws plan to ransom Arya at [[Riverrun]] after they meet up with Beric and [[Thoros of Myr]]. They arrive at [[High Heart]], an ancient hill sacred to the [[children of the forest]]. Thirty-one mighty [[weirwood]]s had stood at the top of the hill, but only their stumps remained from after the [[Andals]] chopped them down. Arya can still feel the power of the place. An [[Ghost of High Heart|old dwarf woman]] speaks in private to Lem, Tom, and [[Greenbeard]], but Arya overhears the conversation. The woman has dreams while sleeping among the weirwood stumps, and tells them she had dreamed of &quot;a shadow with a burning heart killing a golden stag&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;A likely reference to the death of [[Renly Baratheon]].&lt;/ref&gt; of &quot;a man without a face, waiting on a swaying bridge, on his shoulder perched a drowned crow with seaweed hanging from its wings&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;A likely reference to the death of [[Balon Greyjoy]].&lt;/ref&gt; and of &quot;a raging river and a woman that was a fish\xe2\x80\xa6dead with red tears on her cheeks, but when her eyes did open, I woke from terror.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;A likely reference to the death of [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn Tully]].&lt;/ref&gt; \n\nAt [[Acorn Hall]], [[Ravella Swann|Lady Smallwood]] informs them that Thoros had been through recently, and that [[House Karstark|Karstark]] men were searching for the [[Jaime Lannister|Kingslayer]]. Arya and [[Gendry]] go off to the smithy, and the former apprentice explains that Thoros was a charlatan, using regular swords with [[wildfire]] to make his flaming sword.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Lymond Lychester]]\n*[[Lady of the Leaves]]\n*[[Beric Dondarrion]]\n*[[Vargo Hoat]]\n*[[Amory Lorch]]\n*[[Gregor Clegane]]\n*[[Arya Stark]]\n*[[Lem]]\n*[[Tom of Sevenstreams]]\n*[[Thoros of Myr]]\n*[[ghost of High Heart]]\n*[[Greenbeard]]\n*[[Renly Baratheon]]\n*[[Balon Greyjoy]]\n*[[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn Tully]]\n*[[Ravella Swann]], Lady Smallwood\n*[[Jaime Lannister]], the Kingslayer\n*[[Gendry]]\n}}\t\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Harrenhal]]\n*[[Riverrun]]\n*[[High Heart]]\n*[[children of the forest]]\n*[[weirwood]]\n*[[Andal]]\n*[[Acorn Hall]]\n*[[House Karstark]]\n*[[wildfire]]\n}}\n\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References}}\n\n* The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].    \n* [http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/01/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-13 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords part 13].

Unable to speak, the maester gives him [[milk of the poppy]]. Later, when the maester returns, Tyrion knocks the poppy from his hands and demands the cast be removed from his face. Maester [[Ballabar]] keeps mumbling about [[Cersei Lannister|the Queen]]\xe2\x80\x99s orders, but Tyrion will not listen. He demands wine not poppy, and looks upon his destroyed face in a mirror. Three-quarters of his nose is gone along with part of his lip, and the stitching job was sloppy. Tyrion sends the maester away and asks for [[Podrick Payne]]. The boy arrives, and Tyrion swears him to silence about what occurred at the docks with Ser [[Mandon Moore]]. He tells Pod to bring Maester [[Frenken]], for he does not trust this new maester.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n\n* The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n* [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2012/02/re-read-tyrion-xv-shrimp.html Analyses and summary of the chapter] in the course of a 10th reread by Slynt.\n* [http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/09/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-32 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 67]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Tyrion Lannister]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 67]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 68, Tyrion]]</text>\n      <sha1>74iqexb2thejqwml0mv0sr3y9qlyx6t</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 32</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5773</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>183777</id>\n      <parentid>164456</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-05-08T21:11:13Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3901">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]]\n| title\t\t= Tyrion IV\n| place         = [[King\'s Landing]]\n| page\t\t= 352\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 31|Jaime IV]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 32|Tyrion IV]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 33|Samwell II]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 19|Tyrion III]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 38|Tyrion V]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] visits [[Symon Silvertongue]], and thinks to pay him to leave [[King\'s Landing]].

He blackmails Tyrion by indicating that he will tell about his relation with [[Shae]]. Tyrion promises him that one of the other singers will be removed, and [[Bronn]] will visit him in three days\' time. Outside, Tyrion orders Bronn to kill Symon. \n\nLater, [[Tywin Lannister|Tyrion\'s father]] shows him the two new [[Valyrian steel|Valyrian]] swords he had made for Joffrey and [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]. Master [[Tobho Mott]] reworked the metal, and the color of the blade on each sword is black and red. [[House Lannister]] has not had a Valyrian sword in hundreds of years, and try as he might, Tywin could never get any of the lesser houses to sell theirs. Where the steel for these new swords came from is not revealed. Tywin tells him that he must consummate his marriage to [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]], and that [[Mace Tyrell]] rejected the marriage proposal between [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] and [[Willas Tyrell|Willas]], probably because the [[Olenna Redwyne|Queen of Thorns]] told him to. \n\n[[Pycelle]] brings dire tidings from [[the Wall]], and that Maester [[Aemon Targaryen (son of Maekar I)|Aemon]] fears Lord [[Jeor Mormont|Mormont]] is dead. Tywin tells Pycelle to send a veiled message that no men shall be sent to the Wall unless [[Janos Slynt]] is considered for the post of [[Lord Commander of the Night\'s Watch]].

Stannis has Arnolf, his son [[Arthor Karstark|Arthor]] and three grandsons arrested and plans to execute them, though whether their death will be quick beheadings or by fire depends on their willingness to confess. Stannis is preparing his position to battle the coming vanguard of [[Roose Bolton]]\'s army led by [[Hosteen Frey]]. Stannis is sending Ser [[Justin Massey]] to escort &quot;[[Arya Stark]]&quot; (actually [[Jeyne Poole]], though this is unknown to Stannis) back to the Wall to reunite the girl with her brother [[Jon Snow]] in gratitude for Snow warning him to amass the [[northern mountain clans]] rather than march straight into Arnolf\'s trap.\n\nStannis also orders Massey to go with Tycho Nestoris to [[Braavos]], where Massey will use the money given to him by the [[Iron Bank of Braavos]] to hire sellsword companies until he has a force no less than twenty thousand strong, and then sail back to [[Westeros]]. Stannis also gives orders that if he is slain in the coming battle, Massey is still to do as instructed, with the intention of using the army to place [[Shireen Baratheon|Shireen]] on the Iron Throne.\n\nStannis also plans to have [[Theon Greyjoy]] executed, hoping to gain favor with his northern allies by exacting justice for the murders of [[Bran Stark|Bran]] and [[Rickon Stark]].

Qhorin confirms this. He knew Mance when he was a black brother, and the ranger tells Jon that Mance loved songs and [[wildling]] women, and that he was a wildling captured as a child by the Watch. He was the best ranger they had, but he returned to his roots, some say to gain a crown. Qhorin suspects that Jon let Ygritte go, and Jon confirms that he did, however Qhorin understands that the girl was not a threat, and if he had wanted her dead he would have had [[Ebben]] do it, or have done it himself. Qhorin tells Jon that he now knows him better than he did before, and that it is important for a commander to know his men.\n\nThey travel at night and rest during the day. That morning, Jon dreams of five direwolves, when there should have been six. Seeing through the eyes of [[Ghost]], he finds himself in a forest and senses a voice calling his name from a nearby [[weirwood]] with a face resembling [[Bran Stark|his brother]]\'s, except it has three eyes. His brother explains to him how to open his eyes, and the tree reaches down and touches him, and he finds himself back in the mountains. He is atop a cliff, and oversees thousands of men training for combat. He also sees [[mammoth]]s with [[giants]] riding them. Suddenly, an [[Orell|eagle]] soars out of the sky coming straight for him. Jon awakens shouting Ghost\xe2\x80\x99s name. The others hear his shout, and he tells them what he saw. Qhorin calls it a wolf dream, and Ebben calls Jon a [[skinchanger]]. Qhorin, however, does not balk at the thought of wargs and giants during a time when the dead walk and the trees have eyes again. They set out just before dusk, and spot an eagle watching them, well out of bowshot. \n\nSoon after, they find Ghost wounded and dress the direwolf\'s wounds. Qhorin tells them they must head back to the [[Fist of the First Men|Fist]], for they have been seen by the eagle which they fear is a skinchanger as well. They begin the journey back through the [[Skirling Pass]] without lighting any fires despite the cold. But their lead on the enemy is shortening, and when they come upon the place where the wildlings were killed, Squire [[Dalbridge]] remains behind with all their arrows, sacrificing himself to give the others an advantage.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n* [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2012/01/re-read-jon-vii-hotel-skirling-pass.html Analyses and summary of the chapter] in the course of a 10th reread by Slynt.\n* [http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/07/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-26 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n* The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 53]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Jon Snow]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Skirling Pass]]\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 53]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 54, Jon]]</text>\n      <sha1>pd5n474slmf530i97pn4pp8jmmwjaay</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Clash of Kings-Chapter 49</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5670</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166451</id>\n      <parentid>139758</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-23T20:57:37Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3335">{{Infobox Chapter ACfK\n| pov\t\t= [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n| place         = [[King\'s Landing]]\n| title\t\t= Tyrion XI\n| page\t\t= 517\n| previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 48|Daenerys IV]]\n| current\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 49|Tyrion XI]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 50|Theon IV]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 44|Tyrion X]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 54|Tyrion XII]]\n}}\n    \n==Synopsis==    \n[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] dispatches his clansmen into the [[kingswood]] to raid [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]\'s baggage trains, ambush his scouts, and perform night raids. Tyrion feels he can trust only about a quarter of the 6,000 men in the [[City Watch of King\'s Landing |City Watch]], and feels unprepared for the coming battle. He orders [[Bronn]] to start burning down the houses along the wall by the quay, feeling that the enemy could scale the wall easier by climbing on the roofs of the houses. Tyrion is aware that [[Winterfell]] has fallen to the [[ironmen]]. [[Balon Swann]] has been named to the Kingsguard to replace [[Preston Greenfield]], and Tyrion approves, but he does not approve of Cersei\xe2\x80\x99s choice of [[Osmund Kettleblack]] to replace [[Boros Blount]]. Blount was stripped of his white cloak after he surrendered [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] immediately when [[Jacelyn Bywater|Jacelyn]]\xe2\x80\x99s men overtook them. Blount is rotting in [[Rosby]]\xe2\x80\x99s dungeon on the count of treason, since the Kingsguard are supposed to give their lives in defending the royal family. \n\nTyrion has appointed the new [[High Septon]], and tells him to warn the people that Stannis means to burn the [[Great Sept of Baelor]]. Tyrion is also visited by [[Hallyne]] the Pyromancer from the [[Alchemists\' Guild]], and is surprised to learn that they have 13,000 jars of [[wildfire]], way ahead of schedule. When Tyrion asks why, the pyromancer explains that their spells have been more potent of late, but is at a loss to explain why. He does ask Tyrion if there are any [[dragon]]s about, and elaborates something he heard a long time ago, that magic began to disappear from the world when the last dragon died. \n\nJacelyn informs Tyrion that Tommen is safe, but the Hand does not know where the boy is being kept in case Tyrion is captured and tortured by the invaders. [[Varys]] then informs Tyrion of a plot by several merchants calling themselves [[Antler Men]] to arm commoners in the streets. Tyrion writes the order for their arrest, one of them being the master smith [[Salloreon]].\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n*[http://slynt.blogspot.com/2012/01/re-read-tyrion-ix-business-as-usual.html Analyses and summary of the chapter] in the course of a 10th reread by Slynt.\n* [http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/06/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-24 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n* The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].   \n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 49]]    \n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Tyrion Lannister]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in King\'s Landing]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 49]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 50, Tyrion]]</text>\n      <sha1>peofl3uk1deafu7y9spc1fh5a4vd90m</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Clash of Kings-Chapter 36</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6210</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166440</id>\n      <parentid>162927</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-23T20:53:17Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7442">{{Infobox Chapter ACfK\n| pov\t\t= [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n| place         = [[King\'s Landing]]\n| title\t\t= Tyrion VIII\n| page\t\t= 386\n| previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 35|Bran V]]\n| current\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 36|Tyrion VIII]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 37|Theon III]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 29|Tyrion VII]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 41|Tyrion IX]]\n}}\n\nThe [[small council]] is discussing the news of [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]]\'s mysterious murder. [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] points out that they have an opportunity to recruit [[House Tyrell]] to [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey I]] since they loved Renly but not [[Stannis Baratheon]]. To recruit them, Tyrion recommends that Joffrey marry [[Margaery Tyrell]]. [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] does not like the idea, stating Joffrey will not like it, but eventually agrees. Neither Cersei nor Tyrion want to leave King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing to meet with the Tyrells but [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] volunteers, expecting a reward for his service.\n==Synopsis==\n[[Varys]] reports the [[Siege of Storm\'s End (299)|mysterious murder]] of [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]], whose throat was cut like soft cheese. The reports of the murderer vary: Stannis with a [[Lightbringer|magic sword]], a knight of his [[Rainbow Guard]], a maid, a woman spurned, or Lady [[Catelyn Tully|Catelyn Stark]]. The [[small council]], including [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]], [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]], and [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]], are not pleased with the report since they expect the truth, not rumors. Varys assures them it is not a ruse, and that Renly is dead.\n\nTyrion notes that [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] will not be happy since he was reserving a spike for Renly\xe2\x80\x99s head. Tyrion himself is also unhappy since he was depending on the brothers to decimate each other\'s armies in battle, but points out the killer\'s identity is irrelevant; Stannis has to be behind Renly\'s death, as he stood to gain the most from it.\n\nVarys reports the foot remain at [[Bitterbridge]] and most of the lords have gone over to [[Stannis Baratheon]] with, as Littlefinger assumed, Lord [[Alester Florent]] being first. [[Loras Tyrell]], [[Randyll Tarly]], and [[Mathis Rowan]] did not switch allegiance, and  Ser [[Cortnay Penrose]] will not yield [[Storm\'s End]] until he sees Renly\xe2\x80\x99s body, which has disappeared. A fifth of the knights left with Loras, who had killed three of Renly\xe2\x80\x99s guards in anger, including [[Emmon Cuy]] and [[Robar Royce]]. Loras is probably headed to Bitterbridge for his sister [[Margaery Tyrell]] and the foot still there. Tyrion notes that this is an opportunity to win the Tyrells to their cause; they may have loved Renly, but perhaps they can be convinced to prefer Joffrey over Stannis. Littlefinger suggests bribes, but both Varys and Tyrion do not think gold will win [[Highgarden]]. Littlefinger admits they are right, and states that Loras, although a younger son, is [[Mace Tyrell]]\xe2\x80\x99s favorite, so they just have to win him. Tyrion suggests marrying 15- or 16-year-old Margaery to the 13-year-old Joffrey. Cersei objects that Joffrey is promised to [[Sansa Stark]], but Tyrion responds that there is no advantage in wedding the king to the daughter of a [[Eddard Stark|dead traitor]]. Littlefinger adds that the Tyrells are wealthier than the [[House Stark|Starks]] and Margaery is lovely and beddable. \n\nWhen Tyrion states that Joffrey should like this, Cersei replies her son is too young to care about such things. Tyrion notes that he was the same age as Joffrey when he married. Cersei insists that Joffrey is made of finer stuff, but Tyrion reminds her that he ordered Sansa stripped by Ser [[Boros Blount]].\n\nTyrion has spoken to Varys about arranging a secret visit to [[Chataya]]\xe2\x80\x99s for Joffrey; Tyrion hopes that it will sweeten him. He noted that they will have to arrange to do it when [[Sandor Clegane]] is busy. Varys agreed to look into the matter.\n\nTyrion tells Cersei that the marriage may be the only way for Joffrey to live to his wedding night and Littlefinger adds that Sansa brings only her body to Joffrey\xe2\x80\x99s bed, while Margaery would bring 50,000 swords. Varys adds that the needs of the realm come before the king\xe2\x80\x99s own desires. Cersei states that the king would never agree to Renly\xe2\x80\x99s leavings, and  Tyrion replies that when the king comes of age in 3 years he can make his own decisions, but until then he does as the [[Hand of the King]] and the regent say. Cersei agrees but warns them if Joffrey does not like Margaery.\n\nTyrion brings up the need to send one of them to Bitterbridge before Loras\xe2\x80\x99 blood cools; Loras will scarcely deal with [[Bronn]] or [[Shagga]]. Cersei first recommends Ser [[Jacelyn Bywater]], but Tyrion points out that whoever they send must be able to make decisions for the king and council. Cersei recommends Tyrion as [[Hand of the King]] and Tyrion recommends Cersei as the king\xe2\x80\x99s mother. Littlefinger volunteers, stating he would make a poor hostage and neither Loras nor Mace bears any enmity towards him. Tyrion does not like it since he does not trust Littlefinger but if he leaves [[King\'s Landing]] for any time, everything he worked for would be undone. There is fighting on the route to Bitterbridge, so Littlefinger will need a strong escort. Tyrion initially offers 100 [[City Watch of King\'s Landing|gold cloaks]] and they agree on 300 plus 40 knights with squires to give Littlefinger a knightly tail to impress the Tyrells. Littlefinger states he will take [[Horas Redwyne]] and [[Hobber Redwyne]] (Horror and Slobber) who will be sent on to their father as a gesture of good will since [[Paxter Redwyne]] is an old friend of Mace Tyrell\'s. Cersei expresses wrath at this since [[House Redwyne]] would have declared for Renly except for the twins being held hostage. Littlefinger notes that Renly is dead and Stannis and Lord Paxter have an enmity against each other from the siege of Storm\'s End. Tyrion decides to send Ser Hobber and keep Ser Horas in King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing. Littlefinger also demands plenty of horses and gold, and a commission in writing, which Tyrion agrees to, so Littlefinger states he will start before dawn, but is expecting a suitable reward for his services. Cersei asks him  what he wants, and Littlefinger replies he will think about it. Tyrion instructs Varys to get parchment and quill, and they will need someone to wake Joffrey.\n\nCersei asks Tyrion about his chain, and he tells her it is getting longer link by link, and that they should thank Ser Cortnay since Stannis will not march north with Storm\xe2\x80\x99s End untaken. Cersei now tells Tyrion that he has been a great help, contrary to what she expected, and kisses him on the brow.\n\nWhen Cersei leaves, Tyrion tells Bronn that Cersei is up to something, and asks Bronn to try to find out what; Tyrion hates surprises.\n\n==See Also==\n* Summary and analyses of the chapter [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2011/12/re-read-tyrion-viii-meeting-over-renlys.html in the course of a 10th reread].\n* [http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/05/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-17 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 36]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Tyrion Lannister]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 36]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 37, Tyrion]]</text>\n      <sha1>kp7zittijzfpg4ylazoaouw34h4jpyx</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Game of Thrones-Chapter 13</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>3548</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>165956</id>\n      <parentid>133046</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-17T14:10:50Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6626">{{Infobox Chapter AGoT\n| pov\t\t= [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n| place         = North of [[Winterfell]] on the way to [[Castle Black]]\n| title\t\t= Tyrion II\n| page\t\t= \n| previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 12|Eddard II]]\n| current\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 13|Tyrion II]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 14|Catelyn III]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 9|Tyrion I]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 21|Tyrion III]]\n}} __NOTOC__\n\nAs they travel north [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] and [[Jon Snow]] argue about the realities of life on the [[Wall]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nAfter a fortnight riding north from [[Winterfell]] with [[Benjen Stark]], [[Jon Snow]], and two of his own retainers, [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] is amazed by the enormous size of [[the North]]. Although he knows the maps of the region as well as anyone, the land itself is quite another thing. It has grown colder, quieter, and far lonelier the farther north they go and the Kingsroad has narrowed to a wild track.\n\nThree days out of Winterfell the farmland has given way to the dense, dark forests of the [[Wolfswood]]. There they meet up with [[Yoren]], a brother of the [[Night\'s Watch]], accompanied by two peasant boys condemned to join the Watch. That night Tyrion notices Jon Snow looking at their new companions with dismay and feels sorry for the boy who has had such a hard life chosen for him. Tyrion feels less sympathy for Benjen Stark, who apparently shares his [[Eddard Stark|brother]]\xe2\x80\x99s distaste for Lannisters and seems intent on making Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s journey north as uncomfortable as possible. However, Tyrion does take a small bit of revenge when he accepts a tattered old bearskin cloak from Benjen, a gift Tyrion thinks Benjen did not expect him to accept and is probably regretting.\n\nBy the eighteenth night of their journey the inns and settlements have long since disappeared, forcing the party to make camp. Being too small to help, Tyrion (as is his custom) goes away from the camp with a book about [[dragons]], one of several brought with him from Winterfell. Tyrion has always been interested in dragons. He remembers seeking out the dragon skulls in [[King\'s Landing]] the first time he was there. He recalls having a torch with him when he discovered the skulls and having the sensation that they seemed to like it when he put his torch to them. There were three skulls much larger than the others and one of the skulls could have swallowed a mammoth whole.  Tyrion recalls that King [[Loren Lannister|Loren I]], an ancestor of the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]], had been about to defeat [[Aegon I Targaryen]] in battle when the Targaryens [[Field of Fire|unleashed]] all three of their dragons and made short work of their opponents.\n\nAs Tyrion reads he is approached by Jon Snow, who asks why he reads so much. Tyrion explains that because his body is twisted and weak he must rely on his mind and that a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. When Jon asks what Tyrion is reading, Tyrion begins to explain about dragons and how he fantasized about them as a child when feeling resentful toward his family.\n\n[[File:Tyrion mind needs books.jpg|left|250px|thumb|&quot;A mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone.&quot; ([[Game of Thrones|TV series]])]]\n\nWhen Tyrion goes so far as to suggest that Jon must feel resentment towards his own family, Jon protests. However Tyrion continues to push the issue, sarcastically describing how Lady [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] treats him as one of her own, how [[Robb Stark|Robb]] is kind because he is the heir, and how Eddard Stark must have had a good reason to pack Jon off to the [[Wall]]. When Jon replies that the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch is a noble calling, Tyrion describes the Watch as a midden heap for the realm\xe2\x80\x99s debtors, poachers, rapers, thieves, and bastards, all kept busy watching for imaginary [[grumkins]] and [[snarks]].\n\nWhen Jon asks him to stop, Tyrion realizes what he has been saying and feels badly. Reaching out to comfort Jon, he is attacked and knocked down by Jon\xe2\x80\x99s [[direwolf]], [[Ghost]]. Unable to get up on his own, Tyrion is forced to apologize to Jon before receiving help. When Tyrion questions why the wolf attacked, Jon jokes that Ghost must have mistaken Tyrion for a grumkin, which amuses them both.\n\nHaving calmed down, Jon asks Tyrion if the things he said of the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch were true. When Tyrion says yes, Jon accepts the truth grimly. The two share some wine and return to camp for a supper of squirrel stew. Tyrion is the last to retire, and Jon has the first watch.\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Benjen Stark]]\n*[[Ghost]]\n*[[Jon Snow]]\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Jyck]]\n*[[Morrec]]\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Yoren]]\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]]\n*[[Balerion]]\n*[[Catelyn Tully]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n*[[Loren Lannister]]\n*[[Luwin]]\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Meraxes]]\n*[[Mern Gardener]]\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n*[[Vhaghar]]\n|}\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[Casterly Rock]]\n*[[Dragonstone]]\n*[[Fingers]]\n*[[King\'s Landing]]\n*[[Kingsroad]]\n*[[Port of Ibben]]\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[Reach]]\n*[[Seven Kingdoms]]\n*[[Summer Isles]]\n*[[The Wall]]\n*[[Winterfell]]\n*[[Wolfswood]]\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[Direwolf]]\n*[[Dothraki]]\n*[[Dragon]]\n*[[Dragonbone]]\n*[[Field of Fire]]\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[Hand of the King]]\n*[[Holdfast]]\n*[[House Lannister|Lannister]]\n*[[Night\'s Watch]]\n*[[Others]]\n*[[House Targaryen]]\n|}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2009/05/eddard-tyrion.html Humorous review of the chapter]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/05/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-7 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/014/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{EnWikia|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 13|small=yes}}\n\n[[Category:A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 13]]\n[[Category:A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Tyrion Lannister|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 13]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in the Wolfswood]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place along the Kingsroad]]\n\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 13]]\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 14, Tyrion]][[pt:A Guerra dos Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 13]][[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\xa2\xd0\xb8\xd1\x80\xd0\xb8\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbd II]]</text>\n      <sha1>5fzdqbcuceudi4zcgcew8x61mptenqw</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 20</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5765</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>157736</id>\n      <parentid>118380</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-01-22T23:30:16Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Frernok</username>\n        <id>5007</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <comment>/*References and Notes*/ Slynt</comment>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3343">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Catelyn Tully|Catelyn]]\n| title\t\t= Catelyn III\n| place         = [[Riverrun]]\n| page\t\t= 225\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 19|Tyrion III]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 20|Catelyn III]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 21|Jaime III]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 14|Catelyn II]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 35|Catelyn IV]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Robb Stark|Robb]] stands with all his bannermen attending as the bodies of [[Willem Lannister]] and [[Tion Frey]] are laid before him.

After [[Catelyn Tully|Catelyn]] released Ser [[Jaime Lannister]] from captivity, he and his men murdered Willem Lannister and Tion Frey in their cells at [[Riverrun]], killing two guards in the process. Robb orders Rickard\'s accomplices to be hanged and sentences Rickard to death, knowing that he must perform the execution himself, as both the [[House Stark|Starks]] and [[House Karstark|Karstarks]] are descended from the [[First Men]]. \n\nThe rest of the Karstark men had already departed Riverrun to seek out and kill Jaime Lannister, also offering gold and the hand of [[Alys Karstark|Rickard\'s daughter]] in marriage to anyone who could turn the Kingslayer over to them. [[Edmure Tully|Edmure]] urges Robb to hold Lord Karstark hostage and not to let word get out to the [[House Frey|Freys]] or [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] about the deaths of the two squires. But Robb feels he has been betrayed by the murder and has no choice but to kill the man whose two sons died defending his life. Robb carries out the sentence in the [[godswood]]. That night, [[Jeyne Westerling|Jeyne]] comes to Catelyn for advice in comforting Robb, and the young woman promises that she will soon bear Robb\'s son if the gods answer her prayers.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Willem Lannister]]\n*[[Tion Frey]]\n*[[Jon Umber (Greatjon)]]\n*[[Rickard Karstark]]\n*[[Catelyn Tully]]\n*[[Jaime Lannister]] Kingslayer\n*[[Alys Karstark]]\n*[[Edmure Tully]]\n*[[Jeyne Westerling]]\n}}\t\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Riverrun]]\n*[[House Stark]]\n*[[House Karstark]]\n*[[First Men]]\n*[[House Frey]]\n*[[House Lannister]]\n*[[Godswood]]\n}}\n\n\n==References and Notes==\n* The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n* [http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/12/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-12 A first-time reader\'s summary and commentary] of the chapter, by Leigh Butler.\n* [http://slynt.blogspot.nl/2013/03/re-read-catelyn-iii-to-end-nights-dark.html Re-read Catelyn III: To End the Night\'s Dark Dance].

Arya has been kept busy delivering messages for Weese, and she wants to find [[Jaqen H\'ghar]] before he leaves. She finally finds Jaqen and gives him Weese\xe2\x80\x99s name. As she watches [[Tywin Lannister]] lead his host out of the castle, she realizes that she has been targeting the wrong people, people who really do not matter. She goes in search of Jaqen, but finds Weese\xe2\x80\x99s dead body first.\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:Acok addam marbrand by o0magnus.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Lannister host marching out]]\nThe Castle is in an uproar with preparations for [[Tywin Lannister]]\xe2\x80\x99s host\xe2\x80\x99s departure. Ser [[Addam Marbrand]] was the first to depart, a day before the rest. [[Weese]] calls Ser Addam a great horseman and sword fighter, and Lord Tywin\xe2\x80\x99s most daring commander. Arya hopes Ser Addam and all his men die. She is sure that they are going to fight [[Robb Stark]], and wonders what Robb has accomplished.\n\nArya has been kept busy running messages from dawn to dust. She has even delivered messages beyond the wall, and considered running away except that Weese told her he would deliver her to [[Vargo Hoat]]; maybe if Weese were dead. Weese does not know Arya can read, so he never seals his messages. That day, she delivers a message demanding payment for a debt to a knight who cannot read. She reads it to him, and he tries to hit her so she takes a silver banded drinking horn from him and flees, giving it to Weese. For this Arya is promised the reward of sharing a crisp capron with Weese that night. As she runs errands, she searches for [[Jaqen H\'ghar]] to give him another name before he leaves. She finally asks a gate guard and is told that Ser [[Amory Lorch]] is to be castellan of [[Harrenhal]], so Jaqen will not be leaving. The [[Brave Companions]] will also be left to do foraging. Unfortunately, the Mountain will be leaving to command Tywin\xe2\x80\x99s van in battle,  putting him, [[Dunsen]], [[Polliver]], and [[Rafford]] beyond reach.\n\nWeese gives Arya a message for [[Lucan]] that Ser [[Lyonel (knight)|Lyonel]], who is to ride with [[Kevan Lannister]], needs a new sword. When she reaches the armory she spies [[Gendry]] and asks him which one of the men is Lucan, he tells her that [[Hot Pie]] asked him if he heard her scream [[Winterfell]] when they were fighting on the wall. Arya immediately claims she didn\xe2\x80\x99t and Gendry tells her she did, but that he told Hot Pie he needs to clean out his ears because she yelled \xe2\x80\x9cGo to hell\xe2\x80\x9d and she better have the same story; she does not want Hot Pie to know who she really is, and thinks maybe she should give Jaqen his name. Gendry gets Lucan, who pulls down a longsword and gives it to Arya with the message that it is too good for such an oaf. Arya claims she will pass on the message, but will not because Weese would beat her bloody. The longsword feels good in Arya\xe2\x80\x99s hand, although a lot heavier than [[Needle]], and she thinks that she may not be a [[Water Dancer]] but she is not a mouse either. She considers using the note to get a horse, pretending she is doing it for Ser Lyonel since the stableboys are not able to read. \n\nShe is trying to decide whether to take the chance when she overhears some archers talk. One says that Robb brought giants from the north, another that Starks are more like wolves than men, and then one states that Robb is scared to attack Harrenhal, and would piss in his pants if he knew they were coming. One man comments that maybe they are the ones that should run. She thinks that yes, they should run or her brother will kill them. She is interrupted by Weese, who has come up in front of her and she did not see him. He complains that she took long enough, and snatches the sword from her, slapping her with the back of his hand and telling her next time she will be faster. She was a wolf and suddenly is not. He asks her if she wants another slap, and tells her he wants none of her insolent looks, and to tell [[Tuffleberry]] he has barrels for him but he needs to send lads to fetch them. He then warns her to run if she wants to eat tonight, and not to get lost again or she will be beat bloody.\n[[File:Mustamirri Second Name.JPG|[[Arya Stark]] names [[Weese]]. \xc2\xa9 Mustamirri |thumb|300px|right]]\nHalfway to the brewhouse, she runs into [[Rorge]] and three other of Ser Amory\xe2\x80\x99s men. He calls her \xe2\x80\x9cYoren\xe2\x80\x99s little cunt\xe2\x80\x9d and recalls that he promised to fuck her with her stick, saying she is no longer so brave now that he is not wearing chains. When she tells him she is looking for Jaqen, she can see something in his eyes, possibly fear. He tells her he is in the bathhouse and to get out of his way. In the bathhouse, she tries to sneak up on Jaqen, but he knows she is there, telling her the scuff of leather on stone is as loud as warhorns to a man with open ears, and clever girls go barefoot. She is upset that he heard her, and whispers Weese\xe2\x80\x99s name in his ear. He states that a man will attend him at his leisure.\n\nShe gives Tuffleberry the message and he curses, saying his lads are busy and that he will have those barrels within an hour, or Lord Tywin will hear of it. Weese is not happy about this message, but finds six men.\n\nSupper is a thin stew, and Weese shares his capon with a woman who has been sleeping with him. When he sees Arya staring, he reminds her he told her what would happen if he caught her staring. He slaps her, then shoves her and her dress catches on a loose nail and rips. Weese commands her to fix that before she sleeps.\n\nShe is kicked awake in the morning by Weese, who tells them that the work will not get easier now that Tywin\xe2\x80\x99s host is gone. Later, Arya watches as Lord Tywin and Ser Kevan pass, followed by their great lords and captains. Last comes [[Gregor Clegane]], with [[Polliver]] beside him wearing Gendry\xe2\x80\x99s helmet. Suddenly Arya realizes she was stupid and that neither [[Chiswyck]] nor [[Weese]] mattered. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t she say Lord Tywin? She hurries to find Jaqen to tell him.\n\nShe hears a shriek of pain, and finds a dozen people looking at the body of Weese with his ugly dog on his chest. Every so often the dog  rips a mouthful of flesh off his face. One man exclaims that he had that bitch since it was pup, and it must be [[Harren Hoare|Harren\xe2\x80\x99s]] ghost. When Arya lifts her gaze, she sees Jaqen on the battlements, who casually lays two fingers across his cheek.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n*Summary and analyses of the chapter [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2012/01/re-read-arya-viii-hassle-with-oversized.html in the course of a 10th reread].\n* [http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/05/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-18 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 38]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Arya Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Harrenhal]]\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 38]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 39, Arya]]</text>\n      <sha1>j7t9r3ra8nu8kojj42zatom57syqmzj</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Clash of Kings-Chapter 32</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6163</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>177785</id>\n      <parentid>166435</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-12-23T16:12:23Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Nittanian</username>\n        <id>3504</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9966">{{Infobox Chapter ACfK\n| pov\t\t= [[Sansa Stark]]\n| place         = [[King\'s Landing]]\n| title\t\t= Sansa III\n| page\t\t= 355\n| previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 31|Catelyn III]]\n| current\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 32|Sansa III]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 33|Catelyn IV]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 18|Sansa II]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 52|Sansa IV]]\n}}\n\n[[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] is called before [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] to pay for her brother [[Robb Stark]]\xe2\x80\x99s latest [[Battle of Oxcross|victory]]. Sansa is being beaten by [[Boros Blount]] when [[Tyrion Lannister]] arrives. He stops the beating and has her taken to the [[Tower of the Hand]] to be cleaned up and treated. The next morning he offers her protection, but she refuses.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Sandor Clegane]] is telling [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] that if she keeps [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] waiting it will only be worse. As Sansa is making herself pretty for Joffrey, she wonders if Joffrey has heard about her meetings with Ser [[Dontos Hollard|Dontos]]. As they are walking, Sansa asks the [[Hound]] what she has done and is told that it is what her kingly brother [[Robb Stark]] has done. Sansa tells the Hound that Robb is the traitor and she had no part; she can only think that if Robb harmed [[Jaime Lannister]] she will have to face Ser [[Ilyn Payne]]. The Hound tells her again that they trained her well, calling her a little bird.\n\nShe is led to the lower bailey where a crowd is gathered. She can hear Lord [[Gyles Rosby]] coughing as they part to let her pass. Ser [[Horas Redwyne]] and [[Hobber Redwyne]] avoid her gaze as she passes. There is a cat shot by a bolt mewling on the ground. Ser Dontos, riding a broomstick as commanded by the king, whispers to her to \xe2\x80\x9cBe brave.\xe2\x80\x9d In the center stands Joffrey with Ser [[Boros Blount]] and Ser [[Meryn Trant]] beside him. She kneels before him, but Joffrey snaps that kneeling will not save her and she must answer for her brother\xe2\x80\x99s treasons. She is slow to get up, and the Hound, not ungently, pulls her up when commanded.\n\nSer [[Lancel Lannister]] now speaks to her, claiming that Robb fell upon Ser [[Stafford Lannister]] with an army of [[Skinchanger|wargs]] near [[Lannisport]], using some [[Magic|sorcery]]. Thousands of men were butchered as they slept. According to Lancel, the [[north]]men feasted on their flesh after the slaughter.\n\nJoffrey asks if she has anything to say. Ser Dontos tells him that she is shocked witless. Joffrey then brings up that her [[direwolf]]  savaged him, and Sansa retorts that it was [[Arya Stark|Arya]]\'s wolf ([[Nymeria (direwolf)|Nymeria]]), and that he killed [[Lady (direwolf)|Lady]] even though she never hurt him. Joffrey replies that it was [[Eddard Stark]] that killed Lady, and he killed him. Joffrey then recounts how he shot a man in the throat at the gates that was bigger than her father. He would shoot her also but [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] says they will kill [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]. He then commands the Hound to hit Sansa, but Ser Dontos intervenes by wacking her over the head with his morning star\xe2\x80\x94a melon on the end of a stick. People are laughing, but, despite Sansa\xe2\x80\x99s prayers, Joffrey does not. Instead he calls to his [[Kingsguard]], telling them to save her face. Ser [[Meryn Trant]] flings Dontos down while Ser Boros first slams a fist into Sansa\xe2\x80\x99s belly, and then starts to lay the flat of his blade across her thighs. The Hound rasps \xe2\x80\x9cEnough,\xe2\x80\x9d but the king orders Boros to make her naked and he tears the silk of her bodice away exposing her breasts. She can hear sniggers as Joffery orders her beat bloody.\n\nAt that point, a voice demands \'\'&quot;What is the meaning of this?&quot;\'\'. Sansa looks to see the arrival of a furious [[Tyrion Lannister]], flanked by [[Bronn|his sellsword]] and [[Timett|one of his tribesmen]] who demands Blount tell him what sort of [[knight]] beats helpless maids. Ser Boros replies one that serves his king, drawing his sword, with Ser Meryn stepping beside him. Bronn warns them to be careful, as they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get blood all over their white cloaks. Tryion asks for someone to give Sansa something to cover herself with, and Sandor tosses her his cloak. Tyrion then asks Joffrey whether he has no regard for her honor, considering that she is to be his queen one day. Joffrey replies that he is punishing her for having the blood of the wolf, and Tyrion replies that Joffrey has the wits of a goose. Joffrey insists that the king can do as he likes, and Tyrion asks if he knows what happened to [[Aerys II Targaryen]], who also did what he liked. Ser Boros warns Tyrion that no one is to threaten the king, but Tyrion responds he is only educating him, and then tells Bronn and Timett to kill Ser Boros if he opens his mouth again. \n\nWhen Ser Boros, turning red, states the queen will hear of this, Tyrion asks if they should send for Cersei. When Joffrey has nothing to say, Tyrion tells him to learn to use his ears more and his mouth less, lest his reign be shorter than Tyrion himself. He points out that brutality will not win his people\xe2\x80\x99s love, nor his queen\xe2\x80\x99s. Joffrey replies that Cersei taught him to value fear over love, and Sansa fears him. Tyrion only notes that it is a pity [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] and [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]] are not twelve year-old girls as well.\n\nTyrion then continues by ordering Bronn and Timett to bring Sansa. They take her to the [[Tower of the Hand]]. She is shaking and moving as if she were in a dream. Serving girls clean her up and Maester [[Frenken]] treats her wounds. Sansa thinks how the Hound hated knights, and now she hates them also, and she does not believe they are true knights. She sleeps.\n\nShe wakes that night and her legs pain her when she gets up. Outside her door, she finds [[Chella|a woman]] whom she tells she wants to go to the [[godswood]]; she wants to find Ser Dontos and beg him to take her home before it is too late. The woman tells her that Tyrion said she was not to leave. When food comes in the morning she tells the servant to take it away. Later, Tyrion arrives and tells her that she is a guest, not a prisoner.\n\nTyrion then tells the story of Robb\xe2\x80\x99s victory. Ser Stafford\xe2\x80\x99s host was encamped outside [[Oxcross]]. He explains that there were no army of wargs or sorcery involved as Ser Lancel claimed, as Lancel wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know a warg from a wart and according to Tyrion, \'\'&quot;sorcery is the sauce men spoon over failure to hide the flavor of their own incompetence&quot;\'\'. Robb\xe2\x80\x99s soldiers crept into the camp and cut the horse lines, and then Robb sent his [[Grey Wind|direwolf]] among them, causing a stampede. The panicked horses trampled the camp, killing many. Most of the rest fled in terror, casting aside their weapons. Among the dead are Ser Stafford (killed by Lord [[Rickard Karstark]]), Ser [[Rupert Brax]], Ser [[Lymond Vikary]], Lord [[Roland Crakehall|Crakehall]], and Lord [[Antario Jast]]. Fifty have been taken prisoner including Jast\xe2\x80\x99s sons and [[Martyn Lannister]]. The incompetent Ser Stafford had not even bothered to post sentries, thinking himself safe and secure in the Westerlands and most of his army were raw recruits, the sweepings of [[Lannisport]]. The only mystery is how Robb reached Oxcross since [[House Lannister|Lannister]] forces hold the [[Golden Tooth]] and the men stationed there swear Robb didn\'t pass them. Tyrion ultimately declares it unimportant; Robb Stark is [[Tywin Lannister|his father]]\'s problem, while Joffrey is his.\n\nTyrion then asks Sansa how she feels about his nephew and she responds that she loves him with all her heart, more than ever. Tyrion is amused and tells her someone taught her to lie well, which she may be grateful for one day. He then asks if she has flowered, to which she answers no. He says that is good, and that he does not intend for her to marry Joffrey, since there will never be a reconciliation between the Lannisters and [[House Stark|Starks]] with the way Joffrey has acted, calling it a pity as the marriage was one of [[Robert I Baratheon]]\xe2\x80\x99s better notions. Sansa is concerned that this is a trick and states she only wants to be loyal. Tyrion adds &quot;...and far from any Lannisters&quot;, but admits he cannot blame her, as when he was her age, he wanted the same thing. \n\nHe then notes that she visits the godswood every day and asks what she prays for. Sansa prays for Robb\xe2\x80\x99s victory and Joffrey\xe2\x80\x99s death, but claims she prays for an end to the fighting. Tyrion tells her there will be another battle between Robb and [[Tywin Lannister]] and that will settle the issue, warning her not to think that Oxcross was significant, and to pray that her brother bends his knee, and he will return her to [[Winterfell]] once there is peace. He offers to have some of his [[Vale mountain clans|clansmen]] guard her, maybe [[Chella]] if she prefers a woman. Sansa, thinking about Ser Dontos rescuing her, tells him that the wildlings frighten her. He responds that they also frighten Joffrey and the lickspittles and sycophants who make up his Kingsguard so no one would harm her. When she tells him she would prefer sleeping in her own bed and the tower is where her father\xe2\x80\x99s men were slain, and their ghosts give her bad dreams, he agrees to have her escorted back to her bedchamber.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n*Summary and analyses of the chapter [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2011/12/re-read-sansa-iii-slapping-me-softly.html in the course of a 10th reread].\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/04/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-15 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 32]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Sansa Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 32]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 33, Sansa]]\n[[zh:\xe5\x88\x97\xe7\x8e\x8b\xe7\x9a\x84\xe7\xba\xb7\xe4\xba\x89-\xe7\xab\xa0\xe8\x8a\x82 32]]</text>\n      <sha1>6c8ygkfwmsd9qxddquprmh59j6rvebg</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Game of Thrones-Chapter 15</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>3550</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>165958</id>\n      <parentid>127605</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-17T14:11:42Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8224">{{Infobox Chapter AGoT\n| pov\t\t= [[Sansa Stark]]\n| place         = [[inn at the crossroads]]&lt;br&gt;near the [[ruby ford]]\n| title\t\t= Sansa I\n| page\t\t= \n| previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 14|Catelyn III]]\n| current\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 15|Sansa I]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 16|Eddard III]]\n| arc previous\t= \n| arc next\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 29|Sansa II]]\n}} __NOTOC__\n\nAfter exploring the camp, [[Sansa Stark]] goes riding with her betrothed, Prince [[Joffrey]]. Near the [[ruby ford]], they come upon [[Arya Stark]] and a [[Mycah|butcher\'s boy]] play-fighting. Joffrey begins to torment the boy until Arya attacks him.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] is having breakfast with [[Septa]] [[Mordane]] in an [[inn at the crossroads|inn]] near the [[Trident]]. When Sansa feeds her [[direwolf]] [[Lady (direwolf)|Lady]] under the table, the septa says that although Sansa is a good girl she is as willful as her sister Arya when it comes to her direwolf.\n\nThe septa informs Sansa that they have been invited to ride in the wheelhouse with Queen [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] and Princess [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]]. Sansa has been looking forward to this for a week, hoping for a chance to be with Prince [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]]. Joffrey is everything she ever wanted her prince to be like: tall and strong and handsome.  The one thing Sansa is afraid of is that Arya will ruin everything for her. Septa Mordane wants Sansa and Arya to dress well for the event and Sansa has already decided on a fine silk dress. She does not expect Arya to wear anything appropriate. Sansa begs to be excused so she can look for Arya.\n\nShe finds Arya on the banks of the Trident, trying to comb the mud out of her direwolf [[Nymeria (direwolf)|Nymeria]]\xe2\x80\x99s fur. Arya is not interested in riding in the wheelhouse, and intends to go riding with [[Mycah]] to look for [[Ruby Ford|rubies]] in the river. Sansa insists that there is no fun in riding because there is nothing to see, but Arya is fascinated by all the new flowers and landmarks and people they are seeing along the way. Sansa informs Arya that she has to come, asking why anyone would want to ride a stinky horse when they could ride in the wheelhouse on pillows while eating lemon cakes and keeping company with the queen. Arya replies that she does not even like the queen and still intends to go riding. Sansa, giving up, leaves but Arya yells after her that Lady will not be allowed in the wheelhouse, which leaves Sansa speechless. \n\nWhen she nears the camp, Sansa sees a crowd gathered around the wheelhouse; the [[Small Council|council]] has sent an honor guard from [[King\'s Landing]] to accompany them the rest of the way. The party includes two knights in fine armour: a strong old man in white armor and a beautiful young man in green armor. There is also a gaunt, grim man that Sansa finds so terrifying that she backs right into [[Sandor Clegane]]. Sansa kneels and hugs Lady and, next thing she knows, the two new arrivals are standing above her. Joffrey explains that the terrifying man is Ser [[Ilyn Payne]], the King\xe2\x80\x99s Justice (the royal executioner).\n\nThe white knight then introduces himself as Ser [[Barristan Selmy]], Lord Commander of the [[Kingsguard]], but the green knight insists that she guess. Based on his age and his antlered helm, Sansa correctly deduces him to be the king\xe2\x80\x99s youngest brother, Lord [[Renly Baratheon]]. Feeling more comfortable, Sansa apologizes to Ser Ilyn Payne, but the man does not speak. Once he has left, Joffrey explains that his tongue was ripped out by [[Aerys II Targaryen|Mad King Aerys]].\n\nThe Queen says that she must speak with the councilors, and therefore must postpone the day with Myrcella. Instead, she asks Joffrey to entertain their guests\xe2\x80\x94Sansa is overjoyed with the idea of a whole day with Joffrey. Sansa offers to do whatever the prince wants, and when Joffrey suggest they go riding, Sansa gushes that she loves riding. Joffrey then suggests that it would be best to leave Lady and his dog, Sandor Clegane, behind. When Sansa questions leaving Clegane behind Joffrey brandishes his sword, [[Lion\'s Tooth]].\n\n[[File:Thomas Denmark lions tooth.jpg|400px|thumb|Arya picks up [[Lion\'s Tooth]] while Joffrey lies whimpering on the ground - by [http://thomasdenmarkportfolio.blogspot.com/ Thomas Denmark].\xc2\xa9 Fantasy Flight Games]] \n\nThey ride along the river, exploring the countryside until they draw near to the [[Battle of the Trident|battlefield]] where King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] defeated [[Rhaegar Targaryen]]. Then they hear an odd sound, like wooden clattering, coming from nearby. In a nearby clearing, they find a boy and a girl play-fighting with sticks. The boy, taller and older than the girl, is winning. When the girl is disarmed by a smack on the hand, Sansa recognizes her as Arya. Joffrey laughs and the boy, a butcher\xe2\x80\x99s boy named [[Mycah]], drops his stick. Joffrey begins to taunt Mycah and challenges him to a fight, sword against stick. Mycah insists that Arya asked him to fight her, which Sansa quickly realizes is the truth. Joffrey remains oblivious however, and goes so far as to prick the boy\xe2\x80\x99s cheek with his sword. Arya picks up her stick and tells Joffrey to leave Mycah alone. Joffrey insists that he will not hurt Mycah, much.\n\nWithout warning, Arya breaks her stick over the back of Joffrey\xe2\x80\x99s head. Mycah runs away while an enraged Joffrey staggers but manages to catch a second blow from Arya on his sword, knocking the splintered stick from her hand. Ignoring Sansa\xe2\x80\x99s screams for them to stop, Arya throws a rock and hits Joffrey\xe2\x80\x99s horse, driving it away. Joffrey chases Arya with his sword until she is backed up against a tree. Suddenly Nymeria appears, savaging Joffrey\xe2\x80\x99s sword arm and forcing him to drop his sword. Arya calls Nymeria off and picks up Lion\xe2\x80\x99s Tooth while Joffrey lies whimpering on the ground. The prince pleads to Arya not to hurt him. Arya throws the sword into the river before running off with Nymeria.\n\nOnce Arya is gone, Sansa goes to help Joffrey tenderly, but he snarls at her to leave and not touch him and Sansa can see the contempt in his eyes.\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Arya Stark]]\n*[[Barristan Selmy]]\n*[[Cersei Lannister]]\n*[[Ilyn Payne]]\n*[[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n*[[Lady (direwolf)|Lady]]\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Mordane]]\n*[[Mycah]]\n*[[Nymeria (direwolf)|Nymeria]]\n*[[Renly Baratheon]]\n*[[Sandor Clegane]]\n*[[Sansa Stark]]\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentionned:\'\'\'\n*[[Aemon Targaryen]]\n*[[Aerys II Targaryen]]\n*Princess [[Daeryssa]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n*[[Jaime Lannister]]\n*[[Jon Snow]]\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentionned:\'\'\'\n*[[Morgil]]\n*[[Myrcella Baratheon]]\n*[[Naerys Targaryen]]\n*[[Rhaegar Targaryen]]\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n*[[Serwyn]]\n|}\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[King\'s Landing]]\n*[[Kingsroad]]\n*[[The Neck]]\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[Storm\'s End]]\n*[[Trident]]\n*[[Winterfell]]\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[Aurochs]]\n*[[Direwolf]]\n*[[Kingsguard]]\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[Lion\'s Tooth]]\n*[[Lizard-lion]]\n*[[Poison kisses]]\n*[[House Stark]]\n|}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2009/05/catelyn-sansa.html Humorous review of the chapter]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/05/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-8 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/016/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{EnWikia|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 15|small=yes}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 15]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Sansa Stark|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 15]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place by the Trident]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place along the Kingsroad]]\n\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 15]]\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 16, Sansa]][[pt:A Guerra dos Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 15]][[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\xa1\xd0\xb0\xd0\xbd\xd1\x81\xd0\xb0 I]]</text>\n      <sha1>5pn4amzyjbstdlmr0x9m1wlxdlgybhf</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 12</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5759</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>99342</id>\n      <parentid>97276</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2013-06-22T16:13:43Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Visen</username>\n        <id>5916</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2894">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]]\n| place         = [[King\'s Landing]]\n| title\t\t= Tyrion II\n| page\t\t= 132\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 11|Jaime II]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 12|Tyrion II]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 13|Arya II]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 4|Tyrion I]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 19|Tyrion III]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] is waiting in [[Varys]]\xe2\x80\x99 room when the eunuch walks in.

He finds out that [[Boros Blount]] has been restored to the [[Kingsguard]], and that [[Mandon Moore]] had been brought to [[King\'s Landing]] by [[Jon Arryn]]. Tyrion asks Varys to bring [[Shae]] to the eunuch\xe2\x80\x99s chambers so that no one will notice their meeting. He realizes that he cannot trust Varys any further, but hopes to use him this one last time. When he meets Shae, he means to send her away to protect her from his father, but Tyrion once again cannot bear to part with her.

Their governess, [[Septa]] [[Mordane]], coos over Princess [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]]\'s needlework, which Arya thinks is also crooked. Sansa is whispering with [[Jeyne Poole]] and [[Beth Cassel]]. When Arya asks what they are whispering about she is told it is about how handsome Prince Joffrey is, and that he has complimented Sansa and is going to marry her. Arya points out that [[Jon Snow]] thinks Joffrey looks like a girl. Sansa laments that Jon gets jealous because he is a [[bastard]] but Arya defends him, drawing the septa\'s attention to her. \n\nSepta Mordane inspects Arya\'s stitches and pronounces her dissatisfaction. Humiliated, Arya bolts for the door, stopping only long enough to be forced to bow to Princess Myrcella. Arya wishes she had some of her sister\'s skill and beauty. She has her father\xe2\x80\x99s looks, not the beauty of their mother like Sansa. Jeyne used to call her &quot;Horseface&quot;, which was all the more hurtful because the only thing that Arya could do better than Sansa was ride. That and manage a household since Sansa has no head for figures. \n\nArya finds her direwolf pup [[Nymeria]] waiting for her and together they go to watch the boys sparring in the practice yard, not daring to go back to her room where she would be found and punished. On the covered bridge overlooking the yard, Arya comes across Jon Snow seated on a sill with [[Ghost]], watching the fighting below. She sits down beside him and they watch together.\n\nIn the yard below, heavily-padded [[Bran Stark|Bran]] and Prince [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] are fighting each other with wooden swords under the watchful eye of Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]], the master-at-arms.  The group of spectators includes [[Robb Stark|Robb]] and [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]]. Jon comments that swords are a bit more exhausting than needlework, but Arya responds that they are also more fun. Arya remembers thinking when she was little that she was a bastard like Jon because they were the only children to take after their father. When Arya asks why Jon is not down in the yard with the others, Jon explains that bastards are not allowed to damage princes, only trueborn swords can do that. Arya says she could fight as well as Bran who is only seven while she is nine, but Jon says she doesn\'t have enough strength for a longsword. \n\n[[File:John Matson Joff.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Prince Joffrey gives his mother\'s sigil equal place.]]\n\nJon points out that the newly-arrived Prince [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffery]] is wearing a sigil that has both the stag and lion on it, giving his [[Cersei Lannister|mother]]\xe2\x80\x99s [[House Lannister|Lannister]] sigil equality to the royal [[House Baratheon|Baratheon]] sigil. Jon suggests that Arya should wear a combination sigil for the [[House Stark|Stark]]s and [[House Tully|Tully]]s, but Arya jokes that a wolf with a trout in its mouth would look silly. She questions why a girl would need a sigil if she isn\'t allowed to fight. Jon shrugs that girls get the sigils but not the swords, while bastards get the swords but not the sigils.\n\nBelow, Bran has knocked Tommen down and Ser Rodrik calls Robb and Joffrey for a bout. Joffrey acts as if it is beneath his dignity to fight Starks with practice swords. He suggests real swords and Robb readily accepts. Jon comments to Arya that Joffrey truly is a &quot;little shit&quot;. Ser Rodrik states that he will only allow blunted tourney swords. Joffrey\'s scarred bodyguard [[Sandor Clegane]] remarks that he killed a man with a real sword when he was only twelve. Joffrey makes a few more condescending remarks that enrage Robb, then feigns a yawn and leaves with Tommen. Jon encourages Arya to go to her room and face her punishment. Arya insists it is not fair, but Jon says that nothing is fair as he walks away with Ghost. Arya returns to her room to find not only Septa Mordane, but also her mother.\n\n==Character List Appearing/Mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Arya Stark]]\n*[[Beth Cassel]]\n*[[Bran Stark]]\n*[[Catelyn Stark]]\n*[[Donnis]]\n*[[Ghost]]\n\n*[[Jeyne Poole]]\n*[[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n*[[Jon Snow]]\n*[[Lew (guard)|Lew]]\n*[[Mordane]]\n*[[Myrcella Baratheon]]\n\n*[[Nymeria (direwolf)|Nymeria]]\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Rodrik Cassel]]\n*[[Sandor Clegane]]\n*[[Sansa Stark]]\n*[[Theon Greyjoy]]\n*[[Tommen Baratheon]]\n\n*[[Lady (direwolf)|Lady]]\n*[[Nymeria]]\n*[[Rickon Stark]]\n}}\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Winterfell]]\n\n*[[House Baratheon]]\n*[[House Cassel]]\n*[[House Greyjoy]]\n\n*[[House Lannister]]\n*[[House Poole]]\n*[[Rhoynar|Rhoyne]]\n\n*[[Faith of the Seven|Septa]]\n*[[House Stark]]\n*[[House Tully]]\n}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2009/05/catelyn-arya.html Humorous review of the chapter]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/04/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-4 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/008/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 07]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Arya Stark|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 07]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Winterfell]]\n\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 08, Arya]]\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 7]][[pt:A Guerra dos Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 7]][[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\x90\xd1\x80\xd1\x8c\xd1\x8f I]]</text>\n      <sha1>mbvz1n68rpjy7g2vev47h753kmlp6kx</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 14</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6820</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166546</id>\n      <parentid>107374</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-25T15:11:54Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3695">{{Infobox Chapter ADwD\n| pov\t\t= [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n| place         = [[Rhoyne]]\n| title\t\t= Tyrion IV\n| page\t\t= 179\n| previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 13|Bran II]]\n| current\t= Tyrion IV\n| next\t\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 15|Davos II]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 8|Tyrion III]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 18|Tyrion V]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\nAboard the \'\'[[Shy Maid]]\'\', [[Griff]] has banned [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]], who is still playing the role of Hugor Hill, from drinking wine as they journey down the [[Rhoyne]]. Septa [[Lemore]] bathes naked every morning in the river, much to Tyrion\'s delight, but he notes she is not as virginal as she appears - Tyrion notices that she has stretch marks from childbirth. \n\nAfter they all break their fast with [[Yandry]] and [[Ysilla]], [[Rolly Duckfield|Duck]] begins training [[purple eyes|purple-eyed]] [[Young Griff]] with swords. Griff shoulder-charges Duck into the river, and when Tyrion laughs at him he chucks him overboard.

She is brought before her son to explain why she released [[Jaime Lannister]]. [[Rickard Karstark]], whose sons [[Eddard Karstark|Eddard]] and [[Torrhen Karstark|Torrhen]] were killed by Jaime, is angry at her but Robb is more gentle and acknowledges that &quot;love is not always wise&quot;. Thinking about her daughters whom she had hoped to trade for Ser Jaime, Catelyn agrees. Lord Karstark, however, is unappeased and leaves the room in a fury. \n\nIn privacy, Robb introduces his mother to his new bride. Catelyn immediately realizes that, as Robb was pledged to marry a Frey, he has insulted the Freys and broken the alliance. But with his &quot;love is not always wise&quot; speech Robb has made it impossible to blame him, as Catelyn disobeyed him because of her love for her daughters.\n\nRobb tells her how he met his wife. He had taken a wound storming [[the Crag]], and [[Jeyne Westerling|Jeyne]] nursed him back to health. The night he was told his brothers were murdered, Jeyne consoled him and they slept together. Robb married her the next morning. As the [[House Westerling|Westerings]] were vassals of [[House Lannister]], Jeyne has taken her family with her to escape the revenge of the Lannisters. Catelyn notices that [[Grey Wind]] is not with her son, because Jeyne is afraid of the wolf, and the beast growls whenever her uncle, [[Rolph Spicer]], is near. Catelyn does not like that and convinces him to send Ser Rolph off on some errand, for Grey Wind should always be near him. She considers what it may take to appease Lord [[Walder Frey]] after this slight. The loss of the Freys is strongly felt by Robb, and there was nothing that could be done when [[Ryman Frey|Ryman]] and [[Walder Frey (son of Ryman)|Black Walder]] led their men back to [[the Twins]]. \n\nEdmure tells [[Brynden Tully|his uncle]] about his victory against the Lannisters but the latter interrupts him and both the Blackfish and Robb berate Edmure for his actions. Edmure was told to not to engage the Lannisters because Robb wanted them to come West. His plan was to hold them there so that the Lannisters would be unable to defend [[King\'s Landing]] against [[Stannis Baratheon]]\'s invasion. Edmure\'s attack delayed [[Tywin Lannister]] long enough for messengers to reach him, allowing the Lannister host to turn around, link up with [[Mace Tyrell]]\'s army and arrive at King\'s Landing to turn the tide at the [[Battle of the Blackwater]]. Edmure ruined their whole plan, and admits that he must make amends. Robb plans to retake [[the North]], but first he must win back the Freys.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Catelyn Tully]]\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Edmure Tully]]\n*[[Jaime Lannister]]\n*[[Rickard Karstark]]\n*[[Eddard Karstark]]\n*[[Torrhen Karstark]]\n*[[Jeyne Westerling]]\n*[[Grey Wind]]\n*[[Rolph Spicer]]\n*[[Walder Frey]]\n*[[Ryman Frey]]\n*[[Walder Frey (son of Ryman)]]\n*[[Brynden Tully]] Brynden the Blackfish\n*[[Stannis Baratheon]]\n*[[Tywin Lannister]]\n*[[Mace Tyrell]]\n}}\t\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[House Frey]]\n*[[the Crag]]\n*[[House Westerling]]\n*[[House Lannister]]\n*[[The Twins]]\n*[[King\'s Landing]]\n*[[Battle of the Blackwater]]\n*[[The North]]\n}}\n\n\n==References and Notes==\n* The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/11/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-8 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Part 8]; summary and analyses of the chapter by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://slynt.blogspot.nl/2013/01/re-read-catelyn-ii-fallout-mom-and.html Catelyn II: Fallout Mom and the Leftfield King].

Uncomfortable with the warmth of the room, which is heated by hot springs beneath the castle, Ned opens the windows. As she watches him from the bed, Catelyn thinks he looks the same as when she married him and hopes they have conceived another child. \n\nThe couple discuss King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]]\'s offer, which Ned intends to refuse. Catelyn insists that he must accept so as not to offend the king, which might put them all in danger. While Catelyn contemplates the omen of the [[House Stark|direwolf]] killed by a [[House Baratheon|stag]], Ned wishes his brother [[Brandon Stark|Brandon]] had lived to be Lord of Winterfell instead.\n\nThey are interrupted by a guardsman named [[Desmond]], who says that [[Maester]] [[Luwin]] has an urgent message. The maester is shown in and explains that a carved wooden box containing a fine new glass lens was left in his observatory while he was napping. The way it was delivered made the maester wonder and he discovered a message hidden beneath a false bottom. Maester Luwin says he has not read it, and will not give it to Ned because it is addressed to Catelyn.\n\nCatelyn takes the message apprehensively. It is from her sister [[Lysa Arryn|Lysa]] and written in a secret language only the two sisters share. Catelyn immediately burns the message after reading it, but explains to Ned that the message claims [[Jon Arryn]] was murdered by Queen [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] and her [[House Lannister|family]]. Catelyn insists that now Ned \'\'must\'\' be the [[Hand of the King]], to find the truth behind Lysa\'s accusations. Maester Luwin agrees with Catelyn, pointing out that the Hand\'s authority will help determine the truth and protect Lysa and [[Robert Arryn|her son]]. Ned reminds them both that [[Rickard Stark|his father]] went south once at the summons of a king and never returned. Luwin replies that that was a different time and a different king. Catelyn insist that if Ned truly loves King Robert like a brother, he will not leave him to face the Lannisters on his own.\n\nNed then makes his decision: he will go, but Catelyn must stay behind to govern Winterfell and teach his heir [[Robb Stark|Robb]] how to be a proper lord. He allows that young [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]] may stay with her as well, but the others must come south--[[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] to wed [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], and [[Arya Stark|Arya]] to learn the ways of a southern court. Catelyn reluctantly agrees, but begs that seven-year-old [[Bran Stark|Bran]] be allowed to stay. Ned insists that Bran must bridge the gap between Robb and Joffrey. The house will be the safer for it, and Catelyn has to agree. Catelyn feels lonely already.\n\nMaester Luwin asks about [[Jon Snow]] and Catelyn\'s anger flashes. She remembers the bastard child that Ned brought back with him in the early days of their marriage. She understood Ned fathering a bastard son, but could not understand raising a bastard in the castle. There were rumors that [[Ashara Dayne]] was the boy\'s mother, but Ned forbade Catelyn to ask about it, insisting that all she needed to know was that Jon was his blood. Ned would never send Jon away though, and Catelyn could never forgive him that. Catelyn insists that Jon must leave Winterfell, but Ned argues that there will be no place for Jon at court. Maester Luwin mentions Jon\'s ambitions to join the [[Night\'s Watch]]. Ned considers this for a while and finally agrees to let Jon take the black, though not until they are ready to leave for the south; he wants Jon to enjoy his last few days. Ned decides that when it is time, he will tell Jon himself.\n\n==Character List Appearing/Mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Catelyn Tully]]\n*[[Desmond]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n*Maester [[Luwin]]\n\n*[[Aerys II Targaryen]]\n*[[Arthur Dayne]]\n*[[Arya Stark]]\n*[[Ashara Dayne]]\n*[[Benjen Stark]]\n\n*[[Brandon Stark]]\n*[[Bran Stark]]\n*[[Edmure Tully]]\n*[[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n*[[Jon Arryn]]\n*[[Jon Snow]]\n\n*[[Lysa Arryn]]\n*[[Rickon Stark]]\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n*[[Rodrik Cassel]]\n*[[Sansa Stark]]\n}}\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Dorne]]\n*[[Eyrie]]\n*[[Myr]]\n*[[Riverrun]]\n*[[Starfall]]\n*[[Summer Sea]]\n*[[Wall]]\n*[[Winterfell]]\n\n*[[House Arryn]]\n*[[House Baratheon]]\n*[[House Cassel]]\n*[[Direwolf]]\n*[[House Dayne]]\n\n*[[Hand of the King]]\n*[[Iron Throne]]\n*[[Kingsguard]]\n*[[House Lannister]]\n*[[Night\'s Watch]]\n*[[Maester]]\n\n*[[Others]]\n*[[Faith of the Seven|Sept]]\n*[[House Stark]]\n*[[Sword of the Morning]]\n*[[House Tully]]\n}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2009/05/catelyn-arya.html Humorous review of the chapter]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/04/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-4 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/007/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 06]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Catelyn Tully|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 06]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Winterfell]]\n\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 07, Catelyn]]\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 6]][[pt:A Guerra dos Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 6]][[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\x9a\xd0\xb5\xd0\xb9\xd1\x82\xd0\xb8\xd0\xbb\xd0\xb8\xd0\xbd II]]</text>\n      <sha1>ox7d6c196oz68z3k87g71j916tnpyqv</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 61</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5816</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>122050</id>\n      <parentid>98481</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2014-03-30T15:01:11Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Scafloc</username>\n        <id>28</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3204">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]]\n| title\t\t= Sansa V\n| place         = [[King\'s Landing]]\n| page\t\t= 685\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 60|Tyrion VIII]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 61|Sansa V]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 62|Jaime VII]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 59|Sansa IV]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 68|Sansa VI]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] has fled to the [[Godswood]], and when she removes her hairnet, she notices that one of the black amethysts is missing.

Dontos then appears in the godswood, and Sansa accuses him of murdering the [[Joffrey Baratheon|King]] by using one of the amethysts. Dontos denies it, telling her [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] has already been arrested for poisoning the King. She dresses under a heavy cloak, and Dontos leads her to a secret stairway down to the river. They are rowed out to a ship, and Sansa is shocked to find [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] on board. When Dontos calls for his reward of ten thousand [[Currency|gold dragons]], Littlefinger commands [[Lothor Brune]] to kill the drunk.\n\nLittlefinger explains to her that the fool sold her for a promise of gold, and once he drank that up he would sell her whereabouts to the [[Cersei Lannister|Queen]] for more gold. He reveals that it was he who wrote the note so long ago, asking her to go to the godswood. Littlefinger also planned for the dwarf jousters at the wedding, and Sansa asks him why he should wish Joffrey dead. Littlefinger responds, &quot;I had no motive. Always keep your foes confused. Sometimes the best way to baffle them is to make moves that have no purpose\xe2\x80\xa6Remember that when you come to play the game of thrones.&quot; He claims he had [[Catelyn Tully|her mother]]\'s maidenhood and tells her that she could have been his daughter, had he and Catelyn wed, and therefore he must look out for Sansa. \n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Sansa Stark]]\n*[[Dontos Hollard]]\n*[[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Petyr Baelish]] Littlefinger\n*[[Lothor Brune]]\n*[[Cersei Lannister]]\n*[[Catelyn Tully]]\n}}\t\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Godswood]]\n*[[Asshai]]\n*[[Currency|Gold Dragons]]\n}}\n\n\n==References and Notes==\n*The synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/07/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-37 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Part 37].

Beric reveals that he has trouble remembering his past, and would be unable to even find [[Blackhaven|his ancestral home]]. Thoros believes that the Lord of Light is not done with Beric yet, and that is why the red god has raised him from the dead so many times. The outlaws plan to ransom Arya back to [[Catelyn Stark|her mother]] or [[Robb Stark|brother]]. \n\nLater, [[Gendry]] joins the outlaws as a blacksmith and is [[knight]]ed by Lord Beric. Soon after, Sandor returns, claiming he killed the sentries. He demands his gold back, but is rebuffed by Thoros and commanded to leave. The [[Hound]] leaves realizing he cannot do anything, and they then discover that the sentries were only asleep.

Returning to the surface, Sam considers how hard Jon has been working the men of the [[Night\'s Watch|the Watch]]. He meets [[Edd Tollett|Dolorous Edd]], [[Pypar|Pyp]], and [[Grenn]], and they mention how much Jon has changed, acting different and barely spending any time with his friends; although he never misses a day practising his sword work. We learn that [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] has plans for [[Val]], [[Dalla]]\'s sister, seeking to use her in order to forge an alliance between the [[Wildling|wildlings]] and the [[North|northmen]]. Thus far only the [[House Karstark|Karstarks]], who have no other choice, have agreed to ally with Stannis. \n\nSam arrives at Jon\'s solar, and Jon shows him a letter he plans to send to King [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] which declares that Stannis is aiding them in their battle, but the Night\'s Watch is not sworn to his cause. They discuss how [[Melisandre]] means to sacrifice [[Mance Rayder]] for his king\'s blood, Jon states, &quot;Mance\'s blood is no more royal than mine own&quot;. He reveals to Sam that he is sending [[Gilly]] and &quot;the boy&quot; far away from the Wall. Sam tells Jon that he has uncovered little on the Others, but one book mentioned [[dragonsteel]] swords as being effective against them. However, neither is sure if dragonsteel and [[Valyrian steel]] are the same thing. \n\nJon breaks the news that he is sending Sam to the [[Citadel]] so he can train to become a [[maester]] and replace [[Aemon Targaryen (son of Maekar I)|Aemon]]. Sam will travel by sea from [[Eastwatch-by-the-sea|Eastwatch]], along with Gilly, the baby, and Maester Aemon. The thought of becoming a maester frightens Sam, bringing back memories of [[Randyll Tarly|his father]]\'s wrath when he had mentioned training at the Citadel to him when he was a boy. His father had chained him by the neck in a cell and left him there for 3 days, telling him &quot;no son of [[House Tarly]] will ever wear a chain&quot;. Lastly, Jon commands Sam to never call himself craven again. \n\nThe next morning, as the party prepares to set off for Eastwatch where they will join up with [[Dareon]], Gilly begs Jon to find a good [[wetnurse]] for the other baby.\n\n==References and Notes==\n*The synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/02/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-feast-for-crows-part-4 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Feast for Crows, Part 4].

They decide that their word for going ahead with the plan will be &quot;\'\'[[Groleo]]\'\',&quot; in reference to the hostage that was slain by the [[Yunkai\'i]]. Skahaz reveals that he was present in the throne room when [[Bloodbeard]] and the slaver lords made their insult, and that he and every one of the [[Brazen Beasts]] present would have killed the Yunkish delegation in an instant had Hizdahr given the command, raging that the Yunkish would never have dared do such a thing to Daenerys. The Shavepate goes on to explain to Ser Barristan that Hizdahr\'s horrified reaction to Groleo\'s severed head was a sham and the slavers couldn\'t care less about [[Yurkhaz zo Yunzak]]\'s death in the pit; the whole thing was arranged so as to give Hizdahr a pretext to kill the queen\'s [[dragon]]s before [[Volantis]]\'s fleet arrives.\n\nDespite Skahaz\'s objections, Barristan insists that after Hizdahr is deposed, they will order the Yunkai\'i return their remaining hostage and withdraw their armies from [[Meereen]], only going forth to do battle if they refuse. Selmy is also confident he can overcome Hizdahr\'s guards, as they are only pit fighters and Barristan believes men like that, who fight for the adulation of the crowd and only when they are called to, are no match for a knight of the [[Kingsguard]] who must always be alert and ready to fight and die at a moment\'s notice to defend their monarch.\n\nBarristan and Skahaz also dispute over trying to rescue the remaining hostages\xe2\x80\x94[[Jhogo]], [[Hero]] and [[Daario Naharis|Daario]]\xe2\x80\x94as the Shavepate believes it is too dangerous to try. He is also particularly scathing about Daario, believing it would be better in the long run for Daenerys if the [[Stormcrows]]\'s captain were to die. Though he is aware Daenerys is in love with Daario, Barristan privately agrees as he is well aware from history that the [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]] have a propensity for choosing poorly in matters of the heart, choices that almost always lead to disaster:\n\n{{Quote|\'\'Prine [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]] loved his Lady [[Lyanna Stark|Lyanna]] and [[Robert\'s Rebellion|thousands died for it]]. [[Daemon I Blackfyre|Daemon Blackfyre]] loved the [[Daenerys Targaryen (daughter of Aegon IV)|first Daenerys]], and rose in [[First Blackfyre Rebellion|rebellion]] when denied her. [[Aegor Rivers|Bittersteel]] and [[Brynden Rivers|Bloodraven]] both loved [[Shiera Seastar]] and the Seven Kingdoms bled. The [[Duncan Targaryen|Prince of Dragonflies]] loved [[Jenny (Oldstones)|Jenny of Oldstones]] so much he cast aside a crown, and Westeros paid the bride price in corpses. All three of the sons of the [[Aegon V Targaryen|fifth Aegon]] had wed for love in defiance of their father\'s wishes. And because that unlikely monarch had followed his heart when he chose his queen, he allowed his sons to have their way, making bitter enemies when he might have made fast friends. Treason and turmoil followed, as night follows day, ending at [[Summerhall]] in sorcery, fire and grief.\'\'}}\n\nSkahaz also mentions that they have hostages of their own and that they can easily retaliate in kind if the Yunkai\'i harm any more of their hostages, but like his queen, Barristan refuses to harm the cupbearers, due to his own aversion to killing children. Though disappointed, the Shavepate agrees and promises that everything will be ready for the plan by nightfall.\n\nFor the rest of the day, Barristan makes his rounds about [[Great Pyramid|the pyramid]] and trains with his boys. He thinks to himself that some of them might be ready for [[knight]]hood soon. However, as he wrestles with what he is planning to do that night, he decides it would be worse for the boys if they were knighted by an knight without honour just before his death. He lectures the boys about honor and thinks that someday maybe they will understand. He also warns [[Missandei]] not to leave the queen\'s chambers, but refuses to answer her questions about his intentions. He also reflects on his own failures, one in particular; that he didn\'t defeat Rhaegar at the [[tourney at Harrenhal]]. Had he won, he would have crowned [[Ashara Dayne]], who he was enamoured with, as [[queen of love and beauty]] and wonders that if he had, would Ashara not have killed herself from grief over a child supposedly fathered on her by [[House Stark|a Stark]]. Barristan considers that his greatest failure.\n\nDuring the night, after bathing and donning his armour, Ser Barristan goes to confront Hizdahr in his chambers; the Brazen Beasts let him past without incident. Barristan, using the pretext of delivering a message to gain entrance, tries to question Hizdahr, demanding to know if he is in league with the [[Sons of the Harpy]] and if he had anything to do with the [[Poisoned locusts|assassination attempt]] on Daenerys. Hizdahr\'s denials of the accusations do not convince Selmy, and when the old knight draws his sword, Hizdahr call for the pit fighter [[Khrazz]], one of his guards, to defend him. Despite Barristan\'s efforts to convince Khrazz to surrender, the gladiator attacks him; however, Khrazz\'s inexperience of fighting opponents wearing armour is his downfall, and Selmy kills him quickly. Barristan tells Hizdahr, who desperately begs for his life, that he means to take Hizdahr to a cell, where he will be imprisoned until Daenerys returns. Suddenly, a [[Miklaz|cup bearer]] informs them that [[Reznak mo Reznak|Reznak]] wishes to see the king. Barristan, surprised as he and Skahaz had planned to imprison Reznak as well, asks why and is told the dragons ([[Viserion]] and [[Rhaegal]]) have been loosed upon the city.\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Barristan Selmy]]\n*[[Skahaz mo Kandaq]]\n*[[Tumco Lho]]\n*[[Larraq]]/[[Larraq|The Lash]]\n*[[The Red Lamb|Red Lamb]]\n*[[Missandei]]\n*[[Steelskin]]\n*[[Draqaz]]\n*[[Qezza]]\n*[[Hizdahr zo Loraq]]\n*[[Miklaz]]\n*[[Khrazz]]\n*[[Jezhene]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Groleo]]\n*[[Bloodbeard]]\n*[[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n*[[Yurkhaz zo Yunzak]]\n*[[Tywin Lannister]]\n*[[Aerys II Targaryen]]\n*[[Grey Worm]]\n*[[Symon Stripeback]]\n*[[Mollono Yos Dob]]\n*[[Marselen]]\n*[[Marghaz zo Loraq]]\n*[[Reznak mo Reznak]]\n*[[Hero]]\n*[[Jhogo]]\n*[[Daario Naharis]]\n*[[Denys Darklyn]]\n*[[Rhaegar Targaryen]]\n*[[Lyanna Stark]]\n*[[Daemon I Blackfyre]]\n*[[Daenerys Targaryen (daughter of Aegon IV)]]\n*[[Aegor Rivers]]\n*[[Brynden Rivers]]\n*[[Shiera Seastar]]\n*[[Prince of Dragonflies]]\n*[[Jenny of Oldstones]]\n*[[Duncan Targaryen]]\n*[[Jaehaerys II Targaryen]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Aegon V Targaryen]]\n*[[Grazhar zo Galare]]\n*[[Qezza Galare]]\n*[[Galazza Galare]]\n*[[Mezzara]]\n*[[Kezmya]]\n*[[Azzak]]\n*[[Bhakaz]]\n*[[Dhazzar]]\n*[[The Harpy]]\n*[[Rhaenys Targaryen (daughter of Rhaegar)]]\n*[[Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaegar)]]\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n*[[Jaime Lannister]]\n*[[Arthur Dayne]]\n*[[House Whent|Lord Whent]]\n*[[Oswell Whent]]\n*[[Varys]]/[[Varys|The Spider]]\n*[[Rhaella Targaryen]]\n*[[Elia Martell|Elia of Dorne]]\n*[[Ashara Dayne]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n*[[Lomas Longstrider]]\n*[[Quentyn Martell]]\n*[[Drogon]]\n*[[Barsena Blackhair]]\n|}\n\n==Places and Terms Mentioned==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[Great Pyramid|Great Pyramid of Meereen]]\n*[[Yunkai]]\n*[[Volantis]]\n*[[Duskendale]]\n*[[Ghis]]\n*[[Red Waste]]\n*[[Westeros]]\n*[[Seven Kingdoms]]\n*[[Oldstones]]\n*[[Summerhall]]\n*[[King\'s Landing]]\n*[[Trident]]\n*[[Meereen]]\n*[[Basilisk Isles]]\n*[[Lhazar]]\n*[[Ghis]]\n*[[Red Keep]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[Harrenhal]]\n*[[Dorne]]\n*[[Slaver\'s Bay]]\n*[[Great Pyramid of Ghis]]\n*[[Valyria]]\n*[[Qarth]]\n*[[Ghiscari Empire|Old Empire of Ghis]]\n*[[Arbor]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[House of Loraq]]\n*[[Dragon]]\n*[[Wise Masters]]\n*[[Stormcrows]]\n*[[Bloodrider]]\n*[[Unsullied]]\n*[[Free Brothers]]\n*[[Stalwart Shields]]\n*[[Mother\'s Men]]\n*[[Fighting pits]]\n*[[Kingsguard]]\n*[[Brazen Beasts]]\n*[[Sellsword]]\n*[[Summerhall#Tragedy at Summerhall|Tragedy at Summerhall]]\n*[[Poisoned locusts]]\n*[[Green Grace]]\n*[[House of Merreq]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[House of Pahl]]\n*[[House of Ghazeen]]\n*[[House of Zhak]]\n*[[House of Quazzar]]\n*[[House of Uhlez]]\n*[[House of Hazkar]]\n*[[House of Dhazak]]\n*[[House of Yherizan]]\n*[[Great Masters]]\n*[[Battle of the Trident]]\n*[[Sons of the Harpy]]\n*[[Tourney at Harrenhal]]\n*[[Queen of Love and Beauty]]\n*[[Faith of the Seven|The Seven]]\n*[[Dothraki]]\n*\'\'[[arakh]]\'\'\n|}\n\n==References==\n&lt;references/&gt;\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 67]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Barristan Selmy]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Meereen]]\n\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 67]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 68, Le briseur de roi]]</text>\n      <sha1>44ue8igj3zjaitgora90vq9hajr5j3m</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 66</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5672</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>184249</id>\n      <parentid>159639</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-05-22T21:21:30Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Mindset</username>\n        <id>4579</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4221">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]]\n| title\t\t= Tyrion IX\n| place         = [[King\'s Landing]]\n| page\t\t= 735\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 65|Arya XII]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 66|Tyrion IX]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 67|Jaime VIII]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 60|Tyrion VIII]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 70|Tyrion X]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis== \n[[Tyrion Lannister]] is imprisoned in a tower cell of the [[Red Keep]]. His uncle [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]] tells him that [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]], [[Mace Tyrell]], and [[Oberyn Martell]] will stand in judgment of him. When Tyrion claims he may demand [[trial by combat]], his uncle replies that [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] will name [[Gregor Clegane]] as her champion. Tyrion sends for [[Bronn]], but finds the former [[sellsword]] to be a changed man, soon to marry [[Lollys Stokeworth]], and now being paid well by the Queen. The mercenary leaves Tyrion to fend for himself, unwilling to stand for the dwarf against the Mountain. \n\nAt the trial, Tyrion declares his innocence, and claims that [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] was not responsible either. The witnesses that Cersei has brought forth are numerous, and since Tyrion has no witnesses of his own, their word is without refute. [[Pycelle]] notes that Tyrion stole poisons from his solar, and [[Taena of Myr|Taena Merryweather]] claims to have seen Tyrion drop something into the [[Joffrey Baratheon|King]]\xe2\x80\x99s wine. \n\nThat night, Kevan tells Tyrion that his only hope is to admit his guilt and he will be permitted to [[Night\'s Watch|take the black]], though Tyrion, remembering what happened to the [[Eddard Stark|last man]] to be made such an offer, is dismissive. They talk about Tyrion\'s father. Kevan is fiercely loyal to his brother, for it was Tywin who made the Lannisters\' enemies pay for their abuse of their father [[Tytos Lannister]], who was a peaceful but weak man. The next morning, [[Varys]] nearly seals Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s fate with damaging evidence against the dwarf.\n\nLater, Oberyn Martell visits Tyrion, and makes it clear that Cersei has tried to buy his vote in the judgment, mentioning marriage. But the Red Viper has other ideas, and even brings up the point that according to Dornish law, [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]] is the heir, and that [[Doran Martell|his brother]] may well crown his ward. Oberyn relates the story Tywin had told him that it was [[Amory Lorch]] who killed [[Elia Martell|Elia]] and her children, but Tyrion tells him the truth--that Lorch only killed [[Rhaenys Targaryen|Rhaenys]], and it was the Mountain who killed [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaegar)|Aegon]] and raped and murdered Elia. The Red Viper speaks of saving Tyrion, not as his judge, but as his champion.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Kevan Lannister]]\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Tywin Lannister]]\n*[[Mace Tyrell]]\n*[[Oberyn Martell]] The Red Viper\n*[[Cersei Lannister]]\n*[[Gregor Clegane]] The Mountain\n*[[Bronn]]\n*[[Lollys Stokeworth]]\n*[[Sansa Stark]]\n*[[Pycelle]]\n*[[Taena Merryweather]]\n*[[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n*[[Tytos Lannister]]\n*[[Varys]]\n*[[Myrcella Baratheon]]\n*[[Doran Martell]]\n*[[Amory Lorch]]\n*[[Elia Martell]]\n*[[Rhaenys Targaryen (daughter of Rhaegar)|Rhaenys Targaryen]]\n*[[Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaegar)|Aegon Targaryen]]\n}}\t\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Trial by combat]]\n*[[Sellsword]]\n*[[Night\'s Watch]]\n*[[Dornish]]\n}}\n\n\n==References and Notes== \n* The synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html] \n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/08/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-40 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Part 40].

[[Qhorin Halfhand]] has arrived, with 100 men from the [[Shadow Tower]]. Qhorin recognizes Jon, and tells him that he knew Lord [[Eddard Stark|Eddard]] and Jon\xe2\x80\x99s grandfather Lord [[Rickard Stark|Rickard]] as well. The men from the Shadow Tower were delayed because they met [[Alfyn Crowkiller]] and his men who had been scouting along [[the Wall]]. They killed the wildling leader and took some captives, but lost four men in the process. Later, Jon overhears dissent in the ranks as [[Chett]] and [[Lark]] the Sisterman speak of not going into the [[Frostfangs]], no matter what the [[Jeor Mormont|Old Bear]] orders. Jon has given the warhorn he found to [[Samwell Tarly|Sam]], because it is cracked and he could get no sound from it, but Sam likes ancient items. \n\nIn Mormont\'s tent, Jon overhears Qhorin telling Mormont about a captive claiming that [[Mance Rayder]] had [[warg]]s and [[mammoth]]s in his army. He also explains that the captive claims the wildlings plan to breach the Wall, not climb it or burrow beneath it. Qhorin tells them that Mance is seeking something in the high, cold places of the Frostfangs, some power or artifact. Qhorin advises the Old Bear to send scouts into the mountains, and Mormont agrees. [[Jarmen Buckwell]] will take four men to climb the [[Giant\'s Stair]], [[Thoren Smallwood]] will lead a party to probe the [[Milkwater]], while Qhorin himself will lead a third party into the [[Skirling Pass]]. Qhorin immediately chooses Jon Snow as one of his four men, stating, &quot;The [[old gods]] are still strong [[beyond the Wall]]. The gods of the [[First Men]]\xe2\x80\xa6and the [[House Stark|Starks]].&quot;\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n\n* The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n* [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2012/01/re-read-jon-v-half-legend.html Summary and analyses of the chapter] in the course of a 10th reread by Slynt.\n* [http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/05/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-20 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 43]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Jon Snow]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in the Fist of the First Men]]\n\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 43]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 44, Jon]]</text>\n      <sha1>8bim2102qpy3tc29rpxr02hskfrnqpt</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 46</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6883</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>168636</id>\n      <parentid>166588</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-07-14T16:20:55Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Gonzalo</username>\n        <id>4306</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <minor/>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7119">{{Infobox Chapter ADwD\n| pov\t\t= [[Theon Greyjoy]]\n| place         = [[Winterfell]]\n| title\t\t= A Ghost in Winterfell\n| page\t\t= 605\n| previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 45|The Blind Girl]]\n| current\t= A Ghost in Winterfell\n| next\t\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 47|Tyrion X]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 41|The Turncloak]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 51|Theon I]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\nOne of [[Roger Ryswell]]\'s men has been found dead at the inner wall of [[Winterfell]].  [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] hears Lord Roger Ryswell declare that he must\'ve fallen off the wall drunk, but he suspects it might have been murder, as do some others. \n\n[[Roose Bolton]] and his host are still stuck inside [[Winterfell]]\'s walls due to the relentless snow storms. They expect Stannis\' forces to attack them, but have no idea how close he may be due to the storms. Tensions rise among the people inside Winterfell, with no one quite certain whether it is a good idea to wait passively for Stannis or instead to pursue him outside. It doesn\'t help that food is somewhat scarce and distributed quite unevenly. \n\n[[Holly]], one of Abel the Bard\'s washer women, sits down next to Theon, who is upset that she has touched him. She asks him about the crypts, and a mistrusting Theon comes to the conclusion that she, Abel, and the other women want out of Winterfell. Theon sympathizes, but he fears the wrath of [[Ramsay Bolton]] and prefers not to get involved.\n\nThe next morning [[Aenys Frey]]\'s squire is found dead and naked outside in the snow. Later on that day another man, a crossbowman sworn to [[House Flint]], is found dead with a crushed skull, presumably from a horse kick.  \n\nNevertheless, the suspicions and tensions keep growing to the point that open quarreling happens among the host\'s Lords inside the Great Hall. Some are tired of waiting for Stannis and want to attack him. A fight nearly breaks out as [[Hosteen Frey|Ser Hosteen]] and [[Aenys Frey]] blame [[Wyman Manderly]] for the deaths of their three kin [[Rhaegar Frey|Rhaegar]], [[Jared Frey|Jared]], and [[Symond Frey|Symond]]. It almost comes to a duel before [[Roger Ryswell]] and [[Barbrey Dustin]] calm them down, though Roose does nothing throughout the near altercation and Theon sees something new in Roose\'s eyes for the first time: a hint of fear.\n\nSoon the newly rebuilt stable collapses, killing two men and twenty-six horses. Roose Bolton gives orders for the surviving horses to be brought inside the walls of Winterfell.\n\nA more suspicious death is discovered, that of [[Yellow Dick]]. His namesake is stuffed in his mouth so hard that three teeth have been broken. This death is taken more seriously as it cannot be confused with an accident and to boot he is one of Ramsay Bolton\'s [[Bastard Boys]]. Theon considers that a [[hooded man]] whom he meets may be responsible for the murder. Theon is later ushered to see Roose by [[Walton|Steelshanks Walton]]. Roose says that Theon has been seen where all the murders have occurred. Theon is freed from the suspicions due to his weakened physical and psychological state, as remarked by Lady Dustin and Roger Ryswell. It is now however undeniable that someone has been committing murders, possibly at Stannis\' behest. The resulting suspicion flames the tensions between the Freys and the Northmen, who are reminded of their role at the [[Red Wedding]] and the fact they are surrounded by northern Houses who all lost people at the Red Wedding and have more than good reason to despise and do harm to the Freys.\n\nSuddenly a war horn and drum is sounded, and the men inside the walls begin to believe that Stannis has arrived. Theon goes to pray in the [[godswood]], seeing hints of [[Bran Stark|Bran]]\'s very face in the [[weirwood]], hearing it whisper his name. \n\n[[Holly]], [[Rowan]] and a third washerwoman appear, claiming to have come for him. Theon believes that they are behind the murders and want to kill him now, but they deny his suspicions and insist that there will be no more hurt for him but instead a nice, quick death - but first he must see Abel.\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Theon Greyjoy]]/[[Theon Greyjoy|&quot;Reek&quot;]]/&lt;br&gt;[[Theon Greyjoy|Theon Turncloak]]\n*[[Ben Bones]]\n*[[Grey Jeyne]]\n*[[Roger Ryswell]]\n*[[Hosteen Frey]]\n*[[Ondrew Locke]]\n*[[Yellow Dick]]\n*[[Sour Alyn]]\n*[[Ramsay Bolton]]\n*[[Damon Dance-for-Me]]\n*[[Skinner]]\n*[[Hother Umber|Whoresbane Umber]]\n*[[Rickard Ryswell]]\n*[[Barbrey Dustin]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Holly]]\n*[[Aenys Frey]]\n*[[Harwood Stout]]\n*[[Roose Ryswell]]\n*[[Wyman Manderly]]\n*[[Sara]]\n*[[Willow (Hound)|Willow]]\n*[[Mance Rayder|Abel]]\n*[[Luton]]\n*[[Grunt]]\n*[[Hooded man]]\n*[[Walton|Steelshanks Walton]]\n*[[Roose Bolton]]\n*[[Rowan]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Stannis Baratheon]]\n*[[Roose Ryswell]]\n*[[Melisandre]]\n*[[Walder Frey (son of Merrett)|Little Walder Frey]]\n*[[Red Jeyne]]\n*[[Jez]]\n*[[Helicent]]\n*[[Aggar]]\n*[[Gynir|Gynir Rednose]]\n*[[Gelmarr|Gelmarr the Grim]]\n*[[Ramsay Bolton|&quot;Reek&quot;]]\n*[[Rhaegar Frey]]\n*[[Jared Frey]]\n*[[Symond Frey]]\n*[[Wendel Manderly]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Tywin Lannister]]\n*[[Wylis Manderly]]\n*[[Jeyne Poole|&quot;Arya Stark&quot;]]\n*[[Mikken]]\n*[[Farlen]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n*[[Catelyn Tully|Catelyn Stark]]\n*[[Jon Umber (Greatjon)|Greatjon Umber]]\n*[[Donella Hornwood]]\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Jon Snow]]\n*[[Robert I Baratheon]]\n*[[Bran Stark]]\n*[[Rickon Stark]]\n|}\n\n==Places and Terms Mentioned==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[Winterfell]]\n*[[Wall]]\n*[[Winterfell#Inner Castle|Great Hall]] (Winterfell)\n*[[Dreadfort]]\n*[[Winterfell|Battlements Gate]] (Winterfell)\n*[[Winterfell#External Walls|Hunter\'s Gate]] (Winterfell)\n*[[Winterfell|Kingsroad Gate]] (Winterfell)\n*[[White Harbor]]\n*[[King\'s Landing]]\n*[[Riverrun]]\n*[[Pyke]]\n*[[Iron Islands]]\n*[[Seven Kingdoms]]\n*[[Acorn Water]]\n*[[Winterfell#Inner Castle|Great Keep]] (Winterfell)\n*[[Barrowton]]\n*[[Wolfswood]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[House Tallhart]]\n*[[House Cerwyn]]\n*[[R\'hllor|Red God]]\n*[[Bastard\'s Boys]]\n*[[old gods]]\n*[[House Flint]]\n*[[Faith of the Seven|The Seven]]\n*&quot;[[Iron Lances]]&quot;\n*&quot;[[The Winter Maid]]&quot;\n*&quot;[[The Queen Took Off Her Sandal, the King Took Off His Crown]]&quot;\n*&quot;[[The Bear and the Maiden Fair]]&quot;\n*[[House Frey]]\n*&quot;[[The Maids That Bloom in Spring]]&quot;\n*[[Kinslayer]]\n*[[Ironborn]]\n*[[Godswood]]\n*[[Red Wedding]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[House Slate]]\n*[[House Ryswell]]\n*[[House Dustin]]\n*[[Northmen]]\n*[[House Baratheon]]\n*[[House Bolton]]\n*[[Horn of Joramun]]\n*[[House Hornwood]]\n*[[House Locke]]\n*[[House Stark]]\n*[[Direwolf]]\n*[[Weirwood]]/[[Weirwood|Heart Tree]]\n*[[House Greyjoy]]\n|}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 46]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Theon Greyjoy]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Winterfell]]\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 46]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 47, Un fant\xc3\xb4me \xc3\xa0 Winterfell]]</text>\n      <sha1>nzgt1lko5ef6rkcg4yviq9c9nkkz3p4</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 52</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6896</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166597</id>\n      <parentid>130572</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-26T10:39:56Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4630">{{Infobox Chapter ADwD\n| pov\t\t= [[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n| place         = [[Meereen]]\n| title\t\t= Daenerys IX\n| page\t\t= 687\n| previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 51|Theon I]]\n| current\t= Daenerys IX\n| next\t\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 53|Jon XI]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 50|Daenerys VIII]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 71|Daenerys X]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:Dp_bw.jpeg|[[Daznak\'s Pit]] - by [http://ashleyhunterrice.tumblr.com/ Ashley Hunter Rice]|thumb|left|255px]]\n[[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] bathes in preparation for her visit with [[Hizdahr zo Loraq|her husband]] to [[Meereen]]\'s fighting pits. Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] tells her that the girl [[Meris]], whom they set free, said that the [[Windblown]] were willing to join her cause, if Dany gave the [[Tattered Prince]] [[Pentos]]. Dany cannot agree to pay this as [[Illyrio Mopatis|Illyrio]] is from that city and has helped her more than anyone. Her obligations are to him first.\n\nShe then departs with her husband and they arrive at the pits, where [[Strong Belwas]] eats a bowl of fried locusts. Hizdahr tells his wife that they are tasty as well, but she declines as Dany is not interested in the spicy food. There are twenty thousand spectators in the pit. As Hizdahr announces the fights, they chant her name, though they use the [[Ghiscari]] word for \'\'Mother\'\' because they cannot pronounce her [[Westeros]]i name. Dany thinks to herself that it is not her they love, but the fighting.\n[[File:Dany drogon Daznak\'s PitMarc Simonetti4.png|Daenerys and Drogon in [[Daznak\'s Pit]] - by Marc Simonetti \xc2\xa9|thumb|left|350px]]\nThe first fight begins with a victory for the [[Spotted Cat]], and there are many more after that. Following them, the first folly of the day begins with two dwarfs jousting, [[Tyrion Lannister|one on a pig]], [[Penny|the other on a dog]]. One dwarf has a shield painted in the colours of [[House Lannister]], which amuses Daenerys. That one falls off the pig and is chased by the other on the dog when Hizdahr tells Dany that they are about to loose the lions. She tells him this was not in their agreement, that the dwarfs did not consent to this like the other fighters who died did, so she forbids that the lions slaughter the dwarfs.\n\nUp next is a bout between [[Barsena Blackhair]] and a boar. The fight goes well until the boar\'s tusk rips her open from the knee to the crotch. The boar then jumps on her, pulling out her entrails, all to the displeasure of the crowd. Daenerys insists on leaving as she is disgusted and no longer wants any part in this. Strong Belwas becomes sick from his locusts, asking for a drink of milk.\n\nIt is then that [[Drogon]] appears, his attention drawn by the blood and screams. His fires sear the boar, before he eats it and then Barsena. A man runs to try to kill the dragon, jabbing a spear into Drogon\'s neck before the dragon kills him. Hizdahr commands the rest of his spearmen to kill the dragon. Drogon roasts two spearmen, breaks the pitmaster in two with a swipe of his tail and tears out the innards of another spearman. As Strong Belwas is puking, Dany runs into the fighting pit in a mad state, hearing footsteps behind her. When she gets close, she fears the dragon does not recognize her and will kill her. As he blows fire at her she rolls under the flames, and she whips him until finally he allows her to mount him. She leaps onto his back, pulling out the spear. As she whips him again, he takes flight, and she tells him to go higher, watching as Meereen grows smaller below.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n*[[Jhiqui]]\n*[[Irri]]\n*[[Missandei]]\n*[[Hizdahr zo Loraq]]\n*[[Quentyn Martell]]\n*[[Barristan Selmy]]\n*[[Belwas|Strong Belwas]]\n*[[Meris|Pretty Meris]]\n*[[Tattered Prince]]\n*[[Illyrio Mopatis]]\n*[[Drogo|Khal Drogo]]\n*[[Groleo]]\n*[[Aggo]]\n*[[Rakharo]]\n*[[Reznak mo Reznak]]\n*[[Gerris Drinkwater]]\n*[[Archibald Yronwood]]\n*[[Goghor the Giant]]\n*[[Belaquo Bonebreaker]]\n*[[Galazza Galare]]\n*[[Ben Plumm|Brown Ben Plumm]]\n*[[Bloodbeard]]\n*[[Khrazz]]\n*[[Rhaego]]\n*[[Mirri Maz Duur]]\n*[[Jorah Mormont]]\n*[[Spotted Cat]]\n*[[Barsena Blackhair]]\n*[[Penny]]\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Yezzan zo Qaggaz]]\n*[[Crunch]]\n*[[Pretty Pig]]\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n*[[Daario Naharis]]\n*[[Drogon]]\n*[[Harghaz]]\n*[[Hazzea]]\n}}\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 52]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Daenerys Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Meereen]]\n\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 52]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 53, Daenerys]]</text>\n      <sha1>awttzs3rei4an9r5imppwccdtsuxp8a</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Clash of Kings-Chapter 5</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5649</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>177772</id>\n      <parentid>166409</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-12-23T15:06:50Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Nittanian</username>\n        <id>3504</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11369">{{Infobox Chapter ACfK\n| pov\t\t= [[Arya Stark]]\n| place         = An inn on the [[kingsroad]].\n| title\t\t= Arya II\n| page\t\t= 60\n| previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 4|Bran I]]\n| current\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 5|Arya II]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 6|Jon I]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 1|Arya I]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 9|Arya III]]\n}}\n\n[[Arya Stark|Arya]] and the others encounter more refugees every day as they journey north. One evening they halt at an inn, where they hear news of the war in the [[riverlands]]. Outside the inn, Arya talks with the prisoner [[Jaqen H\'ghar]]. Soon after, six [[gold cloaks]] arrive with an arrest warrant for the [[Gendry|Bull]], but [[Yoren]] refuses and after a tense standoff the gold cloaks retreat. \n\n==Synopsis==   \nEach day, [[Arya Stark|Arya]] and the others travel from dawn to dusk, and at night they eat by the light of the [[Red Comet|Red Sword]]. The men take turns standing watch, since they can see the firelight of other travellers. Every night there are more camps and every day there is more traffic on the [[kingsroad]]. They meet every kind of person and every mode of transportation, but most come by foot, with their goods on their shoulders and wary looks on their faces. They are all headed south toward [[King\'s Landing]], and Arya wonders why no one else is going north like them.\n\nOne morning, a passing merchant offers to buy [[Yoren]]\xe2\x80\x99s wagons for a quarter of their worth. He explains there is war to the north and claims Yoren will do better selling to him than being robbed by soldiers, but Yoren refuses. That same day, Arya notices the first grave (dug for a child) and a few leagues on [[Praed]] points out a whole row of them. After that hardly a day passes without seeing one. \n\nOne night, Arya wakes to find the night oddly quiet. When Praed does not wake the next morning, Arya realizes it was his coughing that was missing. They bury the sellsword where he slept and split his valuables amongst them. Yoren gives the longsword to the Bull, claiming he has the arm to learn to wield it.\n\nThat evening they stop in a village at an ivy-covered inn. They cannot afford rooms, but Yoren arranges a hot meal and use of the bathhouse if anyone feels the need. Arya knows she must smell as bad as Yoren, but cannot risk revealing her gender by bathing. She rationalizes that it would be a shame to drown the creatures living in her clothes that have come all the way from [[Flea Bottom]]. The [[Gendry|Bull]], [[Tarber]], and [[Hot Pie]] line up for the bathhouse with some of the other men while the rest crowd into the common room. Yoren even sends [[Lommy]] out with tankards for the three men who remain fettered in the wagon.\n\nThe innkeeper gives them all a round of beer on the house and tells them his brother [[Lync]] was sent to the [[Wall]] for filching pepper from his [[Malcolm|lord]]\xe2\x80\x99s table. Arya sips her beer cautiously, remembering how she enjoyed beer when her father permitted it and how [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] would make a sour face and insist wine was ever so much finer. The memories make her sad.\n\nThe inn is full of refugees who scorn Yoren\xe2\x80\x99s plan to continue north. The innkeeper explains that half the fields are burnt, and the remaining people are walled up in holdfasts. Yoren insists that the [[Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch]] takes not part, but the innkeeper points out that [[Vale mountain clans|wild men]] have come down from the [[Mountains of the Moon]] and the [[Robb Stark|young Lord Stark]] has come south to war. Mention of her brother grabs Arya\xe2\x80\x99s attention. A man named [[Hod]] claims that Robb rides into battle on a wolf as big as a horse, which no one seems to believe.\n\nThen talk turns to the great pack of wolves near the [[Gods Eye]] who have even attacked men, led by a she-wolf from the seventh hell. Talk of a she-wolf makes Arya wonder if the Gods Eye is near the [[Trident]], where she was forced to leave her [[direwolf]] [[Nymeria (direwolf)|Nymeria]]. One of the travellers claims that this she-wolf once snatched a baby from its mother\xe2\x80\x99s arms in the midst of a village, and that the men who pursued lost all of their dogs and nearly their lives. Arya blurts out that this is just a story because wolves do not eat babies. The man asks what Arya would know about wolves, but Yoren gives her a shove and orders her outside before she can answer.\n\n[[File:Jaqen H\'ghar.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Jaqen H\xe2\x80\x99ghar \xe2\x80\x93 by Amok\xc2\xa9]]\n\nOutside, the youngest and handsomest of the three men in the wagon calls to her with a friendly voice. Arya approaches warily with one hand on [[Needle]]. The man is slender and fine-featured with red hair on one side and white on the other. He speaks in a strange syntax, referring to himself as \xe2\x80\x9ca man\xe2\x80\x9d and to Arya as \xe2\x80\x9ca boy,\xe2\x80\x9d and his accent reminds her of [[Syrio Forel]]. He asks for another beer and suggests he could use a bath, claiming Arya could make a friend. Arya insist that she has friends, but the noseless prisoner remarks that he cannot see any. The third prisoner only hisses and sticks out the stump of his tongue. \n\nThe friendly prisoner begs forgiveness for his present company, and introduces himself as [[Jaqen H\'ghar]] from [[Lorath]]. He introduces the noseless man as [[Rorge]] and the other as [[Biter]] (a name Jaqen gave the mute because of his filed teeth). Rorge curses and throws his tankard at Arya, demanding more beer, but she manages to dodge. Asking herself what Syrio would do, Arya draws her practice sword. Rorge threatens her, but Arya recalls her mantra, \xe2\x80\x9cFear cuts deeper than swords,\xe2\x80\x9d and approaches the wagon. When Biter lurches at her, Arya hits him hard right between the eyes. Biter reels back but then throws all his weight against his chains and attempts to grab her again. When the bonds hold and Biter collapses, Jaqen H\xe2\x80\x99ghar observes that Arya has more courage than sense.\n\nArya backs away from the wagon again. When she feels a hand on her shoulder she whirls around, but it is only the Bull, who reminds her that Yoren warned them not to go near the three in the wagon. Arya insists they do not scare her, but the Bull replies, \xe2\x80\x9cThen you\xe2\x80\x99re stupid. They scare me.\xe2\x80\x9d As the Bull leads her away, Arya hears Rorge laughing and Biter hissing behind them. \n\nWanting to hit something, Arya asks if the Bull wants to fight. Startled, he warns her how strong he is, but Arya argues that she is quick. The Bull draws Praed\xe2\x80\x99s longsword and declares it cheap steal, but still a real sword. Arya draws Needle and declares that it is good steel, which makes it even realer. They each ask the other to promise not to cry if they get cut. Arya assumes her [[water dancer]]\'s stance, but the Bull is distracted by six [[gold cloaks]] riding up the kingsroad on lathered horses.\n\nAs the gold cloaks draw up in front of the inn, Arya pulls the Bull behind a tall hedge and tells him to be quiet as a shadow. The gold cloak officer asks some of the recruits outside the bathhouse if they are the ones who left King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing to take the black. The men say they might be, so the officer dismounts and declares he has a warrant for a certain boy.\n\nYoren steps out of the inn to ask who wants the boy. The officer presents his warrant and declares that Queen [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] sent them. Behind the hedge, the Bull asks why he and Arya are hiding. Arya explains that it her they are after. The Bull asks why the queen would want her, but Arya tells him to be quiet. Yoren declares the warrant pretty, but insists that the boy is in the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch so what he did back in the city does not matter. The officer declares that neither he nor the queen cares. Arya considers running, but knows she cannot escape. She decides she is tired of running; a real water dancer would never run.\n\n[[File:Gendry Amoka.png|thumb|240px|right|Gendry, a.k.a. the Bull \xe2\x80\x93 by Amok\xc2\xa9]]\n\nYoren insists that the gold cloaks will have no one, since there are laws on such things. The officer draws his shortsword and declares it his law. Yoren only looks at the blade and declares, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s no law, just a sword. Happens I got one too.\xe2\x80\x9d The officer threatens that he has five men with him, but Yoren spits and declares that he has thirty. A gold cloak with a broken nose laughs and asks who is first. In a gesture of solidarity, Tarber takes up a pitchfork, [[Cutjack]] pulls out his hammer, [[Kurz]] draws his skinning knife, [[Koss]] strings his longbow, [[Reysen]] snatches up his staff, [[Dobber]] (fresh from the bath) drops everything but his dagger, and [[Hot Pie]] scrambles to find a big rock. Arya is amazed; she hates Hot Pie, so why would he risk his life for her?\n\nRefusing to let the others die for her, Arya shoves through the hedge with Needle and joins the others. The gold cloak with the broken nose laughs and tells her to put away the blade, calling her a girl. Arya insist she is not a girl, furious that they do not understand she is the one they want. Yet when the Bull comes up behind her the officer declares him the one they want. It is a mistake to take his eyes off Yoren, however, and quick as a snake Yoren places his sword at the officer\xe2\x80\x99s throat.\n\nYoren declares that the gold cloaks will have neither of them, and reminds the officer that he has even more brothers in the inn. The officer drops his sword and Yoren declares that good steel is always needed on the Wall. The officer declares that Yoren had best hurry back to the Wall, and promises that if he catches Yoren again he will take his head as well the boy\'s. Yoren declares that better men have tried and slaps the officer\xe2\x80\x99s horse with his sword. The other gold cloaks follow.\n\nOnce the gold cloaks are out of sight, Hot Pie whoops in triumph, but Yoren remains angry and orders everyone up and moving; if they ride all night they may be able to stay ahead for awhile. After giving the officer\xe2\x80\x99s sword to Hot Pie, Yoren walks over to the Bull and declares that the queen wants him bad. Arya asks why the queen would want a bastard boy like the Bull, but the Bull asks why she would want a gutter rat like Arya. Suspicious that the Bull is more than he appears, Arya asks his true name. He replies that it is Gendry. Yoren claims not to know why anyone would want either of them, but declares they cannot have them regardless. He orders Gendry and Arya to take the two coursers and orders them to ride hard for the Wall at the first sight of a gold cloak, since the rest of them mean nothing to the gold cloaks. Arya points out that the officer promised to take Yoren\xe2\x80\x99s head, but Yoren replies that if the man can take it he is welcome to it.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n*[http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2010/02/bran-arya.html Humorous review of the chapter] by Jason.\n*[http://slynt.blogspot.com/2011/04/re-read-arya-ii.html Review of the chapter in the course of the 10th reread] by Slynt.\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/01/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-3 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 05]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Arya Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place along the Kingsroad]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in the Crownlands]]\n\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 06, Arya]]</text>\n      <sha1>gapnjxuiav8am09b8sil49h9bgxllih</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Feast for Crows-Chapter 6</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5742</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>185959</id>\n      <parentid>166938</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-06-21T02:25:54Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Gonzalo</username>\n        <id>4306</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <comment>/* Synopsis */</comment>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3124">{{Infobox Chapter AFfC\n| pov\t\t= [[Arya Stark]]\n| title\t\t= Arya I\n| place         = [[Braavos]]\n| page\t\t= 87\n| previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 5|Samwell I]]\n| current\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 6|Arya I]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 7|Cersei II]]\n| arc previous\t= \n| arc next\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 22|Arya II]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\nNearing [[Braavos]], [[Arya Stark|Arya]] recalls how she originally wanted Captain [[Ternesio Terys]] to  sail for [[the Wall]]. She had no such luck, but concluded that the [[Free Cities]] would be a good place to land, considering that [[Syrio Forel]] came from Braavos and possibly [[Jaqen H\'ghar]] as well. \n\nDuring the voyage, many of the sailors and even the captain have tried to get her to learn and remember their names, and many seem afraid of her. The captain\'s younger son [[Denyo Terys|Denyo]] is telling Arya some of the history of Braavos and the Titan that guards its port. The free city honors all gods and even has temples devoted to them, and was founded by the [[Moonsingers]] when they brought the people to Braavos to escape the dragons of [[Valyria]]. The [[Titan of Braavos]] is a massive statue, and has arrow slits and murder holes strategically placed to attack any boat that tries to pass beneath without leave. Furthermore, the Free City of Braavos is protected by the [[Arsenal]], a massive fleet of ships and their fortified port.\n\nThe captain has his older son [[Yorko Terys|Yorko]] row Arya to shore, so as to get her off prior to customs coming aboard. As Yorko navigates the hundred isles of Braavos, he points out many of the sites, before dropping her off at the quay in front of the [[House of Black and White]]. Arya disembarks, assuring Yorko that she will remember his name, and enters the temple of the [[Many-Faced God]]. Within, the temple is quite dark with dozens of odd statues, and Arya notices several people in alcoves who are either dead or dying. Soon, a robed man with a  kind voice tells her that the House of Black and White is a place of peace. He asks her name, but despite Arya\'s use of nicknames, the man keeps asking until she admits that she is Arya Stark. When the man asks if she fears death, Arya answers no.

She wonders when [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] will be coming for her, in addition to wondering what has happened to [[Loras Tyrell]] as last she heard, he lay dying from his wounds on [[Dragonstone]]. She only ever sees three people which are her gaolers [[Unella|Septa Unella]], [[Moelle|Septa Moelle]], and [[Scolera|Septa Scolera]]. Her last visitor was [[Qyburn]]. She hates all three of them as much as those she assumes have betrayed her, blaming [[Osney Kettleblack]], [[Orton Merryweather]], [[Harys Swyft]], [[Aurane Waters]] and [[Grand Maester Pycelle]]. She questions whether she should include Jaime in that group but will not believe it. He would not abandon her, she assumes. \n\nShe feels helpless and hates that emotion, and she prays endlessly to the [[Faith of the Seven|Seven Gods]], since that is what they want, but it helps not. At first she fights with her guards but they are much stronger than she thought, they keep her up endlessly, never letting her sleep. Exhausted, she comes to know that she must confess. She asks to be taken to the [[High Septon]] to confess, where she admits to extra-marital affairs. She says she has slept with [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]] and the [[House Kettleblack|Kettleblack brothers]]. She insists she did these things because she was afraid for her children and these were her only means to secure the trust of these men.\n\nThe [[High Sparrow]] still means to accuse her of high treason, incest, regicide, and deicide, all crimes that Osney Kettleblack admitted Cersei had a part in under torture. She manages to talk her way out of the charges of murdering the previous High Septon and [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] and bearing false witness against the Tyrell girls, and avoids the charges of incest by saying that these are lies that Stannis has made up in order to gain the [[Iron Throne]], which satisfies the High Septon, since the Faith is eager to condemn Stannis\' \'worship of a [[R\'hllor|red demon]]\'. To get the real truth, though, the High Septon means to have her tried by the Faith or [[trial by combat]], where Cersei would be represented by a knight of the [[Kingsguard]]. He is unsure of all the crimes she has committed so the only way to pick the truth from the false is to let the gods decide.\n\nShe is allowed a visit by her uncle [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]] who, though angry with her for corrupting Lancel, answers her questions. He tells her that Jaime is missing after his return from [[Raventree Hall]], having disappeared with an unknown woman, though they assume it is [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]]. There is word of sellswords appearing all over the south. They do not have the strength to deal with them, though [[Mace Tyrell]] does. However, he is unwilling to do so until the matter with his daughter [[Margaery Tyrell]] is settled. Mace Tyrell is now the [[Hand of the King|Hand]], [[Paxter Redwyne]] is the king\'s admiral, and [[Randyll Tarly]] is the justiciar. The Tyrells brought up an army when their daughters were seized, although the High Septon has admitted the case against them is weak.\n\nKevan brings worse news for Cersei. He relays [[Balon Swann]]\'s news of [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]]\'s loss of an ear, and [[Arys Oakheart]]\'s death. Though Cersei is insistent that Myrcella\'s mutilation is [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion\'s]] doing, she sees a chance in the open position in the Kingsguard, and asks Kevan to approach Qyburn for a replacement.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Cersei Lannister]]\n*[[Jaime Lannister]]\n*[[Loras Tyrell]]\n*[[Qyburn]]\n*[[Unella]]\n*[[Moelle]]\n*[[Scolera]]\n*[[Osney Kettleblack]]\n*[[High Sparrow]]\n*[[Osmund Kettleblack]]\n*[[Osfryd Kettleblack]]\n*[[Aurane Waters]]\n*[[Orton Merryweather]]\n*[[Taena of Myr]]\n*[[Harys Swyft]]\n*[[Pycelle]]\n*[[Meryn Trant]]\n*[[Boros Blount]]\n*[[Lancel Lannister]]\n*[[Kevan Lannister]]\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n*[[High Septon (Tyrion\'s)|Tyrion\'s High Septon]]\n*[[Tommen Baratheon]]\n*[[Tywin Lannister]]\n*[[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n*[[Margaery Tyrell]]\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Stannis Baratheon]]\n*[[Tytos Blackwood]]\n*[[Brienne of Tarth]]\n*[[Selwyn Tarth]]\n*[[Mace Tyrell]]\n*[[Paxter Redwyne]]\n*[[Randyll Tarly]]\n*[[Blue Bard]]\n*[[Hobber Redwyne]]\n*[[Horas Redwyne]]\n*[[Hamish|Hamish the Harper]]\n*[[Myrcella Baratheon]]\n*[[Balon Swann]]\n*[[Oberyn Martell]]\n*[[Gerold Dayne]]\n*[[Doran Martell]]\n*[[Arys Oakheart]]\n*[[Arthur Dayne]]\n*[[Trystane Martell]]\n}}\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 54]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 55, Cersei]]\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 54]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Cersei Lannister]]</text>\n      <sha1>510ebnbtfp3nch3vflny52ra6bg8dou</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 1</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6805</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>184396</id>\n      <parentid>184395</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-05-25T18:43:00Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Dancing Maester</username>\n        <id>6281</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <comment>/* Synopsis */</comment>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2794">{{Infobox Chapter ADwD\n| pov\t\t= [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n| place         = the [[Narrow Sea]] - [[Pentos]]\n| title\t\t= Tyrion I\n| page\t\t= 16\n| previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Prologue|Prologue]]\n| current\t= Tyrion I\n| next\t\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 2|Daenerys I]]\n| arc previous\t= \n| arc next\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 5|Tyrion II]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] is in the cabin of a ship fleeing across the [[narrow sea]], perpetually drunk and wracked with guilt over his betrayal of the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] and murder of [[Tywin Lannister|his father]], as well as his anxiety over the fate of [[Tysha]], whom he now knows to be the only woman ever to have truly loved him. \n\nHaving escaped and found passage across the sea thanks to [[Varys]], he ponders where he might be going. He decides he would prefer to go to [[Dorne]] so he can raise his niece [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]] to the [[Iron Throne]]. Once the ship reaches port he is bundled into a barrel and smuggled off the ship, finding himself in [[Pentos]], in the home of [[Magister]] [[Illyrio Mopatis]].\n\nTyrion spends a day wandering around Illyrio\'s home talking to his servants and plotting escape. He discovers [[Tyrion\'s mushrooms|a patch of poisonous mushrooms]] and picks them before passing out. He meets a courtesan of Illyrio\'s who has been assigned to him, threatening her before heading off to dinner with the Magister. \n\nHe is eventually served a dish of mushrooms and contemplates whether Illyrio is trying to poison him, and whether it would not be best just to eat some and be done with it. Illyrio goads him before eating some of the mushrooms himself and asking Tyrion of his intentions. He informs Tyrion that [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] is at the [[Wall]], and says that neither Stannis at the Wall nor Myrcella in Dorne is a viable candidate for support in the game of thrones. Mopatis claims that Westeros is in need of a savior from across the sea. When Tyrion asks who that would be, he replies &quot;[[House Targaryen|A dragon with three heads]]&quot;.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Tywin Lannister]]\n*[[Tysha]]\n*[[Varys]]\n*[[Myrcella Baratheon]]\n*[[Illyrio Mopatis]]\n*[[Stannis Baratheon]]\n}}\t\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Narrow Sea]]\n*[[House Lannister]]\n*[[Dorne]]\n*[[Iron Throne]]\n*[[Pentos]]\n*[[Magister]]\n*[[Tyrion\'s mushrooms]]\n*[[Wall]]\n*[[House Targaryen]]\n}}\n\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 01]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Tyrion Lannister]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place on the Narrow Sea]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Pentos]]\n\n\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 1]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 02, Tyrion]]</text>\n      <sha1>fv05wlyt9pukf51daw3cjoys50wic0w</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 47</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5807</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166488</id>\n      <parentid>118623</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-24T13:45:25Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Frernok</username>\n        <id>5007</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <comment>/*References and Notes*/</comment>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2837">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Arya Stark|Arya]]\n| title\t\t= Arya IX\n| place         = [[Lord Harroway\'s Town]]\n| page\t\t= 537\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 46|Samwell III]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 47|Arya IX]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 48|Jon VI]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 43|Arya VIII]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 50|Arya X]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Arya Stark|Arya]] attempts to kill [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]] at night while the man is asleep, but he awakens and takes the rock from her hands.

Arya tells Sandor that she had once been captured by [[Gregor Clegane|his brother]], and the Hound finds it amusing that Gregor never knew who he had caught. Clegane says, &quot;I\xe2\x80\x99ll be sure and tell him that, before I cut his heart out.&quot;  She asks why he would kill his brother and the Hound asks didn\'t she ever want to kill a brother or sister? He realizes from Arya\xe2\x80\x99s expression that the &quot;wolf bitch&quot; hates the &quot;pretty bird&quot;--Arya and her sister don\'t get along. Sandor admits that maybe he is a monster for killing so many but also tells her that he saved [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]]\xe2\x80\x99s life when the mob tried to kill her.  The Hound informs her that he is taking her to [[the Twins]], and will ransom her to [[Robb Stark|Robb]] and perhaps join the Young Wolf\xe2\x80\x99s service, because &quot;even a dog gets tired of being kicked.&quot;\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Arya Stark]]\n*[[Sandor Clegane]] The Hound\n*[[Beric Dondarrion]]\n*[[Gregor Clegane]]\n*[[Sansa Stark]]\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n}}\t\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n*[[Lord Harroway\'s Town]]\n*[[Trident]]\n*[[The Twins]]\n}}\n\n\n==References and Notes==\n*The synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/05/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-27 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Part 27].

While they thought they would be only three days from [[Winterfell]], the snows have kept them stranded for nineteen days. Food has become a major concern. The supply of fish from the lake has been diminishing, they have already been relying on their dying horses as a source of food for a while now, and foraging has brought little result. Some men have even begun to resort to cannibalism: four men from [[House Peasebury]] were caught eating parts of a dead man from [[House Fell]].\n\nThere are growing tensions between the [[queen\'s men]] that Stannis brought with him from Dragonstone and the other people present, both local northerners and the [[king\'s men]] that Stannis brought from [[Dragonstone]] and the [[Stormlands]] with him.  \n\nFueling those tensions, Ser [[Godry Farring]] the Giantslayer, Ser [[Corliss Penny]] and Ser [[Clayton Suggs]] are about to burn the four cannibals in sacrifice for [[R\'hllor]], hoping to stope the snowfall. Northerners [[Artos Flint]] and [[Hugo Wull|Big Bucket Wull]] express dislike of the sacrifice. Asha has noticed that Clayton Suggs is a cruel man and fears that he may eventually turn against her.\n\nStannis himself has been retreating to a tower roof with a perennial flame for four days, since his squire [[Bryen Farring]] was given a funeral burning after dying from the cold. He returns now, along with Queen\'s Man Ser [[Richard Horpe]] and [[Karhold]]\'s castellan [[Arnolf Karstark]], whose men joined theirs eight days past. There are rumors that Arnolf may hold Winterfell in Stannis\' behest if they are successful at retaking the castle. Stannis authorizes the sacrifice and watches it until its end.&lt;ref&gt;Pages 814-819&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nSer [[Justin Massey]] remains close to Asha and protects her from the worst of Clayton Suggs\' threats.  He also reveals that he is no longer a true believer in R\'hllor and hints that he knows more than he is telling.\n\nJustin offers to guard Asha for a while, relieving Aly Mormont from that duty.  The two of them eat some roasted horse in the hall.  Stannis\' knights are however lost by a lack of options, knowing that they are likely to die soon no matter what they do, since they have no food nor are they in any condition to fight [[Roose Bolton]]\'s forces at Winterfell. Talk is tense and frustrated, and eventually Justin leaves the Hall. Attempting to follow him, Asha finds Clayton Suggs instead. He threatens her, but the two of them are surprised to find that riders are coming to Stannis\' encampment.  \n\nAssuming that this is an attack from the Boltons and [[House Frey|Freys]], Clayton commands Asha to warn the others while he alone attempts to delay the riders. But there is no immediate danger, for the riders are not hostile. It is instead the group of [[Tycho Nestoris]], representative of the [[Iron Bank of Braavos]], with two men of the [[Night\'s Watch]] and the seven [[ironmen]] that he ransomed from [[Sybelle Locke]]. Asha recognizes [[Tristifer Botley]] among them. \n\nThe group has come by way of Winterfell, where they found [[Crowfood Umber]] beating drums and blowing horns, and have brought [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] and [[Jeyne Poole|Jeyne]] from Winterfell.  \n\nJeyne\'s nose is black from frostbite, and no one has referred to her by name yet, so it is not clear whether Tycho\'s group knows that she is not [[Arya Stark]]. Asha fails to recognize Theon, who looks decades older than she knows him to be. Theon, however, reveals his identity to Asha, much to her shock.\n\n==Character List appearing/mentioned==\n{{Columns|3|\n* [[Asha Greyjoy]]\n* [[Alysane Mormont]]\n* [[Godry Farring]]\n* [[Artos Flint]]\n* [[Hugo Wull|Big Bucket Wull]]\n* [[Corliss Penny]]\n* [[Clayton Suggs]]\n* [[Justin Massey]]\n* [[Bryen Farring]]\n* [[Stannis]]\n* [[Melisandre]]\n* [[Richard Horpe]]\n* [[Arnolf Karstark]]\n* [[Eddard Stark]]\n* [[Theon Greyjoy]]\n* [[William Foxglove]]\n* [[Humfrey Clifton]]\n* [[Ormund Wylde]]\n* [[Ned Woods]]\n* [[Roose Bolton]]\n* [[Arthor Karstark]]\n* [[Arya Stark]]\n* [[Robb Stark]]\n* [[Middle Liddle]]\n* [[Crowfood Umber]]\n* [[Tristifer Botley]]\n* [[Roggon Rustbeard]]\n* [[Grimtongue]]\n* [[Fingers]]\n* [[Rook]]\n* [[Cromm]]\n* [[Sybelle Locke|Sybelle Glover]]\n* [[Tycho Nestoris]]\n* [[Mors Umber]]\n}}\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 62]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Asha Greyjoy]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in the Wolfswood]]\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 62]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 63, Le sacrifice]]</text>\n      <sha1>6ssgb8tws3r9w1wtfsg6104db8886hw</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Storm of Swords-Chapter 35</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5774</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>194335</id>\n      <parentid>170499</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-10-08T10:10:45Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Ran</username>\n        <id>2</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <minor/>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4556">{{Infobox Chapter ASoS\n| pov\t\t= [[Catelyn Tully|Catelyn]]\n| title\t\t= Catelyn IV\n| place         = [[Riverrun]]\n| page\t\t= 392\n| previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 34|Arya VI]]\n| current\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 35|Catelyn IV]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 36|Davos IV]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 20|Catelyn III]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 45|Catelyn V]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Hoster Tully]] has finally passed away, and his family and bannermen are gathered for the funeral.

The Lord of Riverrun is placed on a funeral pyre boat launched by Robb, [[Tytos Blackwood]], [[Jonos Bracken]], [[Jason Mallister]], [[Marq Piper]], [[Karyl Vance]] and Lothar Frey. Lothar is invited to take the place that would be [[Desmond Grell]]\'s as a gesture of goodwill towards House Frey, as an effort from Robb to apologize for his failure to keep his vow of marrying a Frey. [[Edmure Tully|Edmure]] tries to launch a fire arrow at the ship to light it but he misses three times. He gives the bow to [[Brynden Tully]], who hits the boat, causing it to catch fire. \n\nLater, Robb is devastated by the news from [[Battle of Duskendale|Duskendale]], shocked that [[Robett Glover]] and [[Helman Tallhart]] took it upon themselves to attack such an insignificant castle, losing nearly a third of Robb\xe2\x80\x99s infantry; he later states his intention to exchange Robett for their captive [[Martyn Lannister]]. The king tells [[Catelyn Tully|Catelyn]] of [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]]\xe2\x80\x99s marriage to the [[Tyrion Lannister|Imp]]. Catelyn begs him to bend the knee and make peace with the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]], but Robb will not hear it. At dinner, Lothar tells them that his father received word from [[Walder Frey (son of Merrett)|Little Walder]] and [[Walder Frey (son of Jammos)|Big Walder]] at the [[Dreadfort]], that [[Sack of Winterfell|Winterfell had been burned]] and [[Rodrik Cassel]] killed. Lothar remarks that the [[Ramsay Bolton|Bastard of Bolton]] rescued the survivors from [[Winterfell]], to Catelyn\xe2\x80\x99s disbelief. Lothar brings his father\xe2\x80\x99s terms that Robb appear in person to offer apology, and that Edmure marry [[Roslin Frey]] immediately.

The [[Maester#Grand Maester|Grand Maester]] denies this, explaining that he visits the young queen to give her sleeping potions, but [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] knows otherwise. Forcing a confession from him that he also brings Margaery [[moon tea]], she then commands him to announce that Lord Rosby\'s dying wish was to donate all his lands and incomes to the Crown. \n\nLady [[Taena of  Myr|Taena]] wonders how Margaery could be so foolish, but Cersei is too excited to care. She does realize that she will need more proof in order to have Margaery executed for treason, knowing that she must arrange to have the girl caught in the act. She asks Taena and her husband to bring the [[Blue Bard]] to dinner that night. \n\nDuring the meal, Cersei demotes Ser [[Harys Swyft]] to Lord Treasurer, and with the position of [[Hand of the King|Hand]] now vacant, she offers the title to Lord [[Orton Merryweather]]. Lord Orton accepts, although he is notably uncomfortable during the dinner, particularly due to the presence of Margaery\'s favorite singer.\n                  \nCersei wastes little time moving on to the Blue Bard, accusing him of sleeping with Queen Margaery. The singer denies it, despite Cersei smashing him in the face with his own lute, and even later in the black cells under interrogation by [[Qyburn]]. But the defrocked maester tortures the singer into submission, and they lead him to say what they want. He accuses several others of also having carnal knowledge of Margaery, and then Cersei promises that he will be allowed to take the black after he confesses in front of the court. \n\nLater, Taena persuades Cersei to name [[Alla Tyrell|Alla]] as innocent, since they may be able to use her to bear witness against Margaery and her other cousins. At breakfast, [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] mentions that Margaery will be at the Sept for [[Maiden\'s Day]]. \n\nCersei then launches the final move of her scheme, commanding Ser [[Osney Kettleblack|Osney]] to go before the High Septon and admit his sins of &quot;bedding&quot; Margaery, [[Elinor  Tyrell|Elinor]] and [[Megga Tyrell|Megga]]. The youngest Kettleblack agrees to do so, but states, &quot;\'\'The best lies have some truth in \'em... to give \'em flavor, as it were\'\',&quot; so the Queen Regent then allows him to have his way with her.\n\n==References and Notes== \n*The  synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at  [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/08/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-feast-for-crows-part-28 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Feast for Crows, Part 28].

He urges Ned to admit to treason, command [[Robb Stark|Robb]] to lay down his sword, and denounce [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] and [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]]. When Eddard states that his life is not worth forsaking his honor, Varys tells him that Cersei has [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]], whose life is also at stake.\n\n==Synopsis==    \n[[Eddard Stark|Ned]]\xe2\x80\x99s cell contains nothing but straw that stinks of urine. There are no windows, so the darkness is absolute. Ned thinks back to [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]]\xe2\x80\x99s words, \xe2\x80\x9cThe king eats and the [[Hand of the King|Hand]] takes the shit,\xe2\x80\x9d and thinks, \xe2\x80\x9cThe king dies, and the Hand is buried.\xe2\x80\x9d The cell is deeper under the [[Red Keep]] than Ned dares imagine. He remembers the story of [[Maegor I Targaryen|Maegor the Cruel]] murdering the masons to keep the castle\xe2\x80\x99s secrets. He also remembers [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]]\xe2\x80\x99s words, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you play the game of thrones, you win or you die,\xe2\x80\x9d and he knows that he has played and lost. He wants to weep, but he is still a [[House Stark|Stark]] of [[Winterfell]] and his grief and rage freeze inside him.\n\nAs his injured leg throbs, Ned damns them all, but can only blame himself; he was a fool. To keep himself sane, he thinks and plans aloud. [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] and [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]] [[House Baratheon|Baratheon]] are likely gathering armies at [[Dragonstone]] and [[Storm\'s End]]. [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] will raise [[the North]] and the armies of [[Riverlands|River]] and [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]] will join her.\n\nAs time drags on, Ned finds himself thinking more and more of Robert Baratheon as he was in the flower of his youth. In the darkness of his cell he can hear Robert ask him, \xe2\x80\x9cGods, how are we come to this? You here, and me killed by a pig.\xe2\x80\x9d Ned broods on how he failed Robert by hiding the truth and letting them kill him. When Ned is half asleep, a jailer arrives with water, which he drinks eagerly. He asks the jailer for news but is ignored.\n\n[[File:Rhaeg lyanna-winterfelll.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The moment when all the smiles died - by M.Luisa Giliberti\xc2\xa9]]\n\nAs his solitude grows, Ned vividly remembers when he was eighteen at the [[Tourney at Harrenhal]]. He remembers [[Brandon Stark|Brandon]]\xe2\x80\x99s laughter, Robert\xe2\x80\x99s valor in the melee, [[Jaime Lannister]] joining the [[Kingsguard]], and [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] defeating Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] in the final joust. Then Ned remembers the moment when all the smiles died, as Rhaegar rode past [[Elia Martell|his own wife]] to lay the queen of beauty\xe2\x80\x99s laurel in [[Lyanna Stark|Lyanna]]\xe2\x80\x99s lap. It was a crown of winter roses, which Lyanna loved the scent of. In his delirium, Eddard grasps the laurel, but there are thorns underneath and blood trickles down his fingers. Then he remembers his promise to Lyanna again, and weeps that he is going mad.\n\nThe jailer continues to come with a jug of water each day, but no food, and eventually Ned no longer asks questions. He is sure that Cersei will not kill him as long as Catelyn holds [[Tyrion Lannister|the Imp]].\n\nA new jailer arrives with wine instead of water. The voice that tells him to drink is familiar; it is [[Varys]] in a very effective [[Rugen|disguise]]. Varys tells him that [[Arya Stark|Arya]] escaped (which is for the best since Joffrey has no love for her), and that [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] is still betrothed to Joffrey and kept close by the queen. Sansa [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 57|pleaded]] for his life in court a few days previous. Ned reminds Varys that Cersei will not kill him because Catelyn holds her brother. Varys replies that Tyrion is the wrong brother. Besides, Catelyn has let Tyrion escape and he is probably now dead in the [[Mountains of the Moon]]. \n\nNed accuses Varys of standing by while his guards were slaughtered; Varys makes no apologies since he was unarmed, unarmored, and surrounded by Lannister soldiers. Varys continues by telling Ned that he plays his part: a courageous informer would be as useless as a cowardly knight. Ned asks if Varys will free him, but Varys points out that he would be the prime suspect. When asked if he will deliver a message, Varys admits that he will read it and then decide if it serves his purpose first. When asked his purpose, Varys states that it is peace. \n\nVarys tells Ned that he struggled to keep Robert alive and protected him from his enemies for fifteen years, but could not protect him from his friends. Then Varys asks what madness led Ned to tell the queen he knew the truth of Joffrey\xe2\x80\x99s birth. Ned says it was the madness of mercy; he had hoped to save the children\xe2\x80\x99s lives. Varys remarks that he often forgets that Ned is one of the few honest men in the world, but when he sees the reward Ned has earned he understands why.\n \nNed then asks if Varys questioned [[Lancel Lannister]] about the wine. Varys explains that Cersei gave Lancel the wineskins and told him it was the king\xe2\x80\x99s favorite vintage. In any case, if it had not been the boar, it would have been some other form of accident because Cersei needed to be rid of Robert to deal with his brothers: Stannis the iron gauntlet and Renly the silk glove. Varys then points out that Ned should have taken [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger\xe2\x80\x99s]] advice and supported Joffrey. Ned is shocked that Varys knows about the offer.\n\nVarys then informs Ned that the queen will visit him the next day. She is frightened of him, but fears other enemies more: [[Jaime Lannister]] fights the [[Riverlands|river lords]], [[Lysa Arryn]] is no friend, [[House Martell|the Martells]] lust for vengeance for the murdered [[Elia Martell|Elia]] and her babes, and [[Robb Stark]] marches down [[the Neck]]. Robb may only be a boy, but he is a boy with an army. Then there is Stannis who has a true claim to the throne, is a skilled military tactician, and is utterly without mercy. Most of all, Cersei fears that while [[Tywin Lannister|her father]] battles the Starks and their allies, Stannis will descend on King\'s Landing, kill her and her children, and proclaim himself king.\n\nHowever, Varys explains, Cersei knows \xe2\x80\x9ca tame wolf is more use than a dead one,\xe2\x80\x9d but telling her Stannis is the true heir will only lose Ned his head. Ned asks if he is expected to serve the woman who killed his king and crippled his son. Varys replies that he expects Ned to serve the realm: admit his treason, command Robb to lay down his sword, denounce Stannis and Renly, and carry Cersei\xe2\x80\x99s secret to the grave. Cersei knows Ned is a man of honor and will let him join his [[Benjen Stark|brother]] and his [[Jon Snow|bastard son]] in the [[Night\'s Watch]]. The thought of Jon brings shame and deep sorrow to Ned.\n\nNed accuses Varys of being Littlefinger\xe2\x80\x99s man, but Varys denies it, saying Littlefinger is the second most devious man in the kingdom. Varys only feeds him choice whispers so that Littlefinger thinks he is his, just like the queen. Ned agrees that sounds just like Varys and asks whom the eunuch truly serves. Varys replies that he serves the realm, and the realm needs peace. \n\nWhen Varys asks what his answer will be, Ned says his life is not as precious as his honor. Varys points out that neither he nor the queen has forgotten about Sansa. Caught off-guard by this, Ned begs Varys to leave Sansa out of his schemes, insisting his daughter is just a child. Varys notes that [[Rhaenys Targaryen (daughter of Rhaegar)|Rhaenys Targaryen]] was also a child when the Lannisters broke down her door. As he leaves he tells Ned that the next visitor can bring him either food and [[milk of the poppy]] or Sansa\xe2\x80\x99s head. The choice, Varys says, is up to Ned.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/10/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-28 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/059/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 58]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Eddard Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 59, Eddard]][[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\xad\xd0\xb4\xd0\xb4\xd0\xb0\xd1\x80\xd0\xb4 XV]]</text>\n      <sha1>oyj4xu5cmywqhw7e5o90cb5uz0ivlmt</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Feast for Crows-Chapter 9</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5674</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166941</id>\n      <parentid>122086</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-06-05T18:20:34Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4258">{{Infobox Chapter AFfC\n| pov\t\t= [[Brienne of Tarth]]\n| title\t\t= Brienne II\n| place         = [[Duskendale]]\n| page\t\t= 130\n| previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 8|Jaime I]]\n| current\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 9|Brienne II]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 10|Sansa I]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 4|Brienne I]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 14|Brienne III]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n\nWhen [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]] reaches [[Duskendale]], she finds the gates barred for the night. The area surrounding it is littered with corpses of both northmen and men from [[the Reach]].&lt;ref&gt;Brienne specifically describes, in order, the sigils of [[House Glover]], [[House Hornwood]], [[House Karstark]] and [[House Cerwyn]], that she correctly identifies as Northern Houses; and also Houses from the Reach such as [[House Fossoway of Cider Hall]], [[House Fossoway of New Barrel]], [[House Leygood]], [[House Ambrose]] and [[House Tarly]]. Stormlands Houses\' sigils were also implied, yet unconfirmed.&lt;/ref&gt; \n\nThe gates open at morning, and the captain tells Brienne that his sister can paint over the black bat of [[House Lothston|Lothston]] on her shield. After finding and telling the sister what sigil she wants, Brienne heads to the [[Dun Fort]] to speak to the lord. Since Lord [[Renfred Rykker|Rykker]] is in the field, she meets with the castellan Ser [[Rufus Leek]] and a maester, who tells her that many came before her asking if [[Dontos Hollard]] and [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] had come to Duskendale. The Dun Fort\'s maester tells the story of the [[Defiance of Duskendale]], which seems to have been the incident that finally sent [[Aerys II Targaryen|King Aerys]] over the edge.\n\nEither of his own initiative, or from the urgings of [[Serala|his wife]], [[Denys Darklyn]] took Aerys hostage. When [[Tywin Lannister]] (who was [[Hand of the King|Hand]] at the time) surrounded the Dun Fort, Lord Darklyn threatened to kill Aerys. When Aerys was captured, [[Symon Hollard]] killed one of his kingsguard, Ser [[Gwayne Gaunt]]. \n\nAfter [[Barristan Selmy|Barristan the Bold]] slipped into the Dun Fort and rescued the king, Aerys had nearly every member of the [[House Darklyn|Darklyn]] and [[House Hollard|Hollard]] families killed or attainted. [[Dontos Hollard|Dontos]], who was young at the time, survived because Barristan asked Aerys to stay his hand. \n\nThe castellan tells Brienne that Duskendale would have been the last place Dontos would have fled to. Despairing that she will never find Sansa, Brienne bumps into a skinny boy whom she also saw back at [[Rosby]] on a [[old piebald rounsey|piebald rounsey]], but he runs away.\n \nVisiting the [[Seven Swords]] inn for dinner, Brienne meets a [[pious dwarf]], who tells her that he overheard a man called Nimble [[Dick]] in [[Maidenpool]] bragging that he had \'\'&quot;fooled a [[Shagwell|fool]]&quot;\'\' seeking passage for three across the [[Narrow Sea]]. That night, Brienne dreams of [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]]\'s death, but when he topples after the shadow killed him, the body is that of [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]. \n\nThe next day, Brienne picks up her shield, painted with the sigil that [[Tanselle]] had painted for Ser [[Duncan the Tall]]. Proceeding to Maidenpool, Brienne camps by the ruins of the Hollard castle, and hears a rider. Fearing it may be Ser [[Shadrich]] and that a battle might ensue, she discovers the boy who seems to be stalking her. It turns out to be [[Podrick Payne]], who asks to stay with her, hoping that if she finds Sansa, it may lead the boy back to [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]].\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References}}\n\n*The synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/03/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-feast-for-crows-part-6 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Feast for Crows, Part 6].

Emmett hits Jon hard and Jon is knocked into thoughts of [[Winterfell]] and his boyhood rivalry with Robb. Part of him always wanted to become Lord of Winterfell and resented that it was impossible for him. These feelings come up so strong that he beats Emmett mercilessly and has to be pulled off him.  Jon goes to the bathhouse, and overhears Ser [[Alliser Thorne|Alliser]] and [[Bowen Marsh]] mentioning that Lord [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] sent a letter backing [[Janos Slynt]]\xe2\x80\x99s rise to Lord Commander. They show it to [[Othell Yarwyck]], seeking to have the First Builder withdraw and back Slynt. Jon is disturbed by the prospect of Slynt becoming Lord Commander, and goes off through the gate beyond [[the Wall]]. He is torn between his duties to the Watch, and the chance [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] has given him to become Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell. As he is considering that he has always wanted this, his thoughts change to a hunger for food. No, not food but prey - deer or elk.\xc2\xa0When he looks up, [[Ghost]] comes padding over. He is overjoyed to see his old friend.   \n\nJon looks at the direwolf\xe2\x80\x99s red eyes. Recalling what [[Melisandre]] said about there being no [[old gods]], only the [[Lord of Light]] and the Other, Jon realizes that while Ghost\'s eyes are red, they are not like Melisandre\xe2\x80\x99s. He has a [[Weirwood|weirwood\xe2\x80\x99s]] eyes and belongs to the old gods. His mind made up, he attends the voting council for the first time. He is greeted with shouts of disapproval from Slynt and Thorne, learning that his name has been put forth as Lord Commander. Seeking to end the voting, Ser Alliser mentions that Othell Yarwyck has something to say, but the First Builder abandons their plotting, and withdraws in favor of Jon.

On his way to Riverrun and King\'s Landing, he encounters [[Brienne of Tarth]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] arrives at [[Raventree Hall]], under siege by [[Jonos Bracken]]. The siege here is much smaller than the one at [[Riverrun]] as the intentions are not to storm the castle but rather to starve them out. The siege has been going on for six months and there is not much hope of rescue for [[Tytos Blackwood]] as it is only a matter of time.\n\nJaime meets first with Lord Jonos who is in an intimate position with [[Hildy]]. After she leaves, Jaime inquires as to what Jonos seeks from the situation. Jonos insists on acquiring a quarter of the [[House Blackwood]] lands, saying that they were stolen from them long ago, and that [[Tywin Lannister]] promised them to Jonos if he subdued the Blackwoods. Jaime chides the [[House Bracken|Bracken]] man saying that they were once an enemy of the king when they sided with the [[House Stark|Starks]], and keeping his head is more than enough compensation for what the [[Gregor Clegane|Mountain]] did to his lands. Bracken protests that he will keep faith with the crown as he did with the Starks; Jonos adds that a dozen good men of his died at the [[Red Wedding]] with [[Robb Stark]] and he bent the knee because he saw no point in fighting on for a lost cause. Jaime remarks that Lord Jonos is a prudent man on hearing this, yet privately thinks Blackwood might be considered more honorable.  \n\nJaime then goes to parley with [[Tytos Blackwood]]. Inside he sees the castle\'s massive [[weirwood]] tree from which the castle derives its name; the tree is black and leafless. Tytos tells Jaime that it is the fault of the Brackens, poisoned and barren for a thousand years, and in another thousand it will turn to stone as weirwoods never rot. As they treat, Jaime tells him that he does not have to physically kneel to him. They agree to a confession, fealty, pardon, and financial sum as well as lands. Finally they discuss the matter of a hostage, and Jaime asks for [[Bethany Blackwood|Bethany]], his daughter, but Tytos refuses as she is his only daughter. They eventually agree to sending [[Hoster Blackwood|Hoster]] as he is a bookish boy who may enjoy his time in [[King\'s Landing]] and all the books there. Jaime then leaves quickly as he has appointments in Riverrun and King\'s Landing. The boy is ready to leave with him within an hour. Before departing, he meets Ser Jonos to tell him the resolution, but also informs him that a daughter of his is to attend to the queen in the capital, as she too is to be a hostage.\n\nJaime rides to the village [[Pennytree]] with Hoster, who tells him of the history of the lands and animosity between the Blackwoods and Brackens. In the village stands an ancient oak tree with pennies nailed to it, the namesake of the village. There, [[Brienne of Tarth]] finds them, bandaged on her face, and with the sword [[Oathkeeper]]. Brienne claims that she has found [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]], and that Jaime must accompany her alone or else [[Sandor Clegane]] will kill the girl.&lt;ref&gt;Brienne was last seen in \'\'[[A Feast for Crows]]\'\', [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 42|Chapter 42]]; Sansa, in \'\'[[A Feast for Crows]]\'\', [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 41|Chapter 41]]; and Sandor, in \'\'[[A Storm of Swords]]\'\', [[A Storm of Swords-Chapter 74|Chapter 74]].

As Catelyn and Ser [[Rodrik Cassel|Rodrik]] arrive for [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]]\'s trial-by-combat they meet Ser [[Brynden Tully|Brynden]], who has resigned his post and plans to join the defense of [[Riverrun]]. In the duel, [[Bronn]] kills Ser [[Vardis Egen]] and Lysa sets Bronn and Tyrion free outside the [[Bloody Gate]] to take their chances with the [[Vale mountain clans]].\n\n==Synopsis==    \n\n[[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] watches dawn break over the [[Eyrie]]. Below is the waterfall called [[Alyssa\'s Tears]], named after [[Alyssa Arryn|a woman]] who had seen her husband, brothers, and all her children slain but never shed a tear. Catelyn wonders how large a waterfall her own tears will make when she dies.\n\nShe asks and Ser [[Rodrik Cassel|Rodrik]] continues with his news. Ser [[Jaime Lannister]] is gathering an army at [[Casterly Rock]]. Catelyn\xe2\x80\x99s brother [[Edmure Tully|Edmure]] writes that he has commanded Lords [[House Vance of Wayfarer\'s Rest|Vance]] and [[Clement Piper|Piper]] to guard the pass below the [[Golden Tooth]]. Edmure\xe2\x80\x99s letter goes on to declare that he will yield no foot of [[House Tully|Tully]] land without soaking it in [[House Lannister|Lannister]] blood. Catelyn is in a foul mood and asks why the letter makes no mention of [[Hoster Tully|their father]], the lord of [[Riverrun]], who must be very sick to give the defense over to Edmure. \n\nWhen Catelyn says that she should have been woken immediately when the letter arrived, Ser Rodrik explains that [[Lysa Tully|Lysa]] thought it was better to let her sleep. He also mentions that her sister plans to speak with her after the combat. Catelyn declares the combat a [[mummer]]\xe2\x80\x99s farce, angry that Lysa cannot see [[Tyrion Lannister]] has tricked her. In Catelyn\xe2\x80\x99s opinion it is past time that she and Ser Rodrik leave for [[Winterfell]], planning to take a ship north from [[Gulltown]]. Ser Rodrik pales at the thought of another sea voyage.\n\nAs the servants dress her, Catelyn hopes that she can talk to her sister before the duel. The shy girl Catelyn knew at Riverrun has grown into a vain and inconstant woman. When the message came that Tyrion wanted to confess, Catelyn had tried to convince Lysa to talk to the dwarf in private, but her sister insisted on a public show.\n\nAs they come to the doors of Lysa\xe2\x80\x99s apartment, Ser [[Brynden Tully|Brynden]] the Blackfish is coming out. He is angry that Lysa has refused to grant him a thousand men to aid the defense of the [[riverlands]]. He declares that he has resigned as Knight of the [[Bloody Gate]] and will go alone. Concerned about her uncle travelling the [[high road]] alone, Catelyn suggests he return to Winterfell with them and receive his thousand men from her. Ser Brynden agrees and Catelyn and Ser Rodrik enter Lysa\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\n\nLysa\xe2\x80\x99s apartments overlook a grassy area scattered with statues (the remnants of a failed attempt to plant a [[godswood]]) where the duel will take place. An elegant looking Lysa is holding court on the terrace, surrounded by her many suitors. The young Lord [[Robert Arryn|Robert]] is in a chair on an elevated platform being entertained by a puppeteer. \n\nCatelyn attempts to explain to Lysa that they have nothing to gain by executing [[Tyrion Lannister]] and everything to lose if his champion should succeed. Lysa and her suitors insist that any knight is superior to a common [[sellsword]] like Bronn. Having seen [[Bronn]] fight on the high road, Catelyn is much less certain. Trying another approach, Catelyn argues that the Lannisters (especially [[Jaime Lannister]]) will not be satisfied that they had a trial before executing Tyrion. [[Lyn Corbray]] insists that Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s head will serve as a warning to the Lannisters, but Lysa insists that her son wants to see Tyrion fly as if it settles the matter. Catelyn attempts one final time to stop the trial by claiming Tyrion is \'\'her\'\' prisoner. Lysa merely rants that Tyrion killed her husband and she means to see him pay.\n\nSer Rodrik asks Catelyn quietly if she truly thinks Tyrion did it. She states that she believes the Lannisters murdered [[Jon Arryn]], but she cannot say whether it was [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]], Jaime, or Tyrion; Lysa named Cersei in her letter, but now she seems certain it was Tyrion, perhaps because she has Tyrion as her captive. Ser Rodrik agrees that poison could be the work of Tyrion or Cersei, but Jaime is too fond of blood to have used poison. Catelyn wonders how else they could have made it look a natural death.\n\nWhen Catelyn hears her nephew shriek in delight at the antics of the puppets, she states that the boy is too undisciplined; he will never be strong enough to rule unless he is taken away from Lysa. [[Maester]] [[Colemon]], having overheard this, pipes in that Jon Arryn agreed and was planning to send the boy to [[Dragonstone]]. Catelyn corrects him that it was [[Casterly Rock]], but the maester insists it was Dragonstone.\n\nTyrion Lannister is led forward and Robert asks if he can make him fly. Then the two champions appear from either side of the garden. Ser [[Vardis Egen]] is armored in plate from head to toe with a narrow slit for vision. Bronn looks almost naked by comparison, wearing only a half helm, a mail coif, and ringmail over boiled leather. However, Catelyn notices that Bronn is 15 years younger and half a hand taller, with a greater reach than Ser Vardis,\n\nThe [[septon]] calls upon the gods before making a hasty departure. Robert is impatient for the fight to start. The knight\xe2\x80\x99s heavy kite shield is strapped to his arm by a squire. When offered a shield, Bronn refuses. The knight is handed an elegant double-edged sword that Lysa announces belonged to Jon Arryn for ceremonial occasions. Lysa explains that she thinks it is only fitting that Ser Vardis avenge Lord Arryn with his own blade, but Catelyn notices that Ser Vardis shows some discomfort with the strange sword. Finally, Robert is allowed to initiate the fight. After an initial probing exchange, Bronn starts to leap away from the knight\xe2\x80\x99s advances. The crowd starts declaring that Bronn is craven, but Ser Rodrik tells Catelyn that Bronn is trying to tire the knight. \n\nAs she watches the fight, Catelyn remembers the duel between [[Brandon Stark]] and [[Petyr Baelish]]. When Brandon saw the limited armor Petyr was wearing, he took off most of his own armor. Petyr had begged her for a favor, but her father had promised her to Brandon. As she had given the favor to Brandon, Catelyn had begged him to not kill Petyr and he had agreed. The fight was ended quickly with a deep cut to Petyr\xe2\x80\x99s ribs, which Catelyn was sure was fatal. That was the last time she had seen Petyr [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 18|until King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing]].\n\n[[File:Felicia Cano i fight to win.JPG|thumb|400px|right|Bronn traps Ser Vardis \xe2\x80\x94 \xc2\xa9 Fantasy Flight Games]] \n\nWhen Catelyn returns her attention to the fight she can tell Bronn is quicker. Robert complains that the combatants are not fighting properly, but his mother assures him that the [[sellsword]] cannot run all day. Eventually Ser Vardis is addled by a fall, and loses sight of Bronn because of his narrow visor. Bronn uses this opportunity to place a serious blow to the knight\xe2\x80\x99s elbow. Now the knight\xe2\x80\x99s parries begin to grow slower and lower and Bronn attacks with more energy. Blind to the fact that Ser Vardis is losing, Lysa calls for him to finish the sellsword as if he were delaying the end on purpose. The knight charges and Bronn almost loses his balance but manages to jump back from the blow and push a statue onto the knight. With Ser Vardis pinned under the fallen statue, Bronn delivers the killing blow and a silence falls over the crowd. \n\nRobert asks if it is over, and Lysa is forced to admit it is. Robert then asks if he can make the little man fly and Tyrion joyfully says, \xe2\x80\x9cNot this little man.\xe2\x80\x9d When Lysa makes a thinly veiled threat to execute Tyrion anyway, the dwarf asks if Lysa remembers [[House Arryn]]\xe2\x80\x99s words: \xe2\x80\x9cAs High as Honor.\xe2\x80\x9d Robert insists that he wants to make Tyrion fly, but Lysa is forced to admit that the gods have proclaimed Tyrion innocent. She orders Tyrion and Bronn escorted to the [[Bloody Gate]] and provided with supplies, but they must take the high road alone. Everyone in the court recognizes the proclamation as another sort of death sentence. Tyrion favors Lysa with a mocking bow, saying he and Bronn already know the way.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/08/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-20 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/041/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==    \n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 40]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Catelyn Tully]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in the Eyrie]]\n\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 41, Catelyn]]\n[[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\x9a\xd0\xb5\xd0\xb9\xd1\x82\xd0\xb8\xd0\xbb\xd0\xb8\xd0\xbd VII]]</text>\n      <sha1>l8zdr9wwxvhfnb7vhdpl3ot082jrl1b</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Game of Thrones-Chapter 45</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6029</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>165988</id>\n      <parentid>117883</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-17T14:21:16Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8317">{{Infobox Chapter AGoT\n| pov\t\t= [[Eddard Stark]]\n| place         = [[King\'s Landing]]\n| title\t\t= Eddard XII\n| page\t\t= 401\n| previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 44|Sansa III]]\n| current\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 45|Eddard XII]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 46|Daenerys V]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 43|Eddard XI]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 47|Eddard XIII]]\n}} __NOTOC__\n\n[[Eddard Stark|Ned]] now knows the truth [[Jon Arryn]] died for. He also learns from [[Pycelle]] and [[Littlefinger]] that Lord [[Tywin Lannister]] is preparing for a war. Later, Ned meets with Cersei and tells her that he will tell [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] the truth when he returns, offering her the chance to flee and save her children. Cersei warns that Ned has made a mistake.\n\n==Synopsis==    \n[[Maester#Grand Maester|Grand Maester]] [[Pycelle]] tells [[Eddard Stark|Ned]] that the pain means that the bone is healing, but Ned only replies that he will be happy when his leg stops throbbing. Pycelle provides him with the [[milk of the poppy]] for the pain, but Ned says he sleeps too much already. Pycelle tells him sleep is good for healing.\n\nPycelle informs Ned that Queen [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] has received a letter from her father. Lord [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] is angry about Ned sending men to bring Ser [[Gregor Clegane]] to justice. Ned replies that it does not bother him; Lord [[Beric Dondarrion]] rides under the king\xe2\x80\x99s banner and if Lord Tywin attempts to interfere he will have [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] to answer to, and the only thing Robert likes better than hunting is making war on defiant lords. Pycelle leaves, telling Ned that he will come again the next day.\n\nNed knows Pycelle is Cersei\xe2\x80\x99s creature, and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care. He is not actually confident in Robert, but he does not want Cersei to know that. He calls for honeyed wine, which will not cloud his mind as badly as the milk of the poppy, because he needs to think. Ned thinks how sometimes a child\xe2\x80\x99s innocent eyes can see things that grown men are blind to and how some day he will have to tell [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] how she made it all come clear to him.\n\n[[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] pays a visit an hour after Pycelle leaves, bringing news that [[Varys]] has heard whispers that [[sellsword]]s are flocking to [[Casterly Rock]]. Ned asks about Robert and is told that, having found the white hart dead, the king is now after a fierce boar. Most of the hunting party has returned, however, including Prince [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] and [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]]. Littlefinger states that he would have liked to have seen the Hound\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to learning that [[Beric Dondarrion]] is after the [[Gregor Clegane|brother]] he hates. With that Littlefinger leaves for a dinner, but not before noting the book of \'\'[[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms]]\'\', and teasingly asking if it is a sleeping potion.\n\nNed considers that, outside of his retainers, there is not a man in the city he trusts: Littlefinger leaving before the [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 35|slaughter]] of his guard rankles him, Varys knows too much and does too little, Pycelle is Cersei\xe2\x80\x99s, and Ser [[Barristan Selmy|Barristan]] is too old and rigid in his sense of duty. \n\n[[Arya Stark|Arya]] and Sansa will sail in three days. Ned knows that honor will require him to go to Robert with all he knows when he returns. Last night he dreamed of when Lord Tywin had presented the bodies of Prince [[Rhaegar]]\xe2\x80\x99s children to Robert. Ned remembers that Robert could be merciful if a man were brave and honest; he had pardoned Ser Barristan, Varys, Pycelle, [[Balon Greyjoy]], and Littlefinger and let them keep their office for an offer of fealty. However poison in the dark he will never forgive and would kill them all. [[Bran Stark|Bran]] must have learned some part of the truth; otherwise they would not have tried to kill him. Ned decides that he must find a way to save the children.\n\nNed calls in [[Tomard|Fat Tom]], now in command of his guardsmen and asks to be taken to the [[godswood]]. Ned also orders the guard doubled despite the shortage of manpower. Ned sends Tom to find Queen Cersei and give her a letter inviting her to join him. As he sits in the godswood, Ned feels the presence of his gods under the faceless [[heart tree]] and his leg does not seem to hurt as much. \n\nWhen Cersei arrives at nightfall, Ned notes that she is proudly displaying the bruise Robert has given her. For the first time in a long time, Ned can see her beauty. When he declares that he knows the truth [[Jon Arryn]] died for, Cersei scoffs whether he has brought her here to pose riddles or to kidnap her. Ned replies that if she believed such things she would not have come. He then asks about the bruise, and if Robert does such things often. She replies that it has never been on the face before and that her brother Jaime would have killed Robert if he knew. \n\n[[File:Winona Nelson The Only Game that MattersII.JPG|350px|thumb|right|\xc2\xa9 Fantasy Flight Games]]\n\nWhen Ned suggests a correction of \xe2\x80\x9cbrother\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9clover,\xe2\x80\x9d Cersei does not trouble to deny it. Cersei admits that she and Jaime have been lovers since they were children and that when Jaime is in her she feels whole. When Ned asks about his son Bran, Cersei admits that he saw her and Jaime, offering her love for her own children as a reason for the attempted murder. Ned counters with a declaration that all three of Cersei\xe2\x80\x99s children are Jaime\xe2\x80\x99s. The last time a [[House Baratheon|Baratheon]] had a child with a [[House Lannister|Lannister]] was 90 years before when [[Tya Lannister]] wedded [[Gowen Baratheon]]; the single child was large and lusty boy with a full head of black hair. Thirty years before that a Lannister had taken a Baratheon maid; all the children had black hair. According to \'\'[[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms]]\'\', the children of a  Lannister and a Baratheon always had black hair.\n\nNed asks Cersei how it is possible that she never had a child by the king, and she admits she almost did but had the child aborted. Cersei goes on to claim that she cannot stand to even touch Robert now, and has not let him inside her for years. Instead she pleasures the king in other ways when he leaves his whores long enough; Robert is always so drunk that he never remembers.\n\nWhen Ned asks what made her hate Robert so much, Cersei reveals that on their wedding night Robert called her \xe2\x80\x9c[[Lyanna Stark|Lyanna]]\xe2\x80\x9d in the midst of the consummation. The story leads Ned to declare that he does not know which of them to pity more, but that he must still do his duty. Cersei makes a sexual advance on Ned while telling him that the realm needs a strong Hand and that he will never regret being kind to her. Ned immediately rejects the advance by asking if she made the same offer to [[Jon Arryn]] and she slaps him. Offended by Ned\xe2\x80\x99s honorable persona, Cersei brings up [[Jon Snow]] and accuses Ned of many other possible debaucheries.\n\nNed makes it clear that he intends to tell Robert everything when he returns and warns Cersei to leave [[King\'s Landing]]. He recommends that she take a ship to the [[Free Cities]] with all her immediate family, including [[Tywin Lannister|her father]], to escape Robert\xe2\x80\x99s wrath. Cersei stands, laughs, and declares Ned a fool for not taking the throne himself fourteen years before, when he forced Jaime to surrender the seat. Ned replies that he has made more mistakes than Cersei can imagine, but that was not one of them. Cersei insists that it was, saying &quot;When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground.&quot;\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/09/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-22 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/046/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 45]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Eddard Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 46, Eddard]][[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\xad\xd0\xb4\xd0\xb4\xd0\xb0\xd1\x80\xd0\xb4 XII]]</text>\n      <sha1>cri7kk9c9tqigrxa5w0q097w6foxmab</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Feast for Crows-Chapter 36</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5976</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166967</id>\n      <parentid>142454</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-06-05T19:23:50Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5144">{{Infobox Chapter AFfC\n| pov\t\t= [[Cersei Lannister]]\n| title\t\t= Cersei VIII\n| place         = [[King\'s Landing]]\n| page\t\t= 529\n| previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 35|Samwell IV]]\n| current\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 36|Cersei VIII]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 37|Brienne VII]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 32|Cersei VII]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 39|Cersei IX]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis== \n\nLord [[Aurane Waters]] has returned from [[Dragonstone]] with news that the fortress has fallen. This was good news indeed, considering that word from the [[Reach]] mentioned the ironmen raiding the [[Arbor]] and pushing towards [[Oldtown]]. Aurane indicates that Ser [[Loras Tyrell|Loras]] was grievously wounded during the assault and lay dying after having had boiling oil poured on him from the walls; he also holds Loras responsible for turning the battle into a massacre, as thousands of the Crown\'s soldiers died in the storming of Dragonstone\'s keep, many of them knights or lords. Ecstatic, [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] had to deliver the news personally to [[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]]. The young queen is appalled by Cersei\'s description of the fate of her brother, and commands Cersei to get out of her quarters. Back in her solar, four separate men bring word on a dwarf sighting, and one brings her a head. However, none of them bear word related to [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]], and Cersei sends them away in frustation. Later, in court, Cersei must deal with several unimportant pleas, and then Septon [[Raynard]] arrives. Furious that the [[High Septon]] himself did not come before her, she scoffs at his words that the [[Faith of the Seven|Faith]] is trying to abolish the brothels in the city. \n\n[[Pycelle]] brings word that Lord [[Gyles Rosby|Gyles]] may not live much longer, but Cersei demands that the Grand Maester do his utmost to keep the old man alive. At dinner with her son, [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] mentions that Margaery has been urging him to attend court, to which Cersei responds how much she\'d like to see the young queen\'s tongue torn out. Tommen yells at his mother, but she commands Ser [[Boros Blount|Boros]] to chastise the boy king\'s [[Pate (King\'s Landing)|whipping boy]]. During the night, Cersei dreams of her visit to the woods witch back when she was 10 years old. She vividly recalls [[Maggy|Maggy the Frog]]\'s plea that they leave her, but Cersei and [[Melara Hetherspoon|Melara]] will not back down. Maggy commands them to cut open their thumbs, and the old easterner tastes their blood. She prophesized that Cersei would marry the [[Robert Baratheon|king]] (not the [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Prince]], as Cersei thought), but her husband would father 16 children and Cersei only three, and that she would reign as queen only &quot;until there comes another, younger and more beautiful, to cast you down and take all that you hold dear... Gold shall be their crowns and gold their shrouds. And when your tears have drowned you, the \'\'valonqar\'\' shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.&quot; Maggy also warns that Melara will die very soon, and true enough, she drowns in a well shortly after. \n\nWaking from the nightmare, she sends for Pycelle to make her a potion that permits sleep without dreams. She asks him if seeing the future is possible, but the old maester evades answering by saying, &quot;Should our morrows be foretold? And to that I should answer, \'No.\' Some doors are best left closed.&quot; Aggravated, she sends for [[Qyburn]], first asking if [[Falyse Stokeworth|Falyse]] was still capable of being used to root out [[Bronn]]. But the necromancer tells her it is too late for that. Then she inquires of him the same she had asked of Pycelle. We learn that Maggy was from the far east, and had married a wealthy merchant. Their son was &quot;upjumped&quot; to a petty lord by Cersei\'s grandfather. Qyburn tells her that the name Maggy was probably a mispronunciation of &quot;maegi&quot;,  and that bloodmagic was very powerful. The de-chained maester suggests that she already knew how to forestall the prophecy. Seizing upon this suggestion, Cersei plans a fool-proof way to have Margaery killed. Deciding that treason would work best, the next day she inquires of Ser [[Osmund Kettleblack|Osmund]] if his brother [[Osney Kettleblack|Osney]] could defeat Ser Boros in single combat. He replies that it wouldn\'t even be a match, and wonders if Boros has commited treason. Cersei replies no, but thinks to herself: But Osney has.\n\n==References and Notes== \n*The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/08/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-feast-for-crows-part-26 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Feast for Crows, Part 26].

After several poor contests, [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] becomes enraged when Ser [[Dontos Hollard]] arrives half naked and too drunk to compete. Sansa manages to convince Joffrey to make Dontos his new fool instead of executing him. Afterward, while Prince [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] is riding against a quintain, [[Tyrion Lannister]] arrives to assume his position as acting [[Hand of the King]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:Sansa Stark.jpg|thumb|170px|left|Sansa Stark \xe2\x80\x93 by Amok \xc2\xa9]]\n\n[[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] is watching the long tail of the [[red comet]] from her tower window when Ser [[Arys Oakheart]] arrives to escort her to the [[tourney on King Joffrey\'s name day]]. She asks him what it means. Ser Arys declares that it means glory to her betrothed, King [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]]; the gods have raised it as a banner in his honor, and the smallfolk have named it \xe2\x80\x9cKing Joffrey\xe2\x80\x99s Comet\xe2\x80\x9d. Sansa is not so sure and replies that she has heard the servants call it the \xe2\x80\x9cDragon\xe2\x80\x99s Tail.\xe2\x80\x9d Ser Arys replies that Joffrey sits on [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Dragon]]\xe2\x80\x99s [[Iron Throne|throne]] and crimson is the color of [[House Lannister]], so it must mean he will triumph over his enemies. Sansa wonders apprehensively if this is true, since her [[Catelyn Stark|mother]] and [[Robb Stark|brother]] are among Joffrey\xe2\x80\x99s enemies. Yet Joffrey is a [[House Baratheon of King\'s Landing|Baratheon]] as much as a Lannister, so his comet should be gold.\n\nSer Arys compliments Sansa on her gown, whose long sleeves hide the bruises given to her by Ser [[Boros Blount]] at Joffrey\xe2\x80\x99s command when he learned that her brother [[Robb Stark|Robb]] had been proclaimed [[King in the North]]. Of all the [[Kingsguard]], Ser Arys is always courteous to Sansa, and is her preferred escort since he is the only one who objects to hitting her and never hits hard. The others all obey without question, except [[Sandor Clegane]], but Joffrey never commands the [[Hound]] to hit her. \n\nAs they walk, Sansa asks who will win the tourney. Ser Arys states he will, though there will be only 40 contestants, and there is small honor in unhorsing green boys. Sansa muses that this will be very different from the magnificent [[Hand\'s tourney]]. With King [[Robert I Baratheon|Robert]] dead and three kings vying for power it is not surprising that Joffrey\xe2\x80\x99s tourney must be held within the [[Red Keep]]. Sansa asks if Queen [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] will attend, but learns that the queen has urgent business with the [[small council]]. Ser Arys also mentions that Cersei is furious that [[Tywin Lannister]] will not bring his army to the city as commanded.\n\nThe pitiful crowd in the small outer bailey fills only half the seats. Most of the spectators are [[City Watch of King\'s Landing|gold cloaks]] or wear the crimson of House Lannister. Only a few are nobility: grey-faced Lord [[Gyles Rosby]], Lady [[Tanda Stokeworth]] with her daughters [[Falyse Stokeworth| Falyse]] and [[Lollys Stokeworth|Lollys]], the exiled prince [[Jalabhar Xho]], and Lady [[Ermesande Hayford]], who is only a baby.\n\nThe Hound announces Sansa\xe2\x80\x99s arrival at the royal box. Princess [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]] gives a shy nod, but Prince [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] excitedly tells her that he is to ride in the tourney. Joffrey quickly interjects that Tommen will be riding against a straw quintain. After Ser Arys excuses himself, Joffrey studies Sansa and declares he is pleased she wore the stones he gave her. Sansa is relieved that Joffrey has chosen to play the gallant today.\n\n[[File:MagaliVilleneuve JoffreyBaratheon.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Joffrey Baratheon \xe2\x80\x93 \xc2\xa9FFG]]\n\nOnce Sansa is seated, Joffrey informs her that the Beggar King [[Viserys Targaryen]] is dead. Joffrey is amused by the irony of a [[House Targaryen|dragon king]] being [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 46|killed]] with a molten gold crown. He suggests that perhaps he will feed Sansa\xe2\x80\x99s brother Robb to wolves and boasts that he intends to challenge Robb to single combat. Sansa states that she would like to see that. Joffrey is suspicious of her meaning, so Sansa distracts him by asking if he will compete today. Joffrey responds that his mother claims it would not be fitting for him to compete in his own tourney, otherwise he would be champion. When asked to concur, the Hound says, \xe2\x80\x9cAgainst this lot? Why not?\xe2\x80\x9d When Sansa asks the Hound if he will joust, the scarred man replies that it would not be worth the bother, since this is a tourney of gnats. Joffrey suggests he should make the Hound fight the champion to the death, but the Hound replies that Joffrey would only be one knight the poorer (and the Hound is not a knight). \n\nWhen the trumpets sound, Joffrey takes Sansa\xe2\x80\x99s hand, which repulses her, but she forces herself to be still. \n\nIn the first joust, Ser [[Meryn Trant]] of the Kingsguard defeats Ser [[Hobber Redwyne]] on the second pass. The [[House Redwyne|Redwyne]] twins are hostages like Sansa, and she doubts they entered the tourney voluntarily. Joffrey is disappointed by the poor show. Next, Ser [[Balon Swann]] faces the new-made squire [[Morros Slynt]], who is having difficulty with his lance. The sight of [[Janos Slynt]]\xe2\x80\x99s heir takes Sansa back to the day her father was beheaded; it was Janos Slynt who threw her father down and held him while Ser [[Ilyn Payne]] swung the sword. Her prayer for Morros to embarrass himself is answered when the former commoner is violently unhorsed. Joffrey hoots in derision, telling Tommen that they picked the wrong foe for him, Morros jousts worse than a quintain. Then it is Ser [[Horas Redwyne]]\xe2\x80\x99s turn. He fares better than his twin, unhorsing an old knight bedecked with silver griffins who makes a poor contest. Disgusted, Joffrey declares this a feeble show. He is getting bored and his mood is darkening, which worries Sansa.\n\n[[File:Dontos Hollard.jpg|thumb|300px|left|\xe2\x80\x9dI lose! Fetch me some wine&quot; \xe2\x80\x93 \xc2\xa9FFG]]\n\nNext, Ser [[Dontos Hollard]] is called to face the freerider [[Lothor Brune]]. Brune takes his place, but Ser Dontos arrives drunk and half naked, struggling to catch and mount his horse. The audience all laugh at the drunken knight\xe2\x80\x99s antics except for Joffrey. Eventually, Dontos gives up trying to mount, sits down in the dirt, forfeits the match, and asks for more wine. Joffrey stands and shouts, \xe2\x80\x9cA cask from the cellars! I\xe2\x80\x99ll see him drowned in it.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nWithout thinking, Sansa protests and is immediately shocked that she dared, given Joffrey\xe2\x80\x99s mood. He turns on her, furious at being gainsaid, and Sansa struggles to make up a story that it is a curse to kill a man on one\xe2\x80\x99s name day. Joffrey does not believe her, but the Hound comes to her rescue by agree that, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a man sows on his name day, he reaps throughout the year.\xe2\x80\x9d Joffrey reluctantly agree to have the fool killed on the morrow. Sansa seizes the opportunity to suggest that Joffrey make Dontos wear motley and clown for him as a fool instead of executing him; he does not deserve the mercy of a quick death. Joffrey likes this idea and agrees. Ser Dontos thanks both Joffrey and Sansa.\n\nOnce Ser Dontos has been led away, the master of revels inquires whether he should summon a new opponent for Lothor Brune or proceed with the next tilt. Instead, Joffrey calls off the tourney in disgust, saying he would have them all put to death if it weren\'t his name day. Tommen vehemently protests that he was supposed to ride against the quintain. An argument among the royal siblings ensues. When Myrcella finally points out that their mother agreed, Joffrey mocks her for being childish, but Myrcella points out that they \xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99are\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 children. The Hound, laughing, tells Joffrey that she has a point. Joffrey sullenly agrees. \n\nTommen\xe2\x80\x99s opponent is a child-sized quintain wearing a helmet with antlers. Tommen hits it solidly, but it spins around to strike Tommen on the back of the head, unhorsing him. This incites a gale of laughter from the crowd, most of all from King Joffrey. Princess Myrcella rushes out to help her brother to his feet. Sansa, with queer courage, suggests that Joffrey should accompany her to help and tell Tommen he rode well. Joffrey angrily refuses, stating that getting unhorsed is not riding well. However, Tommen shows courage when he prepares to try again. Sansa finds herself wishing that Tommen was the eldest child; she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind marrying him.\n\nJust then, the portcullis rises and the gates of the Red Keep open. A column of dusty horsemen enter under the golden lion banner of House Lannister. Some of the horsemen wear the armor of Lannister men-at-arms but the majority are freeriders, sellswords, and [[Vale mountain clans|monstrous savages]]. In their midst rides [[Tyrion Lannister]], the ugliest man Sansa has ever set eyes upon. Tommen and Myrcella rush to greet their uncle and Sansa is stunned to see that Tommen and Tyrion are the same height. \n\nAfter greeting his niece and nephew, the dwarf waddles over to Joffrey, shadowed by a [[Bronn|black-haired sellsword]] and a [[Timett|one-eyed savage]]. When Tyrion greets him, Joffrey expresses surprise at Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s arrival and the Hound comments that they heard Tyrion was dead. Myrcella expresses happiness that he is alive. Tyrion thanks her and then gives his condolences to Joffrey and Sansa for the loss of their fathers. Sansa is speechless, wondering if Tyrion is mocking her. Joffrey is momentarily confused until Tyrion reminds him that his own father, King Robert, has also recently died. Joffrey responds \xe2\x80\x9cOh, him. Yes, it was very sad, a boar killed him.\xe2\x80\x9d Tyrion asks him if that is what \xe2\x80\x98they\xe2\x80\x99 say. Sansa, armoring herself in courtesy, apologizes to Tyrion for his [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 28|abduction]] by her mother. Tyrion thanks Sansa for the sentiment, telling her that many people are sorry, and some will be even sorrier.\n\n[[File:Thaldir Tyrion\'s Enforcers.jpg||thumb|300px|right|Tyrion Lannister \xe2\x80\x93 \xc2\xa9FFG]]\n\nThen, Tyrion asks Joffrey where he might find Queen Cersei. Joffrey answers that she is with the small council; [[Jaime Lannister]] keeps losing battles and was captured, [[Battle of the Camps|Riverrun]] was lost, and Robb is calling himself king. Tyrion comments that all sorts of people are calling themselves kings these days. Suspicious of the comment, Joffrey tells Tyrion stiffly that he is happy he is alive, and asks about a gift for his name day. Tyrion responds that he has brought his wits, and Joffrey replies he would prefer Robb\xe2\x80\x99s head. Before Joffrey departs with Myrcella and Tommen, the Hound tells Tyrion to guard his tongue. Sansa is left alone with Tyrion and his monsters. \n\nUnable to think of anything else to say, Sansa comments on Tyrion\'s injured arm. Tyrion tells her that a northman hit him with a morning star, but he escaped by falling off his horse. Tyrion asks if it is mourning for her father that makes Sansa so sad. Sansa reflexively insists that her father, mother, and brother are traitors and that she is loyal to her beloved Joffrey. Tyrion is unconvinced and responds by comparing her to a deer surrounded by wolves. Sansa, without thinking, whispers \xe2\x80\x9cLions.\xe2\x80\x9d The dwarf gently takes her hand and assures her that he is only a little lion and means her no harm, then departs.\n\nSansa notes that Tyrion speaks to her more gently than Joffrey, but then she remembers that Queen Cersei once spoke gently as well. She reminds herself that Tyrion is still a Lannister and that she must never trust a Lannister again.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n\n* [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2011/03/re-read-sansa-i-princess-schmincess.html Review of the chapter in the course of a 10th reread]\n* [http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2010/02/sansa-tyrion.html Humorous review of the chapter]\n* [http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/01/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-2 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 02]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Sansa Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 2]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 03, Sansa]]\n[[zh:&amp;#21015;&amp;#29579;&amp;#30340;&amp;#32439;&amp;#20105;-&amp;#31456;&amp;#33410; 2]]</text>\n      <sha1>606gn1i54jvuizze9yw613opwis6wqo</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Game of Thrones-Chapter 49</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6033</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>165992</id>\n      <parentid>134927</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-17T14:22:00Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6753">{{Infobox Chapter AGoT\n| pov\t\t= [[Eddard Stark]]\n| place         = [[King\'s Landing]]\n| title\t\t= Eddard XIV\n| page\t\t= 437\n| previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 48|Jon VI]]\n| current\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 49|Eddard XIV]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 50|Arya IV]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 47|Eddard XIII]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 58|Eddard XV]]\n}} __NOTOC__\n[[File:paper shield.jpg|370px|thumb|right|A paper shield. \xc2\xa9 Fantasy Flight Games]]\n[[File:King\'s Landing CoupLukasz Jaskolski.jpg|370px|thumb|right|King\'s Landing Coup. \xc2\xa9 Fantasy Flight Games]]\nAfter King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]]\xe2\x80\x99s death, [[Eddard Stark|Ned]] convenes the [[small council]] to confirm him as Protector of the Realm. However, the council is interrupted by a summons to the throne room where King [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] demands oaths fealty. Queen [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] destroys Robert\xe2\x80\x99s will and Ned declares Joffrey has no right to the [[Iron Throne]]. When Ned calls for the [[City Watch of King\'s Landing|City Watch]] to seize Cersei and her children, the gold cloaks instead kill Ned\xe2\x80\x99s men, and Littlefinger reveals his betrayal.\n\n==Synopsis==    \n[[Eddard Stark|Ned]] wakes to the thunder of [[House Lannister|Lannister]] guardsmen drilling in the yard and curses [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] for not fleeing despite his warnings.\n\nAt breakfast, [[Arya Stark|Arya]] is given permission for a short lesson with [[Syrio Forel]] as long as she is ready to leave by midday. [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]], who is very despondent, asks again to see Prince [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] before she leaves. [[Faith of the Seven#Septa|Septa]] [[Mordane]] offers to escort Sansa, but Ned insists it is not wise. Sansa complains it is not fair and runs weeping from the solar. Septa Mordane rises to follow but Ned stops her, declaring that he will try to explain when they return to [[Winterfell]].\n\nAn hour later, [[Grand Maester]] [[Pycelle]] arrives with news that King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] is dead. Although he has been expecting the news, Ned is surprised by the emptiness it leaves inside him, as if part of him has died as well. Suppressing his grief, Ned orders Pycelle to convene the [[small council]] in the [[Tower of the Hand]], not trusting the security of the council chamber. The Grand Maester objects that they can wait a day, but Ned insists so Pycelle dispatches servants to carry the summons. \n\nSer [[Barristan Selmy]] arrives first and asks permission to attend King [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] instead, but Ned refuses. When [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] arrives wearing the same clothes as the previous day, he declares that the task Ned set him is done. [[Varys]] arrives next with news that Lord [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]] has left the city along with Ser [[Loras Tyrell]] and fifty retainers, slipping out a postern gate an hour before dawn and riding south for [[Storm\'s End]] or [[Highgarden]]. Ned is discomforted by the news, since he had remained hopeful of Renly\xe2\x80\x99s support.\n\nNed entrusts Ser [[Barristan Selmy|Barristan]] to read the writ naming him Protector of the Realm until the heir comes of age. Ned thinks to himself that the [[Stannis Baratheon|true heir]] is already of age, but says nothing; he does not trust Varys or Pycelle and Ser Barristan is honor bound to protect the boy he thinks is his rightful king. The need for deceit bothers him, but Ned knows he must keep Cersei\xe2\x80\x99s secret until he is firmly established as regent. There will be plenty of time to deal with the succession when his daughters are safe and Stannis has arrived with his forces. Ned asks the council to proclaim him Protector of the Realm as Robert wished. Before anyone can reply, the meeting is interrupted by [[Tomard|Fat Tom]] and the royal steward with news that the king demands the small council\xe2\x80\x99s immediate presence in the throne room. Ned is unsurprised that Cersei would strike quickly, and orders Tom to assemble an escort.\n\nEscorted by eight men-at-arms and supported by Littlefinger, Ned makes his way across the yard, reassured by the number of Stark guardsmen on the walls. Inside the throne room, Joffrey sits the [[Iron Throne]] with Cersei and his siblings below, guarded by [[Sandor Clegane]] and all of the [[Kingsguard]] except [[Jaime Lannister]] and Ser Barristan, who has just arrived with Ned. Behind the throne stand twenty Lannister guardsmen armed with swords, and along the walls are a hundred [[City Watch of King\'s Landing|gold cloaks]] armed with spears, enough to outnumber the Lannisters five to one. At the sight of the gold cloaks, Ned is encouraged that Littlefinger has kept his promise.\n\nJoffrey stands and commands that the council make arrangements for his coronation which he wishes held within the fortnight. The young king then declares that today he will accept oaths of fealty from his loyal councilors. Ned has Varys deliver Robert\xe2\x80\x99s will to Cersei. The queen glances at the words then tears it up, questioning if Ned meant a piece of paper to be his shield. The honorable Ser Barristan exclaims that those were the king\xe2\x80\x99s words, but Cersei dismissively declares that they have a new king now. Then Cersei advises Ned that if he bends the knee and swears fealty to Joffrey he will be allowed to retire peacefully to Winterfell. Instead, bound by his honor, Ned declares that Joffrey has no right to the throne and that [[Stannis]] is the true heir. \n\nJoffrey bursts out in anger and Cersei orders Ser Barristan to seize Ned as a traitor. The old knight hesitates and is quickly surrounded by Ned\xe2\x80\x99s guardsmen. At Cersei\xe2\x80\x99s command, the Hound and the Lannister guardsmen draw their swords to aid in the arrest. Ned responds by ordering [[Janos Slynt]] to have his gold cloaks take the queen and her children into custody. As Ned is stating he wants no bloodshed, a gold cloak shoves a spear through Tomard\xe2\x80\x99s back. A brief fight ensues, quickly killing all of Ned\xe2\x80\x99s guardsmen. As Ned\xe2\x80\x99s men die around him, Littlefinger slides Ned\xe2\x80\x99s dagger from its sheath, holds it to his throat, and says, \n\n{{Quote|&quot;I did warn you not to trust me, you know.&quot;}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/09/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-24 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/050/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 49]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Eddard Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 50, Eddard]][[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\xad\xd0\xb4\xd0\xb4\xd0\xb0\xd1\x80\xd0\xb4 XIV]]</text>\n      <sha1>11nwj8yjetimer171o1prk0hjfu35ho</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Clash of Kings-Chapter 21</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6150</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166424</id>\n      <parentid>165575</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-23T20:48:11Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8639">{{Infobox Chapter ACfK\n| pov\t\t= [[Bran Stark]]\n| place         = [[Winterfell]]\n| title\t\t= Bran III\n| page\t\t= 237\n| previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 20|Tyrion V]]\n| current\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 21|Bran III]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 22|Catelyn II]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 16|Bran II]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 28|Bran IV]]\n}}\n\nActing as Lord of [[Winterfell]], [[Bran Stark|Bran]] hosts the [[harvest feast]] and greets [[Meera Reed|Meera]] and [[Jojen Reed]], who arrive to represent their father [[Howland Reed]].That night, Bran dreams of the Reeds visiting the [[direwolf|direwolves]] in the [[godswood]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Bran Stark|Bran]] rides his horse [[Dancer]] into the Great Hall of [[Winterfell]] for the [[harvest feast]]. He wishes [[Summer (direwolf)|Summer]] was with him, but Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]] was unyielding. From the crowded benches, men shout &quot;Stark!&quot; and &quot;Winterfell!&quot; as he passes. Bran knows they are cheering for the harvest, for victory, and for all the [[House Stark|Starks]] who came before rather than for him, but he still swells with pride and even forgets he is broken until he reaches the dais. There [[Osha]] and [[Hodor]] unstrap him and carry him to the high seat. Ser Rodrik, his daughter [[Beth Cassel|Beth]], and [[Maester]] [[Luwin]] are seated to Bran\'s left and [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]] to his right, his hair uncut since [[Catelyn Stark|their mother]] left because he bit the last girl to try. After Ser Rodrik bellows for quiet, Bran welcomes the guests and asks them to thank the gods for [[Robb Stark|Robb]]\'s victories and the bountiful harvest. His toast of &quot;May there be a hundred more,&quot; brings an echoing cheer and Ser Rodrik says [[Eddard Stark|his father]] would be proud.\n\nThey feast on course after course, including seafood brought by Lord [[Wyman Manderly]] from [[White Harbor]]. Manderly has also brought musicians,  but only [[Hodor]] seems to be listening and the songs are drowned beneath the talk and laughter. Ser Rodrik and Maester Luwin talk over Beth\'s head, while Rickon screams happily with [[Walder Frey (son of Merrett)|Little Walder]] and [[Walder Frey (son of Jammos)|Big Walder]]. Bran did not want the Walders at the high table but Maester Luwin reminded him they would become kin when Robb weds one of their aunts and Arya marries their uncle [[Elmar Frey]], though Bran argued Arya would never stand for that.\n\nEach dish is served to Bran first, and soon he is full and must nod approval rather than taste everything. As instructed, he sends particularly delicious dishes to the lords as a gesture of friendship: salmon to sad Lady [[Donella Hornwood]], boar to [[Mors Umber|Mors]] and [[Hother Umber]], goose-in-berries to [[Cley Cerwyn]], lobster to [[Joseth]] the master of horse for training Dancer, sweets to Hodor and Old [[Nan]] because he loves them, and beets and turnips to the Walders because Ser Rodrik insists he give them something.\n\nBran watches the feast detachedly, seeing everything yet a part of nothing. He sees Osha break a flagon over the head of a [[House Tallhart|Tallhart]] man for sliding his hand under her skirts, though another woman does not seem to mind [[Mikken]]\'s hand down her bodice. He watches [[Farlen]] make his red bitch beg and Old Nan pluck at the crust of a hot pie. On the dais, he sees Lord Manderly attacking a plate of lampreys in his special wide chair, sad Lady Hornwood picking listlessly at her food, and the Umber brothers playing a drinking game. \n\nThe heat and noise soon grow too much and Bran finds himself dreaming of the cool in the [[godswood]]. Studying his father\'s ornate goblet, Bran recalls the [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 5|welcoming feast]] for King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] and realizes everyone else is gone\xe2\x80\x94either to war, captivity, [[the Wall]], or their graves. Even the men at the tables are new, since everyone who went south with his father is dead and the rest rode to war with Robb. When he wonders who will be missing next year and the year after, Bran feels like crying but reminds himself he is the Stark in Winterfell and almost a man grown.\n\n[[File:Jojen and Meera Reed.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Meera and Jojen Reed - \xc2\xa9Amok]]\n\nThe doors to the hall open and [[Alebelly]] leads in two new guests: [[Meera Reed|Meera]] and [[Jojen Reed]] of [[Greywater Watch]]. Bran recognizes them as [[crannogmen]] from [[the Neck]], a shy and simple folk who rarely leave their swamps, but he hears Little Walder calling them &quot;mudmen&quot; and explaining to Rickon that they are thieves and cravens with green teeth from eating frogs. As places are hurriedly prepared on the dais, Ser Rodrik explains that these must be the children of [[Howland Reed]], a great friend and staunch companion of Bran\'s father during [[Robert\'s Rebellion]].\n\nThe slender girl Meera is armed with woven net, bronze knife, and frog spear as well as an iron helm, leather shield, and bronze-scale jerkin. Her younger brother Jojen is unarmed and dressed all in green, which brings out the deep green of his eyes. Kneeling before the dais, the Reeds explain that they have come to renew [[House Reed]]\'s fealty to the [[King in the North]]. Bran explains that Robb is away fighting but says they may say their words to him. Together, the Reeds recite their ancient oath, swearing by earth and water, by bronze and iron, and by ice and fire never to fail the Starks of Winterfell. Unsure how to respond, Bran finally decides on &quot;May your winters be short and your summers bountiful,&quot; and bids them rise. Meera offers gifts of fish, frog, and fowl, and Bran offers them the meat and mead of Winterfell in return.\n\nJojen immediately asks where the [[direwolf|direwolves]] are and Rickon answers that they are in the godswood because [[Shaggydog]] was bad. When Meera says that Jojen would like to see them, Little Walder warns that they will bite. Pleased by the Reeds\' interest, Bran promises that Summer at least will not bite and will keep Shaggydog away. He cannot recall ever meeting a crannogman and would like to talk more, but the feast is too noisy. When he learns from Ser Rodrik that they truly eat frogs, Bran sends the Reeds mutton, [[aurochs]], and beef stew, which they seem to like. When Meera catches him staring, Bran blushes.\n\nAfter the tables are cleared away, the music and singing grows wilder. Mors Umber grabs a passing serving girl and begins whirling her about the floor and others soon join in. Hodor dances by himself, while Wyman Manderly and then Cley Cerwyn partner with little Beth Cassel. Ser Rodrik approaches Lady Hornwood, but she excuses herself. Once again unable to participate, Bran watches long enough to be polite, then calls Hodor to carry him to bed, conscious of the stares of onlookers.\n\nJust outside the hall, they come upon Joseth and giggling woman with her skirts above her waist. The girl screams when she sees Hodor watching, so Bran has to tell him to leave them be. After getting help with his boots and breeches, Bran dismisses Hodor and lies down to sleep. Then he recalls his father telling him the [[Kingsguard]] were once a shining example, and the finest knight he ever saw was Ser [[Arthur Dayne]], who would have killed him but for Howland Reed. His father became sad at that and spoke no further, but now Bran wishes he had asked what he meant.\n\nBran goes to sleep thinking of knights, but his dreams are of wolves in the godswood again and he can hear and smell the feast still going on. At the rattle of iron, he and his brother race to confront the strange intruders: a female and a young male with no taint of fear. Bran recognizes Meera\'s voice when she asks if Jojen knew the wolves would be so big. Jojen points out they are still growing and opines that Shaggydog is full of fear and rage but Summer is stronger than he knows. Meera cautions her brother, but Jojen insists this is not the day he dies and reaches out to touch Summer.

Their goal is to reach [[Slaver\'s Bay]] and eventually [[Daenerys Targaryen]] in [[Meereen]] without drawing too much danger or attention, although they keep that a secret from their colleagues. \n\nThe company was paid for by [[Yunkai]] to fight and kill the [[Cleon|Butcher King]]\'s successors in [[Astapor]], where they are currently mounted, three miles away from the gates. There they faced Astapor\'s still-untrained new [[Unsullied]], far less formidable than those that Daenerys has with her in Meereen.{{Ref|ADWD|25|page 325-326}}\n\n&quot;Frog&quot; learns that the Windblown are going to Yunkai for provisions before marching for Meereen to fight Daenerys\' forces. While they prepare to leave, he learns many malicious and fearful rumors about Daenerys\' past and present, some of them more grounded in truth than others.{{Ref|ADWD|25|page 321}}\n\nOn the way to Meereen, the Tattered Prince receives instructions from Yunkai to hunt the Astapori survivors that have left the ruins of Astapor and drive them away from Yunkai, either back to Astapor or further north to Meereen. It is believed that about half of those survivors are carriers of the [[bloody flux]]. The Windblown will fight side by side with the [[Company of the Cat]], another group of sellswords that has fought against them in the past.\n\nThe leader of the company has however decided to play both sides, and selects a group of Westerosi men, including Quentyn and his companions, to make for Meereen and contact either the [[Second Sons]] or the [[Stormcrows]], offering to defect to Dany. He selects [[Pretty Meris]] to command that group and suggests believable justifications for their decision to turn cloak. The group will have to be careful to avoid retaliation from the Company of the Cat or of the [[Long Lances]] who know nothing of their plans and might not approve or care if they knew.\n\n==References==\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 25]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Quentyn Martell]]\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 25]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 26, Les Erre-au-Vent]]</text>\n      <sha1>4tuar26rddpa2ovcmqtpay6h3t7bnaz</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Clash of Kings-Chapter 52</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6223</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166455</id>\n      <parentid>120325</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-23T20:58:30Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3358">{{Infobox Chapter ACfK\n| pov\t\t= [[Sansa Stark]]\n| place         = [[King\'s Landing]]\n| title\t\t= Sansa IV\n| page\t\t= 548\n| previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 51|Jon VI]]\n| current\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 52|Sansa IV]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 53|Jon VII]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 32|Sansa III]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 57|Sansa V]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n[[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] meets again with Ser [[Dontos Hollard|Dontos]] in the godswood, and learns that he hears more things as a fool than he ever did as a knight.

Dontos tells her that [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] burned the [[godswood]] at [[Storm\'s End]] at the behest of the [[Melisandre|Red Woman]]. When Sansa asks him to make good on his promise, Dontos tells her the time is not right for their escape. Dontos does promise her that when his friend returns to [[King\'s Landing]], they will have a ship to escape on. \n[[File:Luaprata91 sandor sansa eve of battle.JPG|Sansa and Sandor atop Maegor\'s Holdfast. \xc2\xa9 Luaprata91|thumb|300px|right]]\nSansa does not want to return to her room yet, so she goes up to the roof, where she is surprised by [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]]. Clegane is in a foul mood as ever, and tells her that he enjoys killing, and that only cowards fight with fire. He claims he fears no man, but Sansa thinks that he does fear [[Gregor Clegane|his brother]]. Once again, he assures her that there are no [[true knight]]s. \n\nThat night, Sansa has a dream where she is surrounded by a mob, and calls out to all the great knights, but none respond to her call. She feels herself bleeding, and awakes to find the sheets soaked with blood. She realizes that she just had her first [[flowering]], and burns the sheets in fear that [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] will find out and want to bed her. Her maids catch her and bring her before [[Cersei Lannister|the Queen]], but Cersei comforts her, knowing the girl is frightened at the prospect of marrying Joffrey. She tells her how difficult Joffrey was to bear, and how [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] was out hunting when Joffrey was born. Cersei informs her that while Sansa may not love Joffrey, she will love the children she bears him. The Queen also reveals that Robert always wanted to be loved, to have friends and be cheered, and that her brother [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] had the same disease. She tells Sansa: \'\'&quot;Love is poison. A sweet poison, yes, but it will kill you all the same.&quot;\'\'\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n* [http://slynt.blogspot.com/2012/01/re-read-sansa-iv-once-in-red-moon.html Analyses and summary of the chapter] in the course of a 10th reread by Slynt.\n* [http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/06/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-25 Review and summary] by Leigh Butler.\n* The synopsis was copied from AOL member vbkorik27 previously at [http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html].\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Clash of Kings: Chapter 52]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Sansa Stark]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place at the Red Keep]]\n[[es:Choque de Reyes-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 52]]\n[[fr:A Clash of Kings, Chapitre 53, Sansa]]</text>\n      <sha1>o4i928rh5wet5q5r0co9jpkra86edkk</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Feast for Crows-Chapter 28</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5667</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166957</id>\n      <parentid>142446</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-06-05T19:17:32Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5007">{{Infobox Chapter AFfC\n| pov\t\t= [[Cersei Lannister]]\n| title\t\t= Cersei VI\n| place         = [[King\'s Landing]]\n| page\t\t= 410\n| previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 27|Jaime III]]\n| current\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 28|Cersei VI]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 29|The Reaver]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 24|Cersei V]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 32|Cersei VII]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] and [[Taena of Myr|Taena]] share the queen\'s litter en route to the [[Great Sept of Baelor]]. The lady from [[Myr]] is telling Cersei about all the men who are always around [[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]], and how she was present for the bedding at [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]]\'s wedding. Although Taena is not sure if Margaery is still a maiden, she affirms that Renly was aroused. She also lets on that besides all the [[Knight|knights]] and bards, [[Pycelle]] is a frequent visitor of the young queen, and her brother [[Loras Tyrell|Loras]] visits perhaps more than any other. They also discuss the new [[High Septon]], a man who was once a &quot;[[Sparrows|sparrow]]&quot; and not a member of the [[Most Devout]]. This is not only surprising, but also of concern to Cersei, and she considers that she may have to poison this new leader of the Seven, if he becomes unruly. \n\nReaching the top of [[Visenya\'s hill|Visenya\'s Hill]], the queen\'s litter can continue no further as the streets are packed with &quot;sparrows&quot;. Continuing on foot, Cersei considers Pycelle\'s objection to her choice of [[Osfryd Kettleblack]] to replace [[Addam Marbrand]] as the commander of the City Watch. She takes note of all the bones and skulls piled up around the statue of Baelor, and is told that they are the remains of septons and septas who  were killed by the war, because they received no protection from the Throne. At the doors to the Great Sept, armed men block the [[Kingsguard]]s\' entry since they bear weapons. Cersei must enter alone, and as she does she wonders about these anointed knights answering the call to defend [[the Faith]].\n\nInside the Sept, she is appalled to find Septon [[Raynard]] in roughspun robes scrubbing the floors, and learns that Septon [[Torbert]] has been imprisoned for being obese when so many are starving. She berates the new High Septon, this &quot;sparrow&quot; wearing frayed robes and standing before her barefoot. He tells her that the Faith has sold the crown her father gave his predecessor, as well as all the valuables in their vaults, in order to help feed the poor. Cersei recalls [[Qyburn]]\'s report that the &quot;sparrows&quot; broke down the doors of the Sept before the final vote with axes in their hands and their leader on their shoulders. She now understands how this man was elected High Septon. Speaking in private, the priest reprimands her for beheading [[Eddard Stark|Ned Stark]] on the steps of the Great Sept, and reveals that he hasn\'t come to the [[Red Keep]] to bless King [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] because he is still praying for guidance from [[Faith of the Seven#The Seven|the Seven]] to affirm that the boy is the rightful king. The Queen Regent begins to seethe with anger, but concedes to his concerns that the holy men and women on the roads need protection from rape and murder: Cersei agrees to have Tommen rearm the Faith, something King [[Maegor I Targaryen|Maegor]] forbade almost 300 years ago. She promises to restore the [[Faith Militant]], for which the High Septon will acknowledge Tommen as king and forgive the Crown\'s debt to the Faith.\n\nBack in her litter, Cersei tells Taena of her triumph: with one stroke she has gotten the Faith to bless Tommen, reduced the Throne\'s debt by almost a million dragons, and cleared the city of &quot;sparrows&quot; by restoring the [[Faith of the Seven#Faith Militant|Warrior\'s Sons]] and the [[Faith of the Seven#Faith Militant|Poor Fellows]]. Yet she doesn\'t realize the repercussions of what she has set in motion. On the way back to the Red Keep, Cersei\'s litter encounters Margaery\'s entourage returning from a horse ride and picnic. Margaery tells Cersei that she should share some of the burden of ruling the realm. But Cersei laughs at her, especially when the young queen tells her she is always well protected by her brother Loras when she goes riding.\n\n==References and Notes==   \n*The synopsis was copied from Aol member vbkorik27 previously at[http://web.archive.org/web/20080228051425/members.aol.com/vbkorik27/summary/legend.html]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/06/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-feast-for-crows-part-20 A Read of Ice and Fire: A Feast for Crows, Part 20].

Stalwart Shield was visiting a brothel alone when he was set upon by the [[Sons of the Harpy]], a secret society raised in opposition to Daenerys\' rule and targeting her supporters for assassination (particularly ex-slaves). She orders an investigation, but has little hope that the culprits will be found.\n\nShe discusses her situation with [[Barristan Selmy]]. Her Dothraki are attempting to subdue the hinterlands of Meereen, while [[Brown Ben Plumm]] is in the north, defending against a feared attack from [[Yunkai]]. [[Daario Naharis]], whom she secretly loves, is in the east attempting to make an alliance with the [[Lhazareen]]. After leaving the dead man she calls on her dragon [[Viserion]], noting that all three of her dragons are growing larger and wilder. She dons a [[tokar]] and holds court.\n\n[[Skahaz mo Kandaq]] of the shaven head recommends that the great families of Meereen must be punished for the murders at the hands of the Sons of the Harpy. [[Reznak mo Reznak]], her [[w:seneschal|seneschal]], denies that the murderers are connected to the great families. Daenerys hears an embassy from the new king of Astapor, Cleon, who is asking both for her hand in marriage and support in a war against Yunkai. She tells the ambassador that Cleon should feed his own people before marching out to war.\n\nThe next petitioner is [[Hizdahr zo Loraq]], a wealthy Meereenese noble, who wants Dany to reopen the fighting pits of Meereen. She refuses him for the sixth time and ponders whether she should take him as a husband in order to solidify her rule over the city. She hears a number of other petitioners, including shepherds who are claiming that her dragons have devoured their sheep. Reznak sends them all away, promising they will be compensated for their loss, but one man remains behind. He empties out a sack of burnt bones on the marble floor. To her horror Dany realizes they are not the bones of a sheep - they belong to a child.\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n*[[Barristan Selmy]]\n*[[Irri]]\n*[[Jhiqui]]\n*[[Grey Worm]]\n*[[Stalwart Shield]] (dead)\n*[[Viserion]]\n*[[Reznak mo Reznak]]\n*[[Skahaz mo Kandaq]]\n*[[Ghael]]\n*[[Hizdahr zo Loraq]]\n*[[Grazdan zo Galare]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Missandei]]\n*[[Drogo|Khal Drogo]]\n*[[Ben Plumm|Brown Ben Plumm]]\n*[[Daario Naharis]]\n*[[Jorah Mormont]]\n*[[Drogon]]\n*[[Rhaegal]]\n*[[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]]\n*[[Galazza Galare]]\n*[[Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaegar)]]\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n*[[Rhaegar Targaryen]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Viserys Targaryen]]\n*[[Rhaenys Targaryen (daughter of Rhaegar)|Rhaenys Targaryen]]\n*[[Oznak zo Pahl]]\n*[[Belwas|Strong Belwas]]\n*[[Mirri Maz Duur]]\n*[[Cleon|Cleon the Great]]\n*[[Xaro Xhoan Daxos]]\n*[[Elza]]/[[Elza|Ella]]\n|}\n\n==Places and Terms Mentioned==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[Dothraki Sea]]/[[Dothraki Sea|Great Grass Sea]]\n*[[Lys]]\n*[[Volantis]]\n*[[Astapor]]\n*[[Yunkai]]/[[Yunkai|Yellow City]]\n*[[Meereen]]\n*[[Astapor]]\n*[[Temple of the Graces]]\n*[[Westeros]]\n*[[Khyzai Pass]]\n*[[Lhazar]]\n*[[Great Pyramid]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[Skahazadhan]]\n*[[Ghis]]\n*[[Westeros]]\n*[[Myr]]\n*[[Seven Kingdoms]]\n*[[Trident]]\n*[[Vaes Dothrak]]\n*[[Qarth]]\n*[[Tolos]]\n*[[Elyria]]\n*[[New Ghis]]\n*[[Plaza of Purification]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[Queensguard]]\n*\'\'[[khaleesi]]\'\'\n*[[Dothraki]]\n*\'\'[[hrakkar]]\'\'\n*[[Unsullied]]\n*[[Sons of the Harpy]]\n*[[Wise Masters]]\n*[[Dragon]]\n*[[Good Masters]]\n*[[Blue Graces]]\n*\'\'[[khalasar]]\'\'\n*[[Bloodrider]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[Second Sons]]\n*[[Lamb Men]]\n*[[Stormcrows]]\n*[[Tokar]]\n*[[Green Grace]]\n*[[House Targaryen]]\n*[[Battle of the Trident]]\n*[[Great Masters]]\n*[[High Valyrian]]\n*[[Slaver Cities]]\n*[[House of Zhak]]\n*[[House of Hazkar]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[House of Ghazeen]]\n*[[House of Merreq]]\n*[[House of Loraq]]\n*[[House of Pahl]]\n*\'\'[[Joso\'s Prank|Joso\'s Cock]]\'\'\n*[[Undying Ones]]\n*[[Andals]]\n*[[Rhoynar]]\n*[[First Men]]\n*[[Fighting pits]]\n*[[Mother\'s Men]]\n|}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 02]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Daenerys Targaryen]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Meereen]]\n\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 2]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 03, Daenerys]]</text>\n      <sha1>fok1rxkd8wk5evacz4rhv7dw2mjl4rz</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Feast for Crows-Chapter 42</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>5982</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166973</id>\n      <parentid>142460</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-06-05T19:27:55Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3267">{{Infobox Chapter AFfC\n| pov\t\t= [[Brienne of Tarth]]\n| title\t\t= Brienne VIII\n| place         = the [[Riverlands]]\n| page\t\t= 546\n| previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 41|Alayne II]]\n| current\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 42|Brienne VIII]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 43|Cersei X]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 37|Brienne VII]]\n| arc next\t= \n}}\n==Synopsis==\n\n[[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]] fluctuates between a fever dream and semi-consciousness, as the outlaws transport her severely injured body to Lady [[Catelyn Tully|Stoneheart]]. While she is being treated by [[Jeyne Heddle]], Brienne learns that [[Biter]] is dead, skewered through the head by a spear wielded by [[Gendry]]. [[Lem]], now wearing [[Sandor Clegane|Sandor]]\'s steel dog helm, tells her that Stoneheart wants her hanged for her &quot;crimes&quot;. Brienne fully awakens in [[hollow hill|a cave]], where she meets [[Thoros of Myr]]. The red priest is a ghost of his former self, and he informs her about the current state of the former [[Brotherhood Without Banners]]: &quot;Lord [[Beric Dondarrion|Beric]]\'s fire has gone out of this world... A grimmer shadow leads us in his place... War makes monsters of us all.&quot;                    \n\nBefore long, Brienne is brought before Lady Stoneheart, where she as well as [[Podrick Payne|Pod]] and Ser [[Hyle Hunt|Hyle]] will be judged. Brienne cannot see Stoneheart\'s face, but notices her holding a bronze crown ringed by iron swords. A northman, most likely [[Harwin]], places [[Oathkeeper]] before Stoneheart, along with Brienne\'s writ signed by King [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]]. The outlaws see this as irrefutable proof that the Maid of Tarth is about [[House Lannister|Lannister]] business. Her words are wasted here, as her pleas of innocence fall on deaf ears. Finally, Lady Stoneheart speaks, needing to place her hand over her throat in order to gurgle out her judgment. Upon removing her hood, Brienne is horrified to discover that the Hangwoman is actually Lady Catelyn Stark, albeit now a specter from the grave. Thoros reveals that it was Lord Beric himself who administered the kiss of life to her, finally extinguishing his own unnatural life. \n\nStoneheart gives Brienne an ultimatum: kill Ser [[Jaime Lannister]] or be hanged. When the Maid states that she will not make that choice, the thing that had been Catelyn Stark orders them hanged.

Now [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] waits with her guards as her son leads his host to [[Battle in the Whispering Wood|ambush]] Ser [[Jaime Lannister]]. Once the battle is over, Robb returns with Jaime as a captive. However, the death of several of Robb\'s party mars the sweetness of the victory.\n\n==Synopsis==    \n[[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] is protected by thirty men under the command of [[Hallis Mollen]], [[Winterfell]]\'s captain of the [[House Stark guards|guard]], as [[Robb Stark|Robb]]\xe2\x80\x99s host waits to descend upon Ser [[Jaime Lannister]] in the [[Whispering Wood]]. Robb had wanted to leave her fifty guards and Catelyn had only wanted ten, so neither of them left happy. \n\nRobb\xe2\x80\x99s army rode hard from the [[Twins]] to catch Jaime by surprise. Along the way, they were joined by the [[House Mallister|Mallisters]] and some of the forces scattered after [[Edmure Tully|Edmure\xe2\x80\x99s]] [[Battle under the walls of Riverrun|defeat]], but Ser Jaime Lannister still outnumbers them three to one. However, in order to besiege [[Riverrun]] the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] were forced to separate their twelve thousand foot and two or three thousand horse into three camps separated by rivers, which leaves them vulnerable. In addition, Catelyn\xe2\x80\x99s uncle, Ser [[Brynden Tully|Brynden]], led a screening force of three hundred picked men to kill the few outriders that Jaime bothered to post, allowing their advance to remain secret.\n\nBefore they face the siege, however, Robb and his men have concocted an elaborate trap. Unable to endure the boredom of a siege, Jaime has personally ridden out three times to chase raiders. To exploit this, Robb sent a few hundred men with [[House Tully|Tully]] banners to lure Jaime and his men into an ambush in the narrow valley of the Whispering Wood.\n\nAs she waits, Catelyn realizes that she is again waiting for a man who has promised to return from war, as she has done all her life. First, she waited for [[Hoster Tully|her father]] when she was young. Then it was for [[Brandon Stark]], who never came back. Then she waited for [[Eddard Stark|Ned Stark]], who left a fortnight after he married her to fight in [[Robert\'s Rebellion]]. At least Ned left her pregnant with Robb, whom she must wait for now.\n\nRobb shows no fear as the battle approaches, but Catelyn still fears for the life of her son, remembering him as a babe at her breast. As Robb\xe2\x80\x99s squire [[Olyvar Frey]] helps with his shield and helm, Catelyn sees a tall young knight appear where her son had stood. Robb leaves her to let his men see him before the battle, as his father had once recommended, with his [[direwolf]] [[Grey Wind]] shadowing him.\n\n[[File:MathiaArkoniel Jaime capture.jpg|thumb|260px|left|The Kingslayer is taken.]]\n\nWhile she waits, Catelyn hears [[snow shrike]]s, which remind her of Winterfell. Suddenly, horns blow and arrows fly as the trap closes. Catelyn can initially see the moonlight on the lances, but soon she can only hear the sounds of the [[battle in the Whispering Wood]]. Eventually the sounds fade, and then Robb returns on a different horse with the blood of one of his bodyguards on his arm. They drag Jaime before Catelyn, and the captive declares that he would offer up his sword, but he seems to have mislaid it. Catelyn asks Jaime to return her husband and daughters, but he replies that he seems to have mislaid them as well. \n\n[[Theon Greyjoy]] calls for Jaime\'s head but Robb considers the Kingslayer more valuable alive and, like his father Ned, refuses to condone the murder of prisoners. Robb orders Jaime taken away with a strong guard in part to protect him from Lord [[Rickard Karstark]], who will want vengeance for his sons [[Torrhen Karstark|Torrhen]] and [[Eddard Karstark|Eddard]] along with [[Daryn Hornwood]]. Catelyn then learns that when Jaime saw he was lost, he charged Robb\xe2\x80\x99s party, hoping to cut down Robb. Robb states that he would be dead if not for Lord Karstark\xe2\x80\x99s sons and the others. \n\nDespite these losses, the battle is a resounding victory for Robb. They have taken close to a hundred knights and a dozen lords bannermen captive. Catelyn points out that they have only won one battle, not the war. Although they took the leader, most of the Lannister host is still besieging Riverrun, and they still have to deal with Lord [[Tywin Lannister]]. Robb agrees that Catelyn is right, and declares that they still have the siege of Riverrun to defeat.\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Catelyn Stark]]\n*[[Hallis Mollen]]\n*[[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Brynden Tully]]\n*[[Olyvar Frey]]\n*[[Grey Wind]]\n*[[Torrhen Karstark]]\n*[[Eddard Karstark]]\n*[[Patrek Mallister]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Jon Umber (son of Jon)|Smalljon Umber]]\n*[[Daryn Hornwood]]\n*[[Theon Greyjoy]]\n*[[Wendel Manderly]]\n*[[Robin Flint]]\n*[[Dacey Mormont]]\n*[[Jaime Lannister]]\n*[[Galbart Glover]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Hoster Tully]]\n*[[Brandon Stark]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n*[[Jason Mallister]]\n*[[Edmure Tully]]\n*[[Walder Frey]]\n*[[Maege Mormont]]\n*[[Jon Umber|Greatjon Umber]]\n*[[Rickard Karstark]]\n| style=&quot;width:33;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Gawen Westerling]]\n*[[Quenten Banefort]]\n*[[Garth Greenfield]]\n*[[Regenard Estren]]\n*[[Tytos Brax]]\n*[[Mallor the Dornishman]]\n*[[Tywin Lannister]]\n|}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/10/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-30 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/064/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References|2}}\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 63]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Catelyn Tully]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in the Whispering Wood]]\n\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 63]]\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 64, Catelyn]]\n[[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\x9a\xd0\xb5\xd0\xb9\xd1\x82\xd0\xb8\xd0\xbb\xd0\xb8\xd0\xbd X]]</text>\n      <sha1>3mom9vpac8k8g5dhdz1lgb1c9d6gb21</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Game of Thrones-Chapter 9</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>3435</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>180943</id>\n      <parentid>165952</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2016-02-15T21:36:31Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6102">{{Infobox Chapter AGoT\n| pov\t\t= [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n| place         = [[Winterfell]]\n| title\t\t= Tyrion I\n| page\t\t= \n| previous\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 8|Bran II]]\n| current\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 9|Tyrion I]]\n| next\t\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 10|Jon II]]\n| arc previous\t=\n| arc next\t= [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 13|Tyrion II]]\n}} __NOTOC__\n\n[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] meets up with his nephew [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] and insists he pay his sympathies to the Starks, before joining his [[Jaime Lannister|brother]] and [[Cersei Lannister|sister]] for breakfast with news that [[Bran Stark]] will probably survive.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] has been reading all night in Winterfell\'s library when he hears a wolf howl. He gives up on reading, noticing that it\'s near dawn and that Septon [[Chayle]] is asleep. Tyrion wakes him and goes out to break his fast. As he leaves, Tyrion hears [[Sandor Clegane]] complaining about how long [[Bran Stark]] is taking to die. [[Joffrey Baratheon|Prince Joffrey]] states that at least Bran is dying quietly, but the wolf\'s howling is disturbing his sleep. The Hound offers to go kill it, which Joffrey finds amusing, believing the [[House Stark|Stark]]s would not notice it missing. Tyrion notes that the Starks can count past six, unlike some princes. \n\nThe Hound uses the remark as an excuse to make fun of Tyrion\'s height. Tyrion brushes the comment off before advising Joffrey to pay a visit to the Starks to offer his sympathies. When Joffrey asks what good it would do, Tyrion tells him that his absence has been noticed. Joffrey continues to refuse, but Tyrion proceeds to browbeat him to the edge of tears until the boy acquiesces. The Hound, looming over Tyrion, warns him that the prince will remember how his uncle slapped him. Tyrion responds that he hopes he does and that the Hound should be a good dog and remind Joffrey if he forgets it.\n\nTyrion then seeks out his [[Jaime Lannister|brother]] and [[Cersei Lannister|sister]], who are having breakfast in the morning room of the guest house. He asks if [[Robert Baratheon|King Robert]] is still in bed and Cersei disdainfully explains that Robert has been up all night with Lord [[Eddard Stark|Eddard]] and has taken the Starks\' sorrow deeply to heart. When Jaime adds that Robert has a big heart, Tyrion remembers that during his childhood Jaime was the only person who ever showed him any affection or respect. In return, Tyrion is willing to forgive Jaime almost anything.\n\nAs Tyrion orders breakfast, [[Tommen Baratheon|Prince Tommen]] asks after Bran and says he doesn\'t want him to die. Jaime comments on the name &quot;Brandon&quot; being [[Brandon Stark|unlucky]], but Tyrion states this may not be the case, explaining that [[Maester Luwin]] thinks that Bran may recover. As he speaks, Tyrion catches the significant glance between Jaime and Cersei. Cersei immediately insists it is no mercy for Bran to live. When [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]] asks if Bran will be alright, Tyrion replies that Bran will never walk again. Tyrion goes on to say that the [[Summer|wolf]] howling outside his window may be contributing to Bran\'s survival: when the window is closed Bran gets weaker, but his heart strengthens again when it is open. Cersei responds that the wolves disturb her and are dangerous, but Jaime tells her the girls\' wolves will doubtless follow them to [[King\'s Landing]]. \n\nTyrion then reveals to his family that he intends to visit [[the Wall]] before returning south. Jaime jokes that he hopes Tyrion is not planning to [[Night\'s Watch|take the black]], but Tyrion quips back that if he did the whores would go begging. Cersei leaves abruptly with her children, insisting they shouldn\'t hear such filth, while Jaime wonders if Eddard will leave [[Winterfell]] with Bran so ill. Tyrion insists that King Robert will make the choice for Eddard. \n\nJaime declares that if he were Eddard, he would end Bran\'s torment and save him from being a cripple. Tyrion, himself less than able-bodied, advises Jaime not to say as much to Eddard before wondering out loud what tale Bran might tell if he wakes up. Jaime is not amused and wonders aloud about Tyrion\'s loyalty. Tyrion replies that Jaime knows how much he loves his family.\n\n==Character List==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Cersei Lannister]]\n*[[Chayle]]\n*[[Jaime Lannister]]\n*[[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n*[[Myrcella Baratheon]]\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Appearing:\'\'\'\n*[[Sandor Clegane]]\n*[[Tommen Baratheon]]\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]]\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Aerys II Targaryen]]\n*[[Aethelmure]]\n*[[Ayrmidon]]\n*[[Benjen Stark]]\n*[[Bran Stark]]\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Mentioned:\'\'\'\n*[[Brandon Stark]]\n*[[Catelyn Tully]]\n*[[Eddard Stark]]\n*[[Robert Baratheon]]\n|}\n\n==Places and terms mentioned==\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;\n|- valign=&quot;top&quot;\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[Casterly Rock]]\n*[[Dorne]]\n*[[Valyria]]\n*[[Wall]]\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Places:\'\'\'\n*[[Winterfell]]\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[Direwolf]]\n*[[Engines of War]]\n*[[Maester]]\n*[[Night\'s Watch]]\n| style=&quot;width:25%;&quot; |\n\'\'\'Terms:\'\'\'\n*[[Faith of the Seven|Septon]]\n*[[House Stark]]\n*[[House Targaryen]]\n|}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://blogoficeandfire.blogspot.com/2009/05/bran-tyrion.html Humorous review of the chapter]\n*[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/04/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-5 Summary and analyses of the chapter] by Leigh Butler.\n*[http://towerofthehand.com/books/101/010/index.html Summary of the chapter] on Tower of the Hand.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{EnWikia|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 9|small=yes}}\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 09]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Tyrion Lannister|A Game of Thrones: Chapter 09]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Winterfell]]\n\n\n[[fr:A Game of Thrones, Chapitre 10, Tyrion]]\n[[es:Juego de Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 9]][[pt:A Guerra dos Tronos-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 9]][[ru:\xd0\x98\xd0\xb3\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2, \xd0\xa2\xd0\xb8\xd1\x80\xd0\xb8\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbd I]]</text>\n      <sha1>fomp55yfdrulx9sykkcyhpqopvl8f22</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 32</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>6856</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>166570</id>\n      <parentid>165642</parentid>\n      <timestamp>2015-05-25T15:46:39Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>Rhaenys Targaryen</username>\n        <id>6419</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6681">{{Infobox Chapter ADwD\n| pov\t\t= [[Theon Greyjoy]]\n| place         = [[Barrowton]]\n| title\t\t= Reek III\n| page\t\t= 420\n| previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 31|Melisandre I]]\n| current\t= Reek III\n| next\t\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 33|Tyrion VIII]]\n| arc previous\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 20|Reek II]]\n| arc next\t= [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 37|The Prince of Winterfell]]\n}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[\xe2\x80\x8eFile:Eeba-ism RS&amp;Reek.jpg|Ramsay and Theon - by Eeba-ism  \xc2\xa9|thumb|300px|left]]\n[[Ben Bones]], [[Skinner]], [[Sour Alyn]], and [[Damon Dance-for-Me]] return to the [[Goldgrass|keep]] of [[House Stout]] from a search for some [[House Frey|Frey]] men with [[Ramsay Bolton]]. [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] knows this means that Ramsay may want to take his anger out on someone, most likely Reek. He knows that Ramsay has been forced to restrain his violent outbursts in [[Barrowton]] as he needs the loyalty of the [[House Dustin|Dustins]] and [[House Ryswell|Ryswells]], but what he does behind closed doors is none of their concern. Ramsay then throws a severed head for Theon to catch, which he cannot because of his maimed hands. He does not recognize the head as it is covered in blood, rotting, and bursting with maggots.\n\nTheon is then ordered to put away the men\'s horses. He is followed by [[Walder Frey (son of Jammos)|Big Walder Frey]], who,  Theon notes, does not take after his older cousin in the malicious ways of the flayed men. Theon asks Big Walder who the man\'s head belonged to, and he replies it was just an old man who called Ramsay &quot;Lord Snow.&quot;\n\nThen there is a feast, and Theon is chained to the wall and waits his turn to eat, though the dogs provide the night\'s entertainment fighting each other for scraps. Theon remembers when Ramsay told him that [[Hunting Hounds of Ramsay Bolton|all the dogs]] are named after peasant girls he hunted, raped, flayed, and killed. He notes the next litter will likely include a [[Kyra]]. It is then that [[Roose Bolton]] enters the hall with some of his men. Here it is discovered what happened to the Frey men and why they were searching. The Freys rode ahead of the procession of the [[House Manderly|Manderlys]]. Wyman Manderly stopped frequently to feast, but the Freys rode on and disappeared. Roose says that [[Hosteen Frey]] and [[Aenys Frey]] are distressed, but Ramsay says it is of no concern, as there are plenty of Frey men at [[the Twins]]. \n\nRamsay and Roose argue; Roose says that his son is acting brash and foolish and drawing attention to himself with his cruel and barbaric amusements, that his fore-bears were no fools. He notes that they have powerful allies in the Freys and the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]], but the northmen despise them and only accept [[House Bolton]]\'s authority grudgingly (with only the exception of Lady [[Barbrey Dustin]], whose support Ramsay would cast aside because she hates him; Roose points out that Lady Dustin was fond of his late son, [[Domeric Bolton]], and holds Ramsay responsible for his death). They talk briefly about the dead sons of the [[House Stark|Starks]], and what might happen if they were to &quot;return&quot; from the dead; Roose angrily chides his son for openly discussing his part in the [[Sack of Winterfell]], pointing out that their northern vassals would turn on them in an instant if they learned the truth. Roose then changes the subject by informing Ramsay that [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] has marched from the Wall, adding that it is not towards the intended trap at the [[Dreadfort]] that the [[House Karstark|Karstarks]] baited, thus revealing that the Karstarks are double-crossing Stannis.&lt;ref&gt;House Karstark declared for Stannis in [[A Dance with Dragons-Chapter 3|Chapter 3]]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nRoose tells Ramsay he is to wed [[Jeyne Poole|the fake Arya Stark]] not in Barrowton, but in [[Winterfell]]. By doing so, the clansmen who follow Stannis will be incensed to march on the keep, something they would not do while the Boltons are in Barrowton; once Stannis lays siege to Winterfell, Arnolf will turn on him there. Roose then takes Theon away from Ramsay. Ramsay tells Theon to observe everything and report back to him, but he is to say nothing about his treatment to Roose.\n\nAs they ride to [[Barrow Hall]], Roose tells Theon he knows what his bastard son has asked of him. He goes on to say that he knows what the real [[Reek]] was like, the opposite of what Ramsay has turned Theon into. He notes that he provided the first Reek as a servant to the unruly young Ramsay; he had intended it to be a cruel joke, but is now uncertain whether Reek corrupted Ramsay or the other way around. Ramsay was the child of a rape, one that Roose is not proud of; he chanced upon the beautiful young wife of an old miller while out hunting and decided to practice the illicit tradition of the [[first night]], having the miller hanged and then taking the man\'s wife. The woman showed up at the Dreadfort a year later with baby Ramsay; Roose had intended to have the woman whipped and the infant thrown down a well, but when he saw the child had his eyes, Roose stayed his hand and agreed to aid them- he gave the woman back the farm her husband\'s brother had stolen from her, had the man\'s tongue cut out to stop him telling tales to [[Rickard Stark]], Roose\'s liege, and periodically sent the woman a few pigs, chickens and coin to help bring up the bastard child on the condition she never tell the boy who his father was. He thinks that the woman may have had a hand in turning Ramsay on to desiring goals outside the rights of a bastard. They also discuss Domeric Bolton, Roose\'s true-born son, whom Roose suspects was killed by Ramsay. He also suspects that any trueborn sons he has with his [[Walda Frey (daughter of Merrett)|new wife]] Ramsay will likely kill, though he admits this might be best, as he believes he will not live long enough to raise new sons to manhood and considers child lords the bane of a House.\n\nThey finally arrive at Barrow Hall, where Theon is brought to Barbrey Dustin, Lady of Barrowton. He is introduced as Theon Greyjoy, true Lord of the Iron Islands, which frightens Theon into fits, having been tortured into calling himself Reek. She asks Roose if Theon has gone mad, and he replies he most likely has, but it doesn\'t matter. Theon claims he is not the turncloak, he died at Winterfell.\n\n==References and Notes==\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters|A Dance with Dragons 32]]\n[[Category: A Song of Ice And Fire chapters--POV Theon Greyjoy]]\n[[Category:Chapters which take place in Barrowton]]\n\n[[es:Danza de Dragones-Cap\xc3\xadtulo 32]]\n[[fr:A Dance with Dragons, Chapitre 33, Schlingue]]</text>\n      <sha1>87rfmlgoetx7rz1gon8am1h59wlpf0v</sha1>\n      <model>wikitext</model>\n      <format>text/x-wiki</format>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n</mediawiki>\n'
